Abstract: Hearing and balance deficits have been reported during and following treatment

29

with the antimalarial drug chloroquine. However, experimental work examining the direct

30

actions of chloroquine on mechanoreceptive hair cells in common experimental models is

31

lacking. This study examines the effects of chloroquine on hair cells using two common

32

experimental models: the zebrafish lateral line and neonatal mouse cochlear cultures.

33

Zebrafish larvae were exposed to varying concentrations of chloroquine phosphate or

34

hydroxychloroquine for 1 hr or 24 hr, and hair cells assessed by antibody staining. A

35

significant, dose-dependent reduction in the number of surviving hair cells was seen

36

across conditions for both exposure periods. Hydroxycholroquine showed similar toxicity.

37

In mouse cochlear cultures, chloroquine damage was specific to outer hair cells in tissue

38

from the cochlear basal turn, consistent with susceptibility to other ototoxic agents. These

39

findings suggest a need for future studies employing hearing and balance monitoring

40

during exposure to chloroquine and related compounds, particularly with interest in these

41

compounds as therapeutics against viral infections including coronavirus.

1. Introduction:

44

Quinoline antimalarial drugs have long been implicated as a cause of hearing loss,

45

tinnitus, dizziness, and severe imbalance (Bernard, 1985; Hart and Naunton, 1964; Matz

46

and Naunton, 1968; Mukherjee, 1979). This side effect profile prompted the transition from

47

quinine to chloroquine, and further development of hydroxychloroquine (Matz and

48

Naunton, 1968; Scherbel et al., 1958; Shrivastav et al., 2016). Chloroquine interferes with

49

parasite growth in red blood cells, thereby protecting against or disrupting the progression

50

of malaria (Hoppe et al., 2004; Kapishnikov et al., 2019). Despite the development of new

51

drugs for the prevention and treatment of malaria, their ototoxic side effects have

52

persisted.

53

Chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine have many uses in addition to being anti-malarial

54

agents, and may therefore cause adverse events in multiple patient populations.

55

Chloroquine or hydroxychloroquine are also commonly prescribed to treat autoimmune

56

and collagen conditions such as rheumatoid arthritis, scleroderma, and systemic lupus

57

erythematosus, as well as amebiasis (Bernard, 1985; Matz and Naunton, 1968) and other

58

off-label applications (Al-Bari, 2015; Bogaczewicz and Sobów, 2017; Plantone and

59

Koudriavtseva, 2018); these patients are more likely to experience ear-related symptoms

60

due to the higher dosing and prolonged exposure to chloroquine. Most recently

61

chloroquine has been promoted as a therapeutic against coronavirus disease COVID-19

62

(Cortegiani et al., 2020; Sahraei et al., 2020; Zhou et al., 2020).

63

Patients receiving chloroquine may experience sensorineural hearing loss—as extreme

64

as a complete loss of mid- and high-frequency hearing—(Mukherjee, 1979), tinnitus

65

(Bernard, 1985), and vestibular deficits such as vestibular paresis (Matz and Naunton,

66

1968; Mukherjee, 1979), as quickly as two hours after an injection of chloroquine

67

(Mukherjee and Mukherjee, 1979). These side effects are all associated with the inner ear

68

sensory structures, raising the suspicion of objective ototoxicity. Hydroxychloroquine has

69

been associated with similar side effects, with over 700 reported adverse events linked to

70

the ear and labyrinthine structure in the United States in the last 5 years (U.S. Food and

71

Drug Administration, 2019).

72

Unfortunately, knowledge of adverse effects has largely come from case studies,

73

leaving the mechanisms and prevalence of these effects to be unclear. Both reversible

74

(Bernard, 1985; Mukherjee, 1979) and irreversible (Bernard, 1985; Matz and Naunton,

75

1968; Toone et al., 1965) symptoms concerning hearing and balance have been reported,

76

but there is little understanding how these antimalarial drugs affect the structures of the

77

inner ear and central nervous system involved in hearing and balance. Additionally, there is

78

a lack of animal studies exploring the direct effects of chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine

79

on the peripheral auditory system, and specifically, on mechanosensory hair cells. Here,

80

we use the zebrafish lateral line and mouse neonatal cochlear cultures to test the effect of

81

chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine on mechanosensory hair cell survival.

82

The zebrafish lateral line is a good model for understanding hair cell function and

83

dysfunction (Harris et al., 2003; Ou et al., 2012; Pickett et al., 2018). The lateral line is a

84

system of mechanosensory hair cells on the surface of body that allows fish to detect fluid

85

displacement. Inputs from this system provide a way for fish to orient themselves in water

86

for behaviors such as schooling and predator avoidance (Bak-Coleman et al., 2013;

87

Thomas et al., 2015). The system consists of neuromasts, clusters of hair cells surrounded

88

by support cells. These hair cells depolarize as their stereocilia are displaced and send

89

signals to the brain with associated nerve fibers, similar to the functions of hair cells in the

90

auditory and vestibular labyrinth. Lateral line hair cells are easily accessible for experimental

91

manipulation and provide a rapid system for screening compounds for ototoxicity (Chiu et

92

al., 2008; Hirose et al., 2011; Owens et al., 2008) as well as investigating the specific

93

mechanisms of toxin entry into the cell and subsequent cell death (Hailey et al., 2017;

94

Owens et al., 2008; Santos et al., 2006). In addition, the zebrafish lateral line system has

95

been used to screen for small molecules that protect hair cells from damage, with

96

translation to mammalian systems (Chowdhury et al., 2018; Kitcher et al., 2019). Previous

97

work in this system has largely focused on aminoglycoside antibiotics and cisplatin, known

98

ototoxins that cause irreversible hearing and balance disorders in human patients. We then

99

compared the effect of chloroquine in lateral line hair cells, an in vivo system, to their effect

100

on neonatal mouse cochlear cultures, an established in vitro model for hair cell toxicity

101

(Kotecha and Richardson, 1994; Richardson and Russell, 1991) Other known ototoxins

102

cause comparable loss of hair cells in both systems (Kirkwood et al., 2017; Kitcher et al.,

103

2019).

104

Here, we report that chloroquine causes specific loss of mechanosensory hair cells in

105

the zebrafish lateral line and in the cultured neonatal mouse cochlea. We find rapid, dose-

106

dependent cell death due to exposure to these compounds. We suggest that chloroquine-

107

associated hearing loss and vestibular impairment in human patients may be due to loss of

108

hair cells and warrants further study in vivo in mature mammals.

2. Methods:

111

Procedures have been approved by the University of Washington Animal Care and Use

112

Committee.

113
114
115

2.1 Zebrafish studies
Adult zebrafish (Danio rerio) were paired to produce embryos in the University of

116

Washington fish facility. Embryos raised at 50 embryos per 100 mm2 petri dish in E2

117

embryo medium (14.97 mM NaCl, 500 μM KCl, 42 μM Na2HPO4, 150 μM KH2PO4, 1

118

mM CaCl2 dihydrate, 1 mM MgSO4, 0.714 mM NaHCO3, pH 7.2) and raised in an

119

incubator at 28.5ºC. At four days post-fertilization (dpf), larvae were fed live rotifers.

120

At 5–7 dpf, larvae were placed in 48-well plates with 10–12 larvae per well, each

121

well containing a different concentration of chloroquine in 300 µL of embryo medium. This

122

study used concentrations ranging from 25 to 1600 µM with either 1- or 24-hour exposure

123

periods. Effects of hydroxychloroquine were investigated up to 400 µM.

124

Following exposure to the drug, zebrafish larvae were euthanized and then fixed in

125

4% paraformaldehyde overnight. Larvae were rinsed with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS)

126

and then placed in blocking solution (1 % Triton-X 100, 5 % normal goat serum (NGS) in

127

PBS) at room temperature for 1–2 hours. Zebrafish were then placed in an anti-

128

parvalbumin antibody solution (monoclonal, 1:400 in 1% Triton-X, 1 % NGS, in PBS) at 4

129

°C overnight and then rinsed with 1% Triton-X 100 in PBS (PBS-T) thrice. Larvae were

130

then placed in a secondary solution with Alexa 488 goat anti-mouse H+L fluorescent

131

antibody (1:500, in 1 % Triton-X 100, 1 % NGS, in PBS) for 4 hours. Following the

132

secondary antibody solution, zebrafish were rinsed with PBS-T and PBS, before being

133

mounted with Fluoromount-G (Southern Biotech, Birmingham, AL, USA) between two

134

coverslips (VWR Cat #84393-251). Hair cells were counted in four neuromasts (SO1, SO2,

135

O1, and OC1) per fish using a Zeiss Axioplan II microscope at a total magnification of 200X

136

(40X objective; N.A.=0.75) with FITC filtered fluorescent illumination.

137
138
139

2.2 Cochlear cultures
Cochlear cultures were prepared from C57BL/6J mice according to previously

140

described protocols (Kitcher et al., 2019; Russell and Richardson, 1987). Explants were

141

prepared from pups sacrificed at postnatal day 2 and plated on collagen covered

142

coverslips with 50 µL of cochlear culture medium (93% DMEM-F12, 7% FBS and 10 μg/ml

143

ampicillin). The culture and coverslip were incubated overnight in a Maximow slide

144

assembly at 37˚C.

145

Experiments were carried out in 2 mL total volume of modified culture media

146

(98.6% DMEM-F12, 1.4% FBS and 10 μg/ml ampicillin) with varying concentration of

147

chloroquine. After 24 hours of incubation, cultures were washed once with PBS, fixed in

148

4% paraformaldehyde for 1 hour at room temperature. Hair cells were labeled with 1:1000

149

Phalloidin conjugated to Alexa Fluor 568 (Invitrogen, A12380) and 1:1000 anti-Myosin-VIIa

150

rabbit polyclonal antibody (Santa Cruz, sc-74516), 1:1000 anti-Sox2 polyclonal antibody

151

overnight followed by 1:500 Alexa Fluor 488 and 1:500 Alexa Fluor 694 goat anti-rabbit

152

IgG (Invitrogen, A-11034).

153

Tissue was imaged at the midpoint of the apical region and at the midpoint of the

154

basal region of the cochlear coil using an Axioplan ll (Zeiss) upright microscope at a final

155

magnification of 200x. MyosinVIIa labeled hair cell bodies and Sox2 labeled support cell

156

nuclei were counted in a 100 µm length along the sensory epithelium of each microscope

157

field. A statistical power analysis based on previous experiments in this system, with an

158

alpha of 0.05 and power = 0.80 indicated that a minimum of n= 4 samples per group

159

would be required (Rosner, 2011).

2.3 Data Analysis

162

Total hair cells remaining were compared to counts of the same neuromasts of untreated

163

fish or untreated cochlear cultures to calculate the percentage of hair cells remaining. Hair

164

cell survival was then related to concentration of chloroquine used in incubation. Data was

165

analyzed by t-tests, and by one-way or two-way ANOVAs with posthoc comparisons

166

using GraphPad Prism.

167
168
169

3. Results:
To test the potential toxic effects of chloroquine, zebrafish were treated with

170

differing concentrations of drug. Neuromasts displayed clearly visible hair cell death after

171

treatment for 24h (Figure 1A,B), with increasing hair cell loss after exposure to increasing

172

chloroquine concentrations during 24h exposure (Figure 1C). Significant differences in hair

173

cell numbers were found between control conditions and concentrations of 100 µM and

174

higher (100, 200, 400, 800, 1600) (p<0.05). Hair cell survival reached an apparent

175

asymptote around 65% with concentrations of 400 µM and higher (400, 800, 1600). In

176

subsequent experiments, concentrations were limited to 0–400 µM dosages. Figure 1D

177

compares the effects of treating zebrafish with chloroquine for 1h and 24h. Two-way

178

ANOVA with dose and exposure time as main factors yielded a highly significant main

179

effect of concentration (F=12, p<0.0001), but insignificant effects of exposure time

180

(F=3.06, p=0.0828) and a significant interaction term (F=4.5, p=0.0009). These results

181

demonstrate that chloroquine exposure results in a rapid dose-dependent loss of zebrafish

182

lateral line hair cells.

183

As hydroxychloroquine is often used to replace chloroquine in clinical settings,

184

these two drugs were compared for relative hair cell toxicity. Both drugs showed dose-

185

dependent hair cell loss (Figure 2). Hydroxychloroquine showed slightly more toxicity than

186

chloroquine (F=4.774, p=0.03; two-way ANOVA). These results demonstrate that both

187

clinically-relevant chloroquine drugs show hair cell toxicity in the zebrafish model.

188

Previous work has demonstrated that quinoline drugs, including chloroquine, can

189

inhibit aminoglycoside ototoxicity by partially blocking mechanotransduction-dependent

190

toxin uptake (Ou et al., 2012). We reasoned that the asymptotic nature of the chloroquine

191

dose-response function might be due to its ability to block its own uptake. We performed

192

two sets of experiments to test this idea. Function of the mechanotransduction channel

193

was assessed through quantification of FM1-43X uptake after pre-treatment with

194

chloroquine at doses that cause maximal hair cell death. Fish were also treated with

195

benzamil, a MET channel blocker known to block drug uptake (Hailey et al., 2017; Rüsch

196

et al., 1994) as a positive control (Figure 3). Chloroquine pre-treatment did not significantly

197

alter FM1-43X uptake (p=0.2334; Dunn’s multiple comparison test), while benzamil-treated

198

fish showed a highly significant decrease in FM1-43X uptake compared to controls

199

(p<0.0001; Figure 3 A-D). We then examined whether chloroquine toxicity itself was

200

altered by MET blockers (Figure 4). Neither 50 µM nor 200 µM benzamil co-treatment had

201

a significant effect on chloroquine toxicity (p=0.9698 and 0.4943, respectively; Sidak’s

202

multiple comparison test). Together these experiments suggest that the plateau of the

203

dose-response function is not due to chloroquine effects on mechanotransduction.

204

To test whether mammalian hair cells degenerate in response to chloroquine,

205

neonatal mouse cochlear cultures were exposed to 0–200 µM chloroquine for 24 hours

206

(Figure 5). We compared responses of cultures from apical (Figure 5B) and basal (Figure

207

5C) regions of the cochlea. Apical regions showed no significant inner or outer hair cell loss

208

with increasing concentrations of chloroquine (F=0.91, p=0.45; two-way ANOVA) Basal

209

areas showed increasing hair cells loss with increasing chloroquine exposure (F=27.43, p

210

<0.0001; two-way ANOVA). As for other ototoxins, basal outer hair cells were significantly

211

more sensitive to chloroquine than inner hair cells (F=26.11, p <0.0001; two-way ANOVA).

212

Analyses of the basal coil revealed that outer hair cells were significantly damaged

213

(p<0.001) with 50% loss at 100 µM chloroquine exposure and almost complete loss was

214

seen at 200 µM exposure, while there was a significant loss (p<0.05) of approximately

215

25% inner hair cells at the highest concentration. In order to evaluate any effects of

216

chloroquine on supporting cells, Sox2-positive cells located between the inner hair cells

217

and first row of outer hair cells were counted and compared to controls. A two-way

218

ANOVA indicated no significant loss of chloroquine on supporting cell survival in either the

219

apex or the base of cultures at any concentration (p>0.05). Together these results

220

demonstrate that chloroquine damage at the concentrations tested is targeted to the hair

221

cells and, like most other ototoxic drugs, most severely compromises basal turn outer hair

222

cells as compared to inner hair cells.

223
224
225

4. Discussion:
This study describes dose-response analyses for the effects of chloroquine in the

226

zebrafish anterior lateral line and in neonatal murine cochlear cultures. Chloroquine

227

exposure was found to cause hair cell loss in both models. In zebrafish, variation in

228

exposure time (1 hr vs 24 hr) did not result in significant differences in hair cell loss,

229

implying that chloroquine uptake is rapid and affects hair cells soon after they are exposed.

230

Exposure to hydroxychloroquine yielded comparable results to those from chloroquine

231

exposure. For mouse cochlear cultures, reduction in hair cell counts were most dramatic in

232

basal regions and in outer hair cells, consistent with differences in the sensitivity of hair

233

cells to other ototoxins and reported hearing loss being limited to or most profound at high

234

frequencies with most other ototoxins (Bielefeld et al., 2018; Chowdhury et al., 2018;

235

Kotecha and Richardson, 1994). While there are no in vivo mammalian studies to compare

236

with the results presented here, these results are consistent with the absence of hair cells

237

with fetal exposure to chloroquine (Matz & Naunton, 1968).

238

Chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine have good oral bioavailability and reach high

239

plasma levels in patients. Their pharmacokinetic profiles indicate extremely long elimination

240

half-lives on (weeks to months) and large volumes of distribution indicating significant

241

partitioning into tissues including cerebrospinal fluid (White 1985). Given these

242

pharmacokinetic characteristics, it is entirely possible that drug concentration in the inner

243

ear reach micromolar concentrations used in the experiments described here.

244

Because quinine users commonly reported similar side effects to that of patients

245

taking chloroquine, it can be posited that the effects of these structurally-related quinoline

246

drugs with the tissues of the inner ear are comparable. These results are consistent with

247

reports of audiological and vestibular dysfunction after quinine treatment for malaria

248

prophylaxis or treatment (Hennebert and Fernández, 1959; Karlsson et al., 1990; Nielsen-

249

Abbring et al., 1990; Phillips-Howard and ter Kuile, 1995; Roche et al., 1990). Studies of

250

quinine ototoxicity have shown extensive damage and deterioration of the stria vascularis

251

and organ of Corti, especially to outer hair cells (Hennebert and Fernández, 1959).

252

Exposed animals displayed minimal damage in the vestibular system, and impacted

253

vestibular function recovered with time. Peripheral auditory function was reduced with

254

quinine injections—acutely exposed animals improved fully or partially, and those receiving

255

chronic dosing remained affected.

256

The mechanism by which chloroquine acts to kill hair cells is not yet known. The

257

pharmacological mechanisms of action of chloroquine are subject of some controversy but

258

is widely considered to be due to its accumulation in lysosomes and subsequent

259

disruption of their function (Kaufmann et al., 2009). Lysosomes have emerged as

260

organelles with critical signaling roles regulating many aspects of cellular function (reviewed

261

by Xu and Ren, 2015). They also play central roles in autophagy, the process by which

262

cellular components are recycled (reviewed in Parzych and Klionsky, 2014). Chloroquine's

263

effects on lysosomes are likely to have effects on diverse downstream cellular processes

264

including receptor signaling, with anti-inflammatory consequences (Wallace et al., 2012),

265

and autophagy, with anti-tumor effects (Levy et al., 2017). There may therefore be multiple

266

effects of chloroquine on hair cell function with consequences to their survival.

267

While both zebrafish and mouse cochlear hair cells are sensitive to chloroquine,

268

there are differences in the nature of the dose-response functions. Loss of zebrafish hair

269

cells approached an asymptote of about 40% reduction without further loss at higher

270

concentrations of chloroquine, while basal outer hair cells in mouse cochlear cultures

271

approach 100% loss with increasing dose. The underlying causes of asymptotic nature of

272

the zebrafish dose-response function is unknown. We hypothesized that chloroquine may

273

reduce its uptake and toxicity at higher concentrations by blocking hair cell

274

mechanotransduction, a property required for the hair cell entry of some other compounds

275

in zebrafish, including aminoglycosides and cisplatin (Thomas et al., 2012; Hailey et al.

276

2017). Although other quinoline loop derivatives have been shown to interfere with

277

mechanotransduction (Farris et al., 2004; Ou et al., 2012), we found little effect of

278

chloroquine on mechanotransduction-dependent FM1-43 dye uptake in zebrafish.

279

Moreover we found that interfering with mechanotransduction had little effect on

280

chloroquine toxicity. We suggest that there may be other reasons for incomplete toxicity in

281

zebrafish, such as effective sequestration or efflux mechanisms that engage at higher

282

chloroquine concentrations to protect hair cells.

283

Further research is needed to fully investigate mechanisms of hair cell death in the

284

presence of chloroquine and more broadly how this class of drugs affect patients in their

everyday lives. In addition to potential side effects directly detrimental to auditory

286

perception and vestibular function, changes in these perceptual outcomes can create an

287

increase in anxiety, depression, and fatigue resulting in a decrease in quality of life (Coelho

288

and Balaban, 2015; Gomaa et al., 2014; Hornsby et al., 2016; Mira, 2008; Ohlenforst et

289

al., 2017). Given the interest of chloroquine as a therapy for viral infections including Zika

290

and SARS coronaviruses (Al-Bari, 2017), it will be important to consider monitoring

291

auditory and vestibular function as these drugs are adopted to new therapies.

Figure 1: Chloroquine causes dose-dependent hair cell loss in the zebrafish lateral line

460

system. Fluorescent imaging showed robust hair cell numbers in control neuromasts (A)

461

and reduced numbers in fish exposed to 400 µM chloroquine for 24h (B). Hair cell counts

462

show a decrease in hair cell viability as chloroquine concentration increased (F=12.28,

463

p<0.0001;C). However, there was no significant change with concentrations from 400 µM

464

to 1600 µM (p>0.05). (D) This pattern was consistent between 24- and 1- hour exposure

465

times with no statistical significance (F=3.06, p = 0.0828). Error bars represent ±1

466

standard deviation. Scale bar = 10 µm.

467
468

Figure 2: Hydroxychloroquine causes dose-dependent effects on hair cells in the zebrafish

469

lateral line, similar to chloroquine. Dose-response functions show that hair cells exposed to

470

hydroxychloroquine (solid line) survive at a similar rate as those exposed to chloroquine

471

(dashed line) after a 24-hour treatment period. Two-way ANOVA demonstrate a small, but

472

significant effect, with hydroxychloroquine being slightly more toxic (F=4.774, p=0.03).

473

Error bars represent ±1 standard deviation.

474
475

Figure 3: Chloroquine does not reduce MET channel activity. Fluorescent imaging showed

476

no reduction of FM1-43-X uptake with pre-exposure to chloroquine (A–C). Brn3c fish, that

477

have green fluorescent membrane markers, had no pre-treatment (A–A”), 1000 µM

478

chloroquine for 15 minutes (B–B”), or 200 µM benzamil for 15 minutes (C–C”). Dunn’s

479

multiple comparisons confirmed that red fluorescence is not significantly attenuated in fish

480

pre-treated with a high dose of chloroquine (p=0.2334), while uptake is significantly lower

481

in those fish treated with benzamil (p<0.0001), a known MET channel blocker (D; n=6–8

482

fish per condition). Error bars represent ±1 standard deviation. Scale bar = 10 µm

483
484

Figure 4: Chloroquine-induced cell death is not affected by the presence of a MET channel

485

blocker. Co-treatment of chloroquine and benzamil showed no significant change in hair

486

cell viability, though chloroquine exposure did have a small but significant effect on hair cell

487

survival (p<0.0001). Error bars represent ±1 standard deviation.

Figure 5: Chloroquine exposure causes dose-dependent hair cell loss in neonatal mouse

489

organ of Corti cultures. (A) Fluorescent imaging of basal turn cultures treated with 0, 50,

490

100, and 200 µM chloroquine and labelled with antibodies specific to hair cells (Myosin

491

Vlla), or organ of Corti supporting cells (Sox2), or all nuclei (DAPI). Note that 50 µM

492

chloroquine exposure (row labeled 50 µM CQ) did not reveal clear loss or disruption of any

493

cell type (compare with top row (0 µM CQ). However, 100 µM and 200 µM chloroquine

494

exposure resulted in moderate and extreme loss of outer hair cells, respectively.

495

Conversely, there was no obvious loss of other cell types at any treatment condition. (B)

496

Apical coil cultures demonstrate little or no loss of inner or outer hair cells following

497

treatment with chloroquine at any of the concentrations used (p=0.6087). (C) Basal coil

498

hair cells, however, showed significantly decreased viability when treated with chloroquine

499

(p<0.0001), and outer hair cells in the base were more dramatically affected by drug

500

exposure than inner hair cells (F=26.11, p<0.0001). Error bars represent ±1 standard
