Abstract

22

Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) poses an acute threat to public health

23

and the world economy, especially because no approved specific drugs or vaccines are available.

24

Pharmacological modulation of metabolism-dependent cellular pathways such as autophagy reduced

25

propagation of highly pathogenic Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS)-CoV.

26

Here we show that SARS-CoV-2 infection limits autophagy by interfering with multiple metabolic

27

pathways and that compound-driven interventions aimed at autophagy induction reduce SARS-CoV-2

28

propagation in vitro. In-depth analyses of autophagy signaling and metabolomics indicate that SARS-

29

CoV-2 reduces glycolysis and protein translation by limiting activation of AMP-protein activated kinase

30

(AMPK) and mammalian target of rapamycin complex 1 (mTORC1). Infection also downregulates

31

autophagy-inducing spermidine, and facilitates AKT1/SKP2-dependent degradation of autophagy-

32

initiating Beclin-1 (BECN1). Targeting of these pathways by exogenous administration of spermidine,

33

AKT inhibitor MK-2206, and the Beclin-1 stabilizing, antihelminthic drug niclosamide inhibited SARS-

34

CoV-2 propagation by 85, 88, and >99%, respectively. In sum, SARS-CoV-2 infection causally diminishes

35

autophagy. A clinically approved and well-tolerated autophagy-inducing compound shows potential

36

for evaluation as a treatment against SARS-CoV-2.

39

The current pandemic of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) poses an

40

imminent threat to global health. As of 15 April 2020, 1,878,489 individuals were infected in >200

41

countries, with >119,000 fatalities (1). SARS-CoV-2 infections cause CoV-associated disease 19 (COVID-

42

19), which can lead to severe atypical pneumonia in humans (2). Currently, there are no approved

43

therapeutics or vaccines available. The development and licensing of new FDA-approved drugs takes

44

years, which is problematic given the urgent need for effective therapies against novel, rapidly

45

emergent diseases like COVID-19. Antiviral drug screenings are commonly based on testing FDA-

46

approved compound libraries against cellular and viral components (3). However, these undirected

47

approaches lack functional insights into how the drugs affect virus propagation. Risk evaluations for

48

drug repurposing and development of new therapeutics would benefit from rational drug design

49

founded on known SARS-CoV-2-host interactions.

50

Compound-based targeting of cellular proteins that are essential for the virus life cycle has led to the

51

discovery of broadly reactive drugs against a range of CoVs (3-6). As virus propagation strongly

52

depends on energy and catabolic substrates of host cells, drug target identification should consider

53

the metabolism of infected cells (3). Autophagy, a highly conserved cytosolic degradation process of

54

long-lived proteins, lipids, and organelles in eukaryotic cells, is tightly controlled by metabolism (7, 8).

55

During autophagy, intracellular macromolecules are recycled by incorporation into LC3B-lipidated

56

autophagosomes (AP) and degradation into their monomers, such as fatty and amino acids, after

57

fusion with low pH lysosomes (9). In the case of highly pathogenic Middle East respiratory syndrome

58

(MERS)-CoV, we recently showed that autophagy is limited by a virus-induced AKT1-dependent

59

activation of the E3-ligase S-phase kinase-associated protein 2 (SKP2), which targets the key autophagy

60

initiating protein Beclin-1 (BECN1) for proteasomal degradation (10). Congruently, inhibition of SKP2

61

by different compounds, including clinically approved drugs, stabilized BECN1 and limited MERS-CoV

62

propagation, indicating that autophagy-inducing compounds hold promise for evaluation as antiviral

63

drugs. This paper investigates the impact of SARS-CoV-2 infection on cell metabolism and the

64

downstream effects on autophagy, thereby identifying multiple targets for the application of approved

65

drugs and the development of new antiviral therapies.

66

We aimed to characterize the effect of SARS-CoV-2 infection on autophagy by applying previously

67

established assays (10) and additionally including detailed analyses of upstream autophagy regulators

68

according to expert-curated guidelines for detecting autophagy (11). First, we explored whether SARS-

69

CoV-2 reduces autophagic flux, a measure of autophagic degradation activity. We infected human

70

bronchial epithelial cells NCI-H1299 and monkey kidney cells (VeroFM) with SARS-CoV-2 strain Munich

71

(multiplicity of infection (MOI) of 0.0005) or heat-inactivated virus (mock-infected cells) and tested

72

autophagic flux by co-treatment with bafilomycin A1 (BafA1). BafA1 is a specific inhibitor of vacuolar

73

H+-ATPase interfering with lysosome acidification and degradation of AP cargo and preventing the

74

fusion of APs with lysosomes to autophagy-active autophagolysosomes (AL) (11). Based on our

75

previous experience (10), we chose a low MOI of 0.0005 and time points 8, 24, and 48 hours post

76

infection to monitor autophagy during the exponential growth of SARS-CoV-2 reaching maximum titers

77

of 107 genome equivalents per ml (GE/ml; NCI-H1299) and 1010 GE/ml (VeroFM) at 48 hours post

78

infection (Figure S1a). We found that 100 nM of BafA1 was sufficient to induce maximal LC3B lipidation

79

levels in both cell cultures (Figure S1b-d). Immunoblotting of LC3B-II/I in the presence of 100 nM BafA1

80

indicated that mock-infected compared to SARS-CoV-2-infected cells showed a significant increase of

81

LC3B-II over LC3B-I due to the BafA1-induced inhibition of autophagic flux (Figures 1a-b). At 8 hours

82

post infection, LC3B-II levels were slightly elevated in SARS-CoV-2-infected cells but could still be

83

enhanced by BafA1 treatment. At 24 and 48 hours, (vehicle- or) BafA1-treated and SARS-CoV-2

84

infected cells showed equally limited autophagic flux (Figures 1a-b). A reduction of autophagic flux

85

was further corroborated by elevated levels of the autophagy receptor SQSTM1/P62 in SARS-CoV-2-

86

infected cells (Figures 1c-d). Furthermore, we used a well-established autophagy reporter plasmid,

87

ptfLC3, to assess lysosomal-autophagosomal fusion, a hallmark of autophagic flux (12). The number of

88

ALs (in red) in mRFP and EGFP dual-tagged LC3B-expressing and SARS-CoV-2 infected NCI-H1299 cells

89

was clearly reduced compared to mock-infected cells (Figures 1e-f), indicating virus-induced reduction

90

of AP and AL fusion. Quantification showed that the total number of ALs was reduced from a mean of

91

88 to 62 vesicles per cell, whereas the number of APs per cell was comparable (Mock = 56 vesicles/cell;

92

SARS-CoV-2 = 51 vesicles/cell). The ratio of APs to ALs shifted in SARS-CoV-2-infected cells, indicating

93

strong AP accumulation (Mock= 0.707±0.053; SARS-CoV-2= 0.921 ± 0.058) (Figure 1e). Taken together,

94

SARS-CoV-2 strongly reduced the autophagic flux in both cell lines, in a fashion similar to MERS-CoV

95

(10).

96

The initiation of autophagy is a cumulative result of multiple protein and signaling cascades that are

97

involved in the energy and nutrient sensing of cells (7, 11). The AMP- activated protein kinase (AMPK)

98

and the mammalian target of rapamycin complex 1 (mTORC1) kinase are in continuous crosstalk with

99

glucose and protein homeostasis respectively (13, 14). We monitored key proteins of the AMPK and

100

mTORC1 pathways and their regulation/degradation by Western blot analyses after infection with

101

SARS-CoV-2 (Figure 2). SARS-CoV-2 infection influenced most of the analyzed components of the

102

AMPK/mTORC1 pathway. Phosphorylated, active forms of AMPK, AMPK substrates (LXRXX), AMPK

103

downstream targets (TSC2 and ULK1), and mTORC1 were downregulated upon SARS-CoV-2 infection,

104

suggesting a virus-induced reduction of cellular glycolysis, protein translation, and cell growth. In

105

addition, we found increased levels of phosphorylated AKT1, which activates the negative regulator of

106

BECN1, SKP2 (10). Low BECN1 levels and subsequently reduced ATG14 phosphorylation and

107

oligomerization (Figure 2, lower left panel) explain the lack of fusion of APs with lysosomes observed

108

in Figure 1e-f as ATG14 oligomers facilitate fusion via SNARE-proteins, SNAP29 and STX17 (10). In

109

summary, SARS-CoV-2 alters autophagy-relevant signaling and at the same time appears to hamper

110

AP/lysosome fusion efficiency via autophagy.

111

To further explore the direct impact of SARS-CoV-2 infection on AMPK/mTORC1, we performed a

112

metabolomics profiling analysis in VeroFM cells 24 hours post infection using an elevated MOI of 0.1

113

to guarantee ubiquitous infection of cells (Figure 3). The metabolite profiles were analyzed by

114

multivariate principal component analysis (PCA), an unsupervised statistical method suitable for

115

analyzing and classifying metabolomics datasets (15). The profiles clearly separated into SARS-CoV-2

116

and control group (Figure S2a). Altogether, the levels of 25 metabolites were significantly altered by

117

SARS-CoV-2 infection (Supplementary Table 1). We performed pathway analyses in order to gain

118

insights into the cellular and mechanistic consequences of a SARS-CoV-2 infection. We retrieved eight

119

affected pathways using the significantly altered metabolites from Supplementary Table 1 (Figure 3a).

120

Glutathione (GSH) metabolism, pyrimidine metabolism, and aminoacyl-tRNA biosynthesis had the

121

most pronounced changes. Metabolites of the butanoate metabolism as well as the alanine, aspartate

122

and glutamate metabolism were also elevated. In contrast, the tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle, glutamine

123

and glutamate metabolism, and glyoxylate and dicarboxylate metabolism were reduced by SARS-CoV-

124

2. The volcano plot visualizes the metabolites with large magnitude fold changes. We identified seven

125

altered metabolites: Cys-glycine, N-acetylputrescine, adenosine, putrescine, homocysteine and

126

cysteine levels were elevated whereas fructose-6P was strongly depleted (Figure 3b). Putative links

127

between the different pathways during SARS-CoV-2 infection are shown in Figure 3c. We observed

128

elevated ATP levels that might facilitate energy-dependent processes such as virus replication and

129

entry (Figure 3c, blue). High lactic acid and low fructose-6P levels indicate exhaustive glycolysis activity

130

(Figure 3c, green). Decreased levels of TCA metabolites (Figure 3c, purple) further support a switch

131

from (mitochondria-dependent) oxidative phosphorylation to lactic acid fermentation, to provide

132

NAD+ for glycolytic ATP production. Consequently, we observed a reduced AMP/ATP ratio (Figure 3c,

133

blue) limiting AMPK activation (16) and subsequently autophagy (see Figure 2). Limited autophagy

134

might prevent degradation of viral products and might enhance the availability of non-autophagic

135

membrane material to generate double-membrane vesicles that are generated during coronavirus

136

replication (17, 18). Interestingly, despite reduction of protein-degrading autophagy, we observed

137

strong upregulation of amino acids, especially those linked to glutathione metabolism, which is

138

responsible for elimination of reactive oxygen species (ROS). This might be essential to limit the

139

mitochondrion-derived ROS that are generated during excessive ATP production (19) and should be

140

investigated in future studies. Further investigations should also clarify why the observed upregulated

141

amino acid levels do not activate mTORC1 (see Figure 2, pmTORS2448/mTOR and pULK1S757/ULK1).

142

However, spatially distinct pools of mTORC1 proteins might serve as an explanation (20).

143

Interestingly, putrescine (Figure 3c, red) was increased whereas its downstream products of the

144

polyamine biosynthesis pathway, spermidine and spermine, were strongly reduced. The putrescine

145

increase might be explained by a SARS-CoV-2-induced inhibition of spermidine synthase, the enzyme

146

that synthesizes spermidine from putrescine (Figure 3c, red). Spermidine is an important polyamine

147

capable of inducing autophagy (21) and responsible for hypusination of the eukaryotic translation

148

initiation factor eIF5A (22). eIF5A activates the autophagy transcription factor TFEB and regulates

149

proteins responsible for mitochondrial respiration (23).

150

Next, we targeted different components of the metabolic/autophagic pathway by exogenous

151

administration of selective inhibitors, approved drugs, or cell metabolites, and explored the effect on

152

SARS-CoV-2 propagation (Figure 4). Cell viability tests were performed for inhibitors and drugs to

153

exclude toxicity (Figure S3a). VeroFM cells were infected with an MOI of 0.0005 and treated 1 hour

154

post infection with different concentrations of each substance according to the manual instructions or

155

previous publications. Virus growth was monitored by real-time RT-PCR in cell culture supernatants 24

156

and 48 hours post infection (Figure S3b-d). DFMO (500 µM) blocks ornithine-to-putrescine synthesis

157

(24) and was previously described as an RNA virus inhibitor upon pretreatment (25) but had minor

158

effects on SARS-CoV-2 growth upon post-treatment, whereas spermidine (100 µM) and spermine (100

159

µM) inhibited SARS-CoV-2 propagation by up to 66% (Figure 4a, upper left panel, Figure S3b,c). AICAR

160

(25 µM), a known AMPK activator (26), slightly induced virus growth at 24 hours post infection (Figure

161

4a, upper right panel), which seems contradictory, as AMPK is downregulated upon SARS-CoV-2

162

infection (see Figure 2), but could be explained by AMPK-induced mTORC1 inhibition or AMPK-

163

unrelated functions of AICAR (27). Alternatively, AICAR-dependent AMPK activation might be

164

insufficient to restore autophagic flux (see Figure 1). In addition, mTORC1 inhibition by rapamycin (0.3

165

µM) clearly induced virus growth (Figure 4a, right panel, Figure S3d,e). Rapamycin, which has

166

previously been proposed as a treatment option for COVID-19 (28), possibly enhances the inhibitory

167

effects of SARS-CoV-2 on mTORC1 (see Figure 2) to reduce cellular protein translation, which would

168

serve as an additional explanation for the above-mentioned elevated amino acid levels (see Figure 3c,

169

orange). These results suggest that detailed molecular and functional analyses should be performed

170

for rapamycin before considering its use in clinical trials. The AKT1 inhibitor MK-2206 (1 µM), which is

171

currently being tested in a clinical phase 2 study against breast cancer (29), reduced SARS-CoV-2

172

propagation up to 50% (Figure 4a, lower right, Figure S3d,e). AKT1 blocks mTORC1 inhibitor TSC2 (30)

173

and further supports the suggestion that up-regulation of mTORC1 components has antiviral effects.

174

As AKT1 inhibition results in BECN1 up-regulation and autophagy induction (10, 31), SARS-CoV-2

175

growth inhibition was expected. Direct blocking of the negative BECN1 regulator SPK2 by previously

176

described inhibitors SMIP004, SMIP004-7, valinomycin, and niclosamide (10) showed SARS-CoV-2

177

growth inhibition from 50 (SMIP004, SMIP004-7) to over 99% in case of valinomycin and niclosamide

178

(Figure 4a, lower panel, Figure S3d,e). We further confirmed that the dominant intervention of

179

niclosamide during SARS-CoV-2 infection acts on autophagy induction, as adding BafA1 after

180

niclosamide treatment showed an enhancing effect on the lipidation of LC3B as reflected by

181

comparable LC3B-II/I ratios between mock- and SARS-CoV-2-infected cells (Figure 4b). However, we

182

cannot exclude that the activity of niclosamide as a hydrogen ionophore has additional inhibitory

183

functions, e.g. by blocking endosomal acidification (32), which is important for SARS-CoV-2 entry (6).

184

We further used our in vitro model to explore the possibility of prophylactic treatment with spermidine

185

and niclosamide, which are well-tolerated, clinically applied (33) or FDA-approved (34) compounds,

186

respectively. To assess the efficacy of pretreatment, VeroFM cells were preincubated with spermidine

187

(100 μM) or niclosamide (5 μM) for 24 hours. Cells were infected with SARS-CoV-2 using an MOI of

188

0.05 without further compound treatment and virus growth was monitored in supernatants for 24

189

hours (Figure 4c, Figure S3f). In both cases, SARS-CoV-2 growth was reduced by 70%, suggesting that

190

both compounds exhibit long-lasting antiviral effects, and supporting further investigation into

191

prophylactic use of these compounds. For clinical use, half-maximal inhibitory concentration (IC50) of

192

compounds should be in a non-toxic range and reach adequate plasma levels (35). The IC50 was 149

193

μM (R2 = 0.71) for spermidine, 0.09 μM (R2= 0.95) for MK-2206, and 0.17 μM (R2= 0.63) for niclosamide,

194

based on plaque-forming infectious units (Figure 4c). Maximal inhibition of infectious virus at non-

195

toxic concentrations was identified at 333.3 μM for spermidine (85%), at 3.7 μM for MK-2206 (88%),

196

and at 1.24 μM for niclosamide (>99%). Whereas plasma levels and pharmacokinetics of spermidine

197

are yet to be evaluated, peak plasma concentrations were 0,176 μg/ml (0.43 μM) for MK-2206 (36)

198

and 0.25 to 6.0 μg/ml (0.76-18.35 μM) for niclosamide (37), encouraging use in clinical trials.

199

In summary, our data show that highly pathogenic SARS-CoV-2 reprograms the metabolism of cells

200

and limits AMPK/mTORC1 activation and autophagy. Our mechanistic approach, including metabolism,

201

protein/phosphoprotein analyses and targeted SARS-CoV-2 inhibition assays, identified multiple

202

cellular targets for the development of new and application of already available antiviral compounds.

Figure 1

Fig.1: SARS-CoV-2 decreases lysosomal-autophagosomal fusion. (a,b) SARS-CoV-2 blocks autophagic flux. NCI-H1299 cells
(a) and VeroFM cells (b) were infected with SARS-CoV-2 (MOI = 0.0005) and incubated with bafilomycin A1 (BafA1) or vehicle
(DMSO) for 2 h before samples were harvested at 8 h, 24 h, or 48 h post infection (h p.i.). The ratios of LC3B-II/I were
determined by Western blotting. (c-d) SARS-CoV-2 stabilizes autophagy receptor P62 protein levels. Cells were infected
analogously to (a-b) and harvested at indicated time points p.i. without additional treatment. P62 protein levels were
determined by Western blotting. (e,f) SARS-CoV-2 blocks fusion of autophagosomes (AP) with lysosomes. NCI-H1299 cells
were transfected with tandem fluorescent-tagged LC3B (mRFP and EGFP) and infected with SARS-CoV-2 (MOI = 0.0005).
Twenty-four hours later, cells were fixed and analyzed by fluorescence microscopy. Vesicles with both green and red
fluorescence (APs) and with red fluorescence only (autolysosomes, AL) were counted. In all panels error bars denote standard
error of mean derived from n = 3 biologically independent experiments. Tp < 0.1, *p < 0.05, ***p < 0.001 (two-way ANOVA
in a,b, one-way ANOVA in c,d, t-test in e. Abbreviations: LC3B, microtubule-associated protein 1A/1B light chain 3B; mRFP,
monomeric red fluorescent protein; EGFP, enhanced green fluorescent protein.

Fig.3: SARS-CoV-2 affects key metabolic pathways. (a) Analysis and regulation of significantly altered pathways of mock and
SARS-CoV-2 infected (24 h p.i) VeroFM cells. The f(x)-axis shows the (median) log2 fold change (FC) of all significantly altered
metabolites of the indicated pathway and the –log10 adjusted p-value (false discovery rate (FDR)) is shown on the x-axis. The
size of the circles illustrates the number of significantly changed metabolites in relation to all metabolites of a specific
pathway. N = 4 per group. (b) Volcano plot of metabolome of SARS-CoV-2 infected (24 h.p.i) VeroFM cells. Metabolites with
log2(FC) ≥ 2 and –log10(FDR) ≥ 1.3 were considered significant. N = 4 per group. (c) Analysis of the autophagic pathway and
the involved metabolites: ‘amino acids’ and ´GSH metabolism’ (orange), ‘nucleotides’ (blue), ‘glycolysis/ TCA cycle’ (violet)
and ‘polyamine metabolism’ (red) and ‘AMP/ATP ratio’ (blue) upon mock and SARS-CoV-2 infected (24 h p.i) VeroFM cells.
Error bars represent standard deviations *Adjusted p-value (FDR) ≤ 0.05; **FDR ≤ 0.01; ***FDR ≤ 0.001. N=4 per group.
