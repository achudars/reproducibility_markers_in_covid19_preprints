Abstract

20

An effective response to the ongoing coronavirus disease (COVID-19) pandemic caused by

21

severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) will require a range of

22

complementary preventive modalities. The current studies were conducted to evaluate the in

23

vitro SARS-CoV-2 antiviral activity of astodrimer sodium, a dendrimer with broad spectrum

24

antimicrobial activity, including against enveloped viruses in in vitro and in vivo models, that is

25

marketed for antiviral and antibacterial applications. We report that astodrimer sodium inhibits

26

replication of SARS-CoV-2 in Vero E6 cells when added to cells 1-hour prior to or 1-hour post

27

infection, with 50% effective concentrations reducing virus-induced cytopathic effect (EC50)

28

ranging from 0.090 to 0.742 µM (0.002 to 0.012 mg/mL). The selectivity index (SI) in these

29

assays was as high as 2197. Astodrimer sodium was also effective in a virucidal evaluation when

30

mixed with virus for 1 hour prior to infection of cells (EC50 1.83 µM [0.030 mg/mL]). Results

31

from a time of addition study, which showed infectious virus was below the lower limit of

32

detection at all time points tested, were consistent with the compound inhibiting early virus entry

33

steps. The data were similar for all investigations and were consistent with the potent antiviral

34

activity of astodrimer sodium being due to inhibition of virus-host cell interactions, as previously

35

demonstrated for other viruses. Further studies will confirm if astodrimer sodium binds to SARS-

36

CoV-2 spike protein and physically blocks initial association of the virus with heparan sulfate

37

proteoglycans on the host cell. Given the in vitro effectiveness and significantly high SI,

38

astodrimer sodium warrants further investigation for potential as a nasally administered or

39

inhaled antiviral agent for SARS-CoV-2 prevention and treatment applications.

1. Introduction

43

The ongoing pandemic coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), caused by severe acute

44

respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection, has resulted in unprecedented

45

efforts to rapidly develop strategies to contain infection rates for the protection of vulnerable

46

populations. An effective public health response to the current pandemic will require any vaccine

47

to be supplemented by other alternative preventive modalities.

48

SARS-CoV-2 receptors and coreceptors have been shown to be highly expressed in nasal

49

epithelial cells (Sungnak et al., 2020). This finding is consistent with the virus infectivity or

50

replication pattern along the respiratory tract, which peaks proximally (nasal cavity) and is

51

relatively minimal in the distal alveolar regions (Hou et al., 2020). These findings suggest that

52

nasal carriage of the virus could be a key feature of transmission, and that nasally administered

53

therapeutic modalities could be potentially effective in helping to prevent spread of infection.

54

Astodrimer sodium (SPL7013) is a generation -four lysine dendrimer with a polyanionic surface

55

charge (McCarthy et al., 2005) that is active against several enveloped and non-enveloped

56

viruses including human immunodeficiency virus-1 (HIV-1) (Lackman-Smith et al., 2008,

57

Tyssen et al., 2010), herpes simplex virus (HSV)-1 and -2 (Gong et al., 2005), H1N1 influenza

58

virus, human papillomavirus (HPV), adenovirus and Zika virus (unpublished data). Astodrimer

59

sodium also has antibacterial properties. Both size and surface charge contribute to the function

60

of the compound (Tyssen et al., 2010), and when administered topically, astodrimer sodium is

61

not absorbed systemically (Chen et al., 2009; O’Loughlin et al., 2010; McGowan et al., 2011).

62

Vaginally administered astodrimer sodium protected macaques from infection with chimeric

63

simian-HIV-1 (SHIV)89.6P (Jiang et al., 2005), and mice and guinea pigs from HSV-2 infection

(Bernstein et al., 2003) in vaginal infection challenge models. Astodrimer 1% Gel (10mg/mL

65

astodrimer sodium) administered vaginally has been shown to be safe and effective in phase 2

66

and large phase 3 trials for treatment and prevention of bacterial vaginosis (BV) (Schwebke et

67

al., 2019; Chavoustie et al., 2020; Waldbaum et al., 2020) and is marketed in Europe, Australia,

68

New Zealand and several countries in Asia.

69

The current studies were conducted to assess the antiviral activity of astodrimer sodium against

70

SARS-CoV-2 in vitro, to determine if it has potential as a reformulated, nasally administered or

71

inhaled antiviral agent to help prevent spread of SARS-CoV-2 infection.

72

2. Materials and methods

73

2.1 Virus, cell culture, astodrimer sodium and controls

74

SARS-CoV-2 hCoV-19/Australia/VIC01/2020 was a gift from Melbourne’s Peter Doherty

75

Institute for Infection and Immunity (Melbourne, Australia). Virus stock was generated at

76

360Biolabs (Melbourne, Australia) by two passages in Vero cells in virus growth media, which

77

comprised Minimal Essential Medium (MEM) without L-glutamine supplemented with 1% (w/v)

78

L-glutamine, 1.0 µg/mL of L-(tosylamido-2-phenyl) ethyl chloromethyl ketone (TPCK)-treated

79

trypsin (Worthington Biochemical, NJ, USA), 0.2% bovine serum albumin (BSA) and 1%

80

insulin-transferrin-selenium (ITS).

81

Astodrimer sodium was prepared as 86.29 mg/mL in water and stored at 4°C. Astodrimer

82

sodium has a molecular weight of 16581.57 g/mol and the structure is described and illustrated in

83

Tyssen et al., 2010. The purity of the compound used in these studies was assessed by ultra-high-

84

performance liquid chromatography (UPLC) to be 98.79%.

85

Remdesivir (MedChemExpress, NJ, USA) was used as a positive control in the virus-induced

86

cytopathic effect (CPE) inhibition and time of addition (TOA) assays.

87

Hydroxychloroquine sulfate (Sigma-Aldrich, Sydney, Australia) was used as a positive control in

88

the TOA assay.

89

2.2 Virus-induced cytopathic effect inhibition assay

90

African Green Monkey Kidney (Vero E6, ATCC-CRL1586) cell stocks were generated in cell

91

growth medium, which comprised MEM without L-glutamine supplemented with 10% (v/v)

92

heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum (FBS) and 1% (w/v) L-glutamine. Vero E6 cell

93

monolayers were seeded in 96-well plates at 2x104 cells/well in 100 µL growth medium

94

(MEM supplemented with 1% (w/v) L-glutamine, 2% FBS) and incubated overnight at 37°C

95

in 5% CO2. SARS-CoV-2 infection was established by using a multiplicity of infection (MOI)

96

of 0.05 to infect cell monolayers.

97

Astodrimer sodium or remdesivir were serially diluted 1:3, 9 times and each compound

98

concentration was assessed for both antiviral efficacy and cytotoxicity in triplicate.

99

Astodrimer sodium was added to Vero E6 cells 1 hour prior to infection or 1 hour post-

100

infection with SARS-CoV-2. Cell cultures were incubated at 37°C in 5% CO2 for 4 days prior

101

to assessment of CPE. The virus growth media was MEM supplemented with 1% (w/v) L-

102

glutamine, 2% FBS, and 4 µg/mL TPCK-treated trypsin. On Day 4, viral-induced CPE and

103

cytotoxicity of the compound were determined by measuring the viable cells using the

104

methylthiazolyldiphenyl-tetrazolium bromide (MTT) assay (MP Biomedicals, NSW,

105

Australia). Absorbance was measured at 540-650 nm on a plate reader.

2.3 Virucidal assay

107

Astodrimer sodium was serially diluted 1:3, 9 times and tested in triplicate wells. SARS-CoV-

108

2 was mixed with diluted astodrimer sodium at a MOI of 0.05 and incubated for 1 hour at

109

37°C in 5% CO2. Virus and compound mixture were added to Vero E6 cell monolayers in 96-

110

well plates and incubated at 37°C in 5% CO2 for 4 days. On day 4, the virus-induced CPE was

111

measured by the MTT assay as described above.

112

2.4 Determination of effective concentration (EC50 and EC90) and cytotoxicity (CC50)

113

The concentration of compound that gives a 50% or 90% reduction in viral-induced CPE (EC50

114

or EC90 respectively) was calculated using the formula of Pauwels et al., 1998.

115

The concentration of compound that resulted in a 50% reduction in cell viability (CC50) after

116

4 days of culture was also calculated by the formula of Pauwels et al., 1998.

117

2.5 Time of addition assay (TOA)

118

Vero E6 cell monolayers were grown in MEM supplemented with 1% (w/v) L-glutamine, 2%

119

FBS. To ensure robust infection, cell cultures were infected with SARS-CoV-2 at a MOI of 1.

120

The virus was adsorbed for 1 hour at 4°C, then parallel cultures were warmed to 37°C for 0 min,

121

15 min, 30 min, 60 min, 2 h, 4 h, 6 h prior to adding 0.345 mg/mL astodrimer sodium, 15 µM

122

hydroxychloroquine, 5 µM remdesivir, or negative control (assay media only). For the 0 min

123

time point, test or control articles were added immediately following virus pre-adsorption. Eight

124

hours after virus infection (the duration of one cycle of replication), virus was harvested from the

125

cells for each time point. The supernatant, containing virus, was retained and the virus titer

126

determined for each time point via virus yield assay.

127

2.6 Virus yield reduction assay

128

Virus titer from the TOA study was quantified as a median tissue culture infective dose (TCID50)

129

value. TCID50 is a measure of virus titer and represents the titer of a virus that produces infection

130

in 50% of the tissue culture samples. Vero E6 cells monolayers were grown in MEM

131

supplemented with 1% (w/v) L-glutamine, 2% FBS. Virus harvested from each time point was

132

added to three wells and serially diluted three-fold across the plate for a total of nine different

133

virus concentrations. Six of the wells contained assay media alone (i.e., no virus) and served as

134

controls. Plates were incubated for three days and cell monolayers were then observed

135

microscopically with visual scoring of virus-induced CPE used as an endpoint. The TCID50 of

136

the virus suspension was determined using the method of Reed-Muench, 1938. Virus yield was

137

expressed as a percentage with respect to virus growth when no compound was added, for each

138

time point.

139

3. Results

140

3.1 Virus-induced cytopathic effect inhibition assay

141

In two independent virus-induced CPE inhibition assays, astodrimer sodium inhibited SARS-

142

CoV-2 (hCoV-19/Australia/VIC01/2020) replication in Vero E6 cells in a dose dependent

143

manner (Table 1; Figure 1A, Figure 1B). Astodrimer sodium was active and inhibited viral

144

replication when added either 1 hour prior to infection, or 1 hour post-infection with SARS-

145

CoV-2.

146

Astodrimer sodium was initially tested in the range of 0.0013 to 8.63 mg/mL (0.078 to 520.4

147

µM). In the repeat set of assays, astodrimer sodium was tested in the range of 0.0001 to

148

0.86 mg/mL (0.008 to 52.0 µM) to help further characterize the lower end of the dose response

curve. The effective and cytotoxic concentrations, and selectivity indices from the assays are

150

shown individually and as means in Table 1.

151

The selectivity index (SI) for astodrimer sodium against SARS-CoV-2 ranged from 793 to 2197

152

for the initial assays where compound was added 1 hour prior to infection and 1 hour after

153

infection, respectively, and was >70 to >80 in the repeat assays, in which cytotoxicity was not

154

observed up to the highest concentration tested (0.86 mg/mL).

155

The positive control, remdesivir, was also active in the CPE inhibition assay, with a SI of >33.

156

3.2 Virucidal assay

157

A second study was performed to determine if astodrimer sodium was able to reduce viral

158

infectivity by binding to SARS-CoV-2 directly prior to infection of Vero E6 cells. Astodrimer

159

sodium treatment demonstrated a similar level of antiviral efficacy to the CPE studies (Table 1;

160

Figure 1C) with an EC50 of 1.83 µM (0.030 mg/mL) and SI of 130; n=1.

161

3.3 Time of addition assay (TOA)

162

To further investigate the mechanism of action of astodrimer sodium, a TOA study was

163

performed. Compound was added to virus-infected cells at early, middle and late stages of the

164

SARS-CoV-2 replication lifecycle, which is completed in approximately 8 hours (Ogando et al.,

165

2020). The addition of 0.345 mg/mL astodrimer sodium at times ranging from 0 min to 6 h post-

166

infection resulted in virus levels below the lower limit of detection at every time point (Figure 2).

167

This finding was in contrast to detectable infectious virus levels at all equivalent time points in

168

the positive control (remdesivir and hydroxychloroquine sulfate) and virus only cultures.

169

Hydroxychloroquine sulfate had no discernible effect on virus replication at any time point at 15

µM. Remdesivir (5 µM, ~5-10 times the EC50) inhibited virus replication by <1 log10 TCID50

171

when added within 15 or 30 min post-infection.

172

4. Discussion

173

Astodrimer sodium demonstrated potent antiviral activity against SARS-CoV-2 in Vero E6 cells.

174

The finding of antiviral activity was demonstrated when astodrimer sodium was added to cells or

175

mixed with SARS-CoV-2 prior to infection of cells, when the compound was added to cells

176

already exposed to SARS-CoV-2, and when astodrimer sodium was added at all times

177

throughout the SARS-CoV-2 replication lifecycle to cells already infected with virus.

178

Of note is a significantly high SI for astodrimer sodium relative to other antiviral compounds

179

under investigation for SARS-CoV-2 activity (Pizzorno et al., 2020).

180

Remdesivir was used as the antiviral positive control for the CPE inhibition assays and the

181

experimental EC50 was consistent with published data generated with a different clinical isolate

182

of SARS-CoV-2 (Wang et al., 2020).

183

The antiviral data are consistent with astodrimer sodium being a potent inhibitor of early events

184

in the virus lifecycle. The virucidal assay data suggest that astodrimer sodium antiviral activity

185

was consistent with the proposed mechanism of action of binding to virus, thereby inactivating

186

virus and blocking infection.

187

The complete abolition of virus infection at all time points in the TOA assay are also consistent

188

with astodrimer sodium being a potent antiviral agent that inhibits the early phase of virus

189

infection and replication. These findings suggest potent inhibition of viral attachment, fusion and

190

entry of the virus, which prevents virus replication and release of infectious virus progeny. It is

10
191

possible that potential carryover of compound from the initial cell culture supernatant to the

192

cultures used in the virus-yield reduction assay may have affected the TOA data. Additional

193

studies may further demonstrate the mechanism of action of astodrimer sodium inhibition of

194

SARS-CoV-2 replication.

195

However, astodrimer sodium has been previously found to be an effective antiviral that exerts its

196

inhibition in the early virus-host receptor recognition interactions (Tyssen et al., 2010; Telwatte

197

et al., 2011), and its potential mechanism of action against SARS-CoV-2 is likely to be similar to

198

that identified for other pathogens. Astodrimer sodium was found to bind to HIV-1 by strong

199

electrostatic forces to positively charged clusters of highly conserved amino acids on HIV-1

200

gp120 protein and/or positively charged amino acid regions located between the stems of V1/V2

201

and V3 loops, which are exposed by conformational changes to gp120 after viral binding to the

202

receptor/co-receptor complex (Tyssen et al., 2010; Connell and Lortat-Jacob, 2013).

203

Many viruses utilize negatively charged heparan sulfate proteoglycans (HS) on the cell plasma

204

membrane as an initial means to scan the surface of the cell, and to attach in order to chaperone

205

the virus onto the receptor complex prior to viral entry (Sarrazin et al., 2011; Connell and Lortat-

206

Jacob, 2013). The receptor interactions occur in a sequential manner with virus-HS interactions

207

preceding receptor/co-receptor binding, which combined leads to fusion of the viral envelope

208

and the cell membrane.

209

Data indicate that astodrimer sodium-gp120 interaction may physically block initial HIV-1

210

association with HS and thereby block the subsequent virus-receptor complex functions.

211

Virucidal studies of astodrimer sodium determined that it did not disrupt the HIV-1 particle or

212

cause the loss of gp120 spike protein from the viral surface (Telwatte et al., 2011).

11
213

A recent report by Liu et al., 2020, has described that densely glycosylated trimeric SARS-CoV-

214

2 spike (S) protein subunit S1, which is important for receptor binding, binds to HS. To engage

215

with the angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) receptor, the S protein undergoes a hinge-like

216

conformational change that transiently hides or exposes the determinants of receptor binding

217

(Wrapp et al., 2020). Recent studies have identified the binding of heparin to the receptor

218

binding domain (RBD) of S1 resulting in a conformational change to the S protein (Mycroft-

219

West et al., 2020a, b and c). Mutations in the S protein that are distal from the RBD also impact

220

on viral transmission (Walls et al., 2020; Korber et al., 2020; Yuan et al., 2020). Non-RBD

221

polybasic cleavage sites, including S1/S2 loop (Hoffman et al., 2020a), have been described on

222

SARS-CoV-2 S protein (Qiao and Olvera de la Cruz, 2020) and may also be a site of potential

223

interaction with astodrimer sodium.

224

SARS-CoV-2 utilizes the ACE2 receptor for viral infection of host cells (Hoffmann et al.,

225

2020b). Human CoV-NL63 also utilizes HS and ACE2 as its cellular receptor complex

226

(Milewska et al., 2014). The importance of HS for viral infectivity was also demonstrated for

227

close genetically related pseudo-typed SARS-CoV (Lang et al., 2011). The potential dependence

228

of SARS-CoV-2 on HS for attachment and entry combined with antiviral data from other viruses

229

suggest that negatively charged astodrimer sodium may have antiviral activity against SARS-

230

CoV-2 in vitro by blocking the early virus-receptor recognition events.

231

Astodrimer sodium is a polyanionic dendrimer currently being reformulated for potential use as a

232

topical, nasally administered antiviral agent to help prevent acquisition and transmission of

233

SARS-CoV-2 infection. The potential advantages of astodrimer sodium over other technologies

234

include its lack of systemic absorption following topical application (Chen et al., 2009;

235

O’Loughlin et al., 2010; McGowan et al., 2011). In addition, the SI of astodrimer sodium for

12
236

SARS-CoV-2 is high and in a vaginal gel formulation (10 mg/mL), the compound has been

237

shown to be safe and effective in phase 2 and large phase 3 trials for treatment and prevention of

238

BV (Schwebke et al., 2019; Chavoustie et al., 2020; Waldbaum et al., 2020) and is now marketed

239

in Europe, Australia, New Zealand and several countries in Asia. Astodrimer sodium is also the

240

active antiviral substance in VivaGel® condom products that have marketing authorization in

241

Europe, Japan, Australia/New Zealand and Canada. However, these current formulations are not

242

appropriate for use to protect the respiratory tract from SARS-CoV-2 infection.

243

5. Conclusions

244

These data from the current studies, taken together with studies of astodrimer sodium antiviral

245

activity against HIV-1 and HSV-1 and -2, indicate that the compound exerts its antiviral activity

246

against SARS-CoV-2 by interfering with the early virus-cell recognition events. When applied

247

1 hour post-infection through 6 hours post-infection, astodrimer sodium may prevent early virus

248

entry steps such as attachment, thereby reducing or preventing viral infection or cell-cell spread.

249

In the absence of universally effective antiviral agents and/or vaccines against SARS-CoV-2,

250

there is a need to develop a preventive therapy that could be used to significantly reduce the

251

transmission of the virus. An antiviral agent such as astodrimer sodium that blocks binding of the

252

virus to target cells could potentially be used as a preventive and/or a therapeutic agent. These

253

antiviral studies suggest that a reformulation of astodrimer sodium for delivery to the respiratory

254

tract may be an effective preventive strategy to block SARS-CoV-2 transmission and augment

255

other protective and therapeutic strategies.

256

The potent antiviral activity of astodrimer sodium against SARS-CoV-2 warrants further

257

investigation.

275

(15 µM; green) and SARS-CoV-2 (hCoV-19/Australia/VIC01/2020) only (black) were assessed

276

for antiviral activity at early middle and late stages of virus replication by adding compounds at

277

different times post-infection (0 min, 15 min, 30 min, 1 h, 2 h, 4 h, and 6 h). The amount of virus

278

secreted into the supernatant at 8 hours post-infection was determined by TCID50. Each point on

279

the graph represents the virus titer present after one cycle of replication following addition of

280

compound at the indicated time following virus infection. Infectious virus titer for astodrimer

281

sodium was below the lower limit of detection (LLOD) at all time points.
