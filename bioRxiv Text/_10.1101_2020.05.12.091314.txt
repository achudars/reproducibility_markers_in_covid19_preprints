Abstract

The COVID-19 pandemic resulting from the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARSCoV-2) which emerged in December 2019 in the Chinese city of Wuhan in the province Hubei has
placed immense burden on national economies and global health. At present neither vaccination nor
therapies are available although several antiviral agents such as remdesivir, originally an Ebola drug,
nelfinavir, an HIV-1 protease inhibitor and other drugs such as lopinavir have been evaluated. Here, we
performed a meta-analysis of RNA-sequencing data from three studies employing human lung
epithelial cells. Of these one focused on lung epithelial cells infected with SARS-CoV-2. We aimed at
identifying genes co-expressed with angiotensin I converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) the human cell entry
receptor of SARS-CoV-2, and unveiled several genes correlated or inversely correlated with high
significance, among the most significant of these was the transmembrane serine protease 4
(TMPRSS4). Serine proteases are known to be involved in the infection process by priming the virus
spike protein. Pathway analysis revealed papilloma virus infection amongst the most significantly

correlated pathways. Gene Ontologies revealed regulation of viral life cycle, immune responses, proinflammatory responses- several interleukins such as IL6, IL1, IL20 and IL33, IFI16 regulating the
interferon response to a virus, chemo-attraction of macrophages, last and not least cellular stress
resulting from activated Reactive Oxygen Species. We believe that this dataset will aid in a better
understanding of the molecular mechanism(s) underlying COVID-19.

Introduction

Severe acute respiratory disease COVID-19 is a result of infections with the coronavirus SARS-CoV-2
first reported in the Chinese city Wuhan, Province Hubei, in December 2019 and has since 11 March
2020 been designated as a pandemic by WHO. The origin of the virus is still under investigation
although some studies suggest that it was transferred from another species, possibly pangolins1 or bats
2

. At the end of April 2020 the number of globally confirmed cases of COVID-19 exceeded 3 million

and recorded deaths beyond 200,000 in the real-time statistics of the Johns Hopkins University3. Due to
many unreported and asymptomatic cases, the infection fatality rate (IFR) is difficult to determine
however Verity et al. estimate approximately 0.66% (0·39–1·33) in China4. The age-associated IFR is
approximately 7.8% for those above 80 years4. Drugs have been repurposed for stabilizing COVID-19,
but these are not effective therapies5, examples include such as remdesivir (Ebola)6,7, hydroxychloroquine (Malaria)6,7 and nelfinavir (HIV)8 . Another treatment option is to indirectly immunize
individuals with plasma from convalescent COVID-19 patients9. Further approaches aim at mimicking
the human virus cell entry receptor ACE22 with human recombinant soluble ACE2 (hrsACE2)10. The
cell entry receptor ACE2 associates with transmembrane proteases which prime the spike protein of the
virus. Hoffmann et al. assigned this task to the protein TMPRSS211 which they identified in the
predecessor virus SARS-CoV-2 and assume it is the same for SARS-CoV-2. The protease can be
inhibited by existing compounds to interrupt further propagation of the virus in the human host.

Here, we describe a meta-analysis focussing on the transcriptome data from human lung epithelial cells
including samples infected with SARS-CoV-2 from a study described by Blanco Melo et al.12. We
directed the exploration to co-expression with the known CoV-2 receptor ACE2. The analysis revealed
a signature consisting of 72 genes significantly co-expressed with ACE2 either with positive or
negative Pearson correlation. Of the transmembrane serine proteases, the most significantly coexpressed with ACE2 was TMPRSS4, suggesting it to be a putative druggable target.

Results

Cluster analysis of SARS-CoV-2 infected cells compared to other non-infected lung cells
Figure 1 shows a hierarchical cluster analysis of all samples used in this meta-analysis. SARS004 cells
infected with CoV-2 cluster together with mock-infected SARS004 cells but separated from all other
lung epithelial cells and lung carcinoma cell lines which together we consider as control in this
analysis. The table of Pearson correlation co-efficients (suppl. Table 2) reflects the grouping implicated
by the hierarchical clustering: SARS-CoV-2 samples have highest correlation (r=0.9884-0.9936) to the
mock-infected SARS cells.

Analysis of genes with correlated and anti-correlated expression with ACE2
Building on the knowledge about ACE2 as receptor of the SARS-CoV-2 virus we set out to indentify
genes with highly correlated expression with ACE2 with the aim of elucidating the molecular
mechanisms underlying COVID-19. Figure 2 shows the genes most significantly (Bonferoni-adjusted p
< 1E-11) correlated (red to yellow in last column) or anti-correlated (green) with ACE2 (full table in
suppl. Table 3). The transmembrane serine protease 4 (TMPRSS4) is one of the most significantly
correlated (r=0.9142, p=4.59E-20) with ACE2 therefore implying a major role in priming the CoV-2

spike protein. CXCL17 (r=0.9273, p=1.1E-21), ABCA12 (r=0.9256, p=1-92E-21) and ATP10B
(r=0.9193, p=1.14E-20) had marginally higher correlation with ACE2 while another transmembrane
protease TMPRS11E (r=0.9121, p=7.91E-20) had a slightly lower correlation. The expression of
CXCL17 is probably due to a reaction on the infection by chemo-attracting macrophages13. A The role
of ATP binding cassette subfamily A member 12 (ABCA12) is not fully elucidated with respect to
COVID-19 but assumed to transport lipid via lipid granules to the intracellular space and transporting
specific proteases – in the case of harlequin ichtyosis associated with desquamation14. Current
knowledge on ATP10B is scarce. However, Wilk et al. (Table 3 in their publication) report Atp10b gene
expression levels as highly inversely (negative) correlated with influenza gene expression changes in
infected C57BL/6J mice15. In Figure 3a a cluster analysis and gene expression heatmap of the 72 most
significantly (Bonferoni-adjusted p < 1E-11) correlated and anti-correlated genes with ACE2 shows
close clustering of the serine protease TMPRSS4 with ACE2. Also in this analysis of 72 genes SARSCoV-2 (red color bar) cluster together with mock-infected SARS lung epithelial cells separated from
the other lung cells (blue color bar indicates control). In the heatmap presented in Figure 3b, TMPRSS
family members TMPRSS11D/E and TMPRSS4 show close clustering with ACE2 but also TMPRSS2
and TMPRSS13 have similar expression in all experiments, especially in the SARS-CoV-2 infected
samples.

Pathway analysis of genes co-regulated with ACE2
In order to investigate the functionality of genes interacting with ACE2 we filtered genes correlated
with ACE2 by Bonferoni-adjusted p-value < 0.05 and Pearson correlation coefficient > 0.6. 1891 genes
fulfilled these criteria and were subjected to over-representation analysis of KEGG pathways16 . The
most significantly overrepresented pathways associated with the 1891 genes correlated with ACE2
(Figure 4a, suppl. Table 4) are for example, Bacterial invasion of epithelial cells (q=4.4E-06), Human
papillomavirus infection (q=0.0006), Transcriptional misregulation in cancer (q=0.0006) and

Endocytosis (q=0.002). This reflects the mechanisms of virus infection via invasion of epithelial cells
and endocytosis.

Pathway analysis of genes anti-correlated with ACE2
Analogously to the positively correlated genes we also examined the negatively correlated genes with
ACE2 by filtering for Bonferoni-adjusted p-value < 0.05 and Pearson correlation coefficient < -0.6.
1993 genes passed these filtering criteria and were subjected to over-representation analysis of KEGG
pathways15. The most significantly over-represented pathways in the 1993 genes negatively correlated
with ACE2 (Figure 4b, suppl. Table 5) are DNA replication (q=1E-12), Metabolic pathways
(q=1.86E.08), Cell cycle (q=1.1E-05), Fanconi anemia pathway (q=1.24E-05), Mismatch repair
(q=9.89E-05) and Homologouos recombination (q=0.0046). Many of these pathways are associated
with DNA processing or repair. That these are over-represented in genes down-regulated upon infection
with CoV-2 is in line with reports about interferon and interferon stimulated genes (ISGs) inhibiting
virus replication17. This would be a defense against the attempts of the virus to recruit the host’s DNA
repair and homologous recombination mechanisms 18 .

GO analysis of genes co-regulated with ACE2
We furthermore assessed the GOs over-represented in the 1891 genes positively and the 1993 genes
negatively correlated with ACE2. Table 2 shows a selection of significant GOs from all three categories
Biological Process (BP, Figure 5a), Cellular Component (CC) and Molecular Function (MF), suppl.
Table 6 provides the full table and suppl. Table 7 provides the full table for the 1993 genes negatively
correlated with ACE2. Amongst the GO-BPs, metabolic processes are the most significant. GO-BP
terms such as Interspecies interaction between organisms, Cytokine production and positive regulation
of viral process reflect activated mechanisms post-viral infection. Interestingly, we found regulation of
coagulation amongst the GO-BPs what may help elucidate reports about co-agulation in acro-ischemic

COVID-19 patients19. In the GO-CCs, the terms intracellular and membrane-bounded organelle are
most significant. In the GO-MFs, the terms metal ion binding and protein binding emerge as most
significant due probably reflecting the binding of the virus proteins to the host cells. For the full gene
lists associated with these terms refer to suppl. Tables 5 and 6.

Immune system associated GOs co-regulated with ACE2
Table 3 and Figure 5b show GOs (all Biological Processes) related to the immune system overrepresented in genes correlated with ACE2. Myeloid cells involved in the immune response
(GO:0002275, p=5E-07) as well as T-cells (GO:0050870, p=0.02) are activated. Chemokines, in
particular interleukin-1 are produced (GO:0032642, p=0.0049, GO:0032652, p=0.0049) also IL33 and
TNF. Additionally, positive regulation of the innate immune response was prominent (GO:0045089,
p=0.0079). CXCL17 was the gene with the highest correlation with ACE2 and is involved in immune
system process - as described above by chemo-attracting macrophages13. Among the most significantly
ACE2-correlated genes was IFI16 which is associated with several immune system GOs and known as
regulator of the interferon response to viruses20 and will be described in more detail in the next section
about Protein interaction networks. Also in the protein interaction network of the most significantly
ACE2-correlated genes was the interleukin 20 receptor B (IL20RB) which appeared in several GOs
listed in Table 3. With respect to viruses, there is meagre knowledge on IL20RB, however a study
reported over-expression in the pneumonia causing avian influenza A H7N9 virus21.

GOs associated with inflammation and reactive oxygen species (ROS) amongst genes co-regulated with
ACE2
Table 4 and Figure 5c show GOs (all Biological Processes) related to inflammation and ROS overrepresented in genes correlated with ACE2. The GO, positive regulation of inflammatory response
(p=0.0039) would imply that an inflammatory process is induced which finally leads to apoptosis - as

demonstrated by the GO inflammatory cell apoptotic process (p=0.042). The virus receptor ACE2 is
involved in the positive regulation of reactive oxygen species metabolic process (p=0.0185). Induction
of ROS by a respiratory virus and subsequent inflammation has been reported Jamaluddin et al.22 .

Protein interaction networks
We further restricted the set of ACE2-correlated or -anti-correlated genes by drastically filtering with
Bonferoni-adjusted p < 1E-11 in order to construct a human readable protein interaction network of the
most significant proteins (Figure 6). The protein interaction network generated from correlated and
anti-correlated genes with ACE2 shows IFI16 (r=0.8719), LIMA1 (r=0.8955), CNNM3 (r=-0.8732),
HNF4A (r=-0.8750), TRAF3IP2 (r=0.8816), ASB2 (r=0.8791) and FANCC (r=-0.8682) as hub genes
(interactors from the BioGrid database are marked in red, original ACE2-correlated/anti-correlated
genes are marked in green, hub genes and ACE2 are highlighted with yellow shading ). Interferon plays
a major role in the host response to a virus and Thompson et al. reported that IFI16 – one of the hub
genes in our network - controls the interferon response to DNA and RNA viruses20. Lin and Richardson
review that LIMA1 (formerly EPLIN) – which is known to enhance bundling of actin filaments23 mediates the interaction between Cadherins and Actin in the context of adherens junctions - playing a
role in measles virus infection - via trans-binding with molecular interactors on adjacent cells24. In line
with that LIMA1 is connected with E-cadherin (CDH1) in the network and also cadherin 13 (CDH13)
is part of it and among the most significantly correlated genes to ACE2. The connection of ACE2 to
calmodulin 1 (CALM1) is based on a publication by Lambert et al.25 in which they show that CALM1
interacts with the corona virus receptor ACE2 and inhibits shedding of its ectodomain25. CALM1
inhibitors in turn can revert this process so that the ACE2 ectodomain is shed partially mediated by a
metalloproteinase25. The direct connection between CALM1 and LIMA1 was found in a large-scale

interactome study26. The involvement of the hub gene Fanconi anemia complementation group C
(FANCC), although not experimentally proven, might reflect recruitment of DNA repair and
homologous recombination mechanisms from the host by the virus.

Role of TMPRSS4 and other TMPRSS gene family members
A pivotal result of this meta-analysis is the transmembrane serine protease TMPRSS4 which was one
of the most significantly correlated genes with ACE2. Additionally TMPRSS11E (r=0.9121, Bonferonicorrected p=1.09E-15) and TMPRS11D (r=0.9018, Bonferoni-corrected p=1.32E-14) from the same
gene family were found more significant than TMPRSS2 which however was still significantly
correlated with ACE2 (r=0.767, Bonferoni-corrected p=1.79E-6). The assignment of the SARS-CoV-2
spike protein priming functionality to TMPRSS2 was based on the assumption that it would be the
same as for its predecessor SARS-CoV 11. However, this assumption must not necessarily hold true.
See the heatmap in Figure 3b which illustrates expression of transmembrane serine proteases. The
highly significant co-expression of TMPRSS4 with ACE2 and its relevant role as transmembrane serine
protease has enabled us to hypothesize that TMPRSS4 might also be involved in priming the SARSCoV-2 spike protein. We therefore anticipate that inhibitors of TMPRSS4, TMPRS11D and
TMPRS11E - besides those for TMPRSS2 - could be a promising subject of further research.

Discussion

In this meta-analysis we compared RNA-seq data of lung cells infected with SARS-CoV-2 and other
lung cells with particular focus on correlated gene expression with the known SARS-CoV-2 receptor
gene ACE2. We found a signature of genes positively or negatively correlated with ACE2 amongst

which the most outstanding was the transmembrane serine protease TMPRSS4. In a recent publication
Hoffmann et al11. inferred from the knowledge that the preceding virus SARS-CoV uses ACE2 as
receptor for entry and the serine protease TMPRSS2 for spike protein priming that the new virus
SARS-CoV-2 11 would do the same. While the involvement of the receptor ACE2 appears to be
established1,10 the use of TMPRSS2 for spike protein priming appears not fully settled as Hoffmann et
al. still have to concede “that SARS-CoV-2 infection of Calu-3 cells was inhibited but not abrogated by
camostat mesylate” (serine protease inhibitor with activity against TMPRSS2)11. The high significance
(r=0.9142, p=4.59E-20) in our co-expression analysis with ACE2 suggests that TMPRSS4 is a
considerable candidate for spike protein priming. However, TMPRSS4 is closely related to TMPRSS2
which both can proteolytically cleave the hemagglutinin of influenza viruses27. Further transmembrane
serine proteases TMPRS11D (r=0.9018, p=9.61E-19) and TMPRS11E (r=0.9121, p=7.91E-20) in our
analysis also emerged more significant than TMPRSS2 (r=0.767, p=1.3E-10). The TMPRS11 family
member TMPRS11A was found to enhance viral infection with the first coronavirus SARS-CoV by
spike protein cleavage in the airway28. Thus, we should not exclude the probability that other members
of the TMPRSS gene family may be proteases for the SARS-CoV2 spike protein. TMPRSS2 inhibitors
have been proposed by Hoffmann et al.11 - and earlier for the SARS-Cov virus by Kawase et al.29 as
working best together with cathepsin B/L inhibitors. We propose to investigate the effect of TMPRSS4
inhibitors in further research. As TMPRSS4 has been implicated in the invasion and metastasis of
several cancers it has been also considered as target for cancer therapy for which a modest inhibitory
effect of the above mentioned inhibitors in TMPRSS4-overexpressing SW480 cells was reported 30.
Interestingly, also TMPRSS2 is connected to epithelial carcinogenesis as consistently overexpressed in
prostate cancer 31, and later a gene fusion of TMPRSS2 and ERG was reported as the predominant
molecular subtype of prostate cancer 32, where TMPRSS2 however only contributes untranslated
sequence33. Assuming that co-expression with ACE2 is an indication that TMPRSS4 may prime the
SARS-CoV2 spike protein we suggest that further development and testing of more effective

TMPRSS4 inhibitors in in vitro and in vivo models could support the translation into clinical settings.
However, we have to state the limitation that this study is a meta-analysis based solely on transcriptome
and not proteome data.

Besides the identification of TMPRSS4, we found several significantly over-represented GOs and
pathways such as Endocytosis, Papilloma virus infection and Bacterial invasion of epithelial cells for
which we provide full gene lists to foster further elucidation of disease mechanisms. Genes from the
constructed protein interaction network provide a first snapshot of a comprehensive image: IFI16
controls the interferon response to the virus20, LIMA1 mediating the interaction between Cadherins
(CDH1, CDH13) and Actin in the context of adherens junctions potentially playing a role in virus
infection, CALM1 inhibits shedding of the ectodomain of the virus receptor ACE2 25 .

Furthermore, GO analyses revealed several biological processes related to viral cell entry, host reaction,
immune response, ROS, inflammation and apoptosis. This led us to propose a cascade of events taking
place post SARS-CoV-2 entry into host cells- illustrated in Figure 7 together with possible drug targets.
The coronavirus SARS-CoV-2 docks at the receptor ACE2 on the membrane of the human epithelial
cell, the early stage of infection. According to reports by Monteil et al. these processes can be blocked
with recombinant hrsACE210. Transmembrane serine proteases TMPRSS2 mediate SARS-CoV-2 cell
entry via ACE211,34. TMPRSS2 has been described as a mediator of ACE2-coupled endocytosis in the
first SARS-CoV 35 and by previous publication also for SARS-CoV211. However, we identified high
levels of co-expression between ACE2 and TMPRSS4 and other members of the TMPRSS family and
hypothesize that any of these additional family members might have the same function as the well
described TMPRSS2. As a consequence, we propose that besides TMPRSS2 also other TMPRSS
family members could be targets of pharmaceutical intervention warranting further research. After
entering the cell, SARS-CoV-2 RNA is released, replicated and packaged again. Drugs can target the

viral protease and the polymerase needed for replication36. Replication can further be inhibited by
interferon and interferon-stimulated genes (ISG)17which we also found evidence for in negatively
correlated replication pathways (e.g. DNA replication and homologous recombination). This depends
on a healthy immune response and may be impaired in individuals with a weak immune system due to
age or underlying diseases. The virus is packaged and released into the extracellular space where it can
be attacked by macrophages chemo-attracted by CXCL1713. Also T-Cells can be involved in the
immune response. We found evidence for their activation in GO analysis by associated interleukins IL1
and IL7. It is tempting to speculate that the severity of the clinical manifestations such as the acute
respiratory failure and also failure in other organs depend on the state of the immune system which
decreases with age or diseases such as diabetes. The involvement of ACE2 in the renin-angiotensin
system as antagonist of ACE in regulating blood pressure via Angiotensin II, vasoconstriction, dilation
and its protective role against lung injury 37 are additional factors which correlate with age. This is
confirmed by reports from Wadmann et al.38 about Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC)
data from 14 U.S. states that 50% hospitalized COVID-19 patients had pre-existing high blood
pressure38. In their study about ACE2 in the preceeding SARS-CoV virus Imai et al. 37 found that
ACE2 protects against lung injury and acid-induced lung injury in a Ace2-knockout mouse can be
improved by an inhibitor of the Angiotensin II receptor AT137 . The results of clinical studies but also
statistics on hypertension and even more important statistics on pharmacological treatment of
hypertension in COVID-19 patients may shed light on the discussions if treatment with ACE inhibitors
and angiotensin receptor blockers (ARBs) are detrimental39 or beneficial40.

We conclude, that our meta-analysis of RNA-Seq data of lung cells partially infected with SARS-CoV2 identified the transmembrane serine protease TMPRSS4 as one of the most significantly correlated
genes with the virus receptor ACE2. We propose that inhibitors of TMPRSS family members
TMPRSS4, TMPRSS11D and TMPRSS11E besides TMPRSS2 are worthwhile testing in vitro and if

that turns out to be successful and toxicity can be excluded potentially for in vivo studies. As clinicians,
pathologists and scientists are struggling to get to grips with and understanding of the damage wrought
by SARS-CoV-2 as it invades the body, we hope that our analyses and dataset will contribute to a better
understanding of the molecular basis of COVID-19.

Methods

Sample collection of lung cell RNA-Seq data
Next-generation sequencing datasets measured in RNA-Seq experiments with lung cells (GSE147507:
Illumina NextSeq 500; GSE146482: Illumina NovaSeq 6000; GSE85121: Illumina HiSeq 2500) were
downloaded from NCBI GEO (Table 1, suppl. Table 1). These datasets were provided along with
studies by Blanco-Melo et al.12 (GSE147507) and Staudt et al.41 (GSE85121). A final publication
related to the dataset GSE146482 is yet to materialize. From accession no. GSE85121 only small
airway epithelium brushing cells were used but alveolar macrophages were excluded while from
accession no. GSE147507 only human epithelial and adenocarcinoma lung cells were used but ferret
cells and updates after March 24 were excluded and from accession no. GSE146482 only control
epithelial cells were used but graphene oxide treated cells were excluded. After exclusion of the above
mentioned datasets not fitting the target cell type, 49 samples remained useful.

Data normalization and analysis
After the excluded samples had been filtered from the downloaded RNA-Seq data data was imported
into the R/Bioconductor environment42. Read counts from accesion nos. GSE147507 and GSE146482

were converted to FPKM (fragments per kilobase of exon model per million reads mapped) using
trancript lengths downloaded from ENSEMBL (version GRCh38, p13). Batch effects were removed
with the package sva43 employing method ComBat44. Normalization was performed via the voom
method45. Pearson correlation coefficients between samples were calculated with the R-builtin method
cor. Dendrograms were drawn employing the dendextend package46 filtering genes for high coefficient
of variation above the 75% quantile.

Detection of genes correlated with ACE2
The Pearson correlation of the normalized gene expression values for all samples was calculated
between the gene ACE2 and each other gene. The method cor.test was applied to calculate the p-value
for the t-test for Pearson correlation. The p-value was Bonferoni-corrected by division by the number
of genes and additionally adjusted via the Benjamini-Hochberg method47. Correlated genes were
filtered with a very restrictive criterion (Bonferoni-adjusted-p < 1E-11) - in order to get human readable
numbers of genes for heatmap and network generation- and conventional criteria (r > 0.6, Bonferoniadjuste-p < 0.05) for positively correlated genes and (r < 0.6, Bonferoni-adjusted-p < 0.05) for
negatively correlated genes.

Pathway and gene ontology (GO) analysis
The R package GOstats48 was employed for over-representation analysis of positively and negatively
correlated genes with the CoV-2 receptor gene ACE2. KEGG pathway annotations which had been
downloaded from the KEGG database16 in March 2018 were used for testing overrepresentation of the
positively and negatively ACE2-correlated genes via the R-builtin hypergeometric test.
Dot plots showing the p-value of the hypergeometric test, the ratio of significant genes to all genes in
the pathway and the number of significant genes per pathway were plotted via the package ggplot249.

Protein interaction networks
A human protein interaction network was constructed in a similar manner as we described in our
previous publication50. However, here only direct interactors and no further interactors of interactors
were extracted from the Biogrid database version 3.4.16151 using the restrictively filtered (Bonferoniadjusted-p < 1E-11) genes significantly correlated or anti-correlated with ACE2 gene expression. The
network was reduced to the n=30 nodes with most interactions and was plotted via the R package
network 52 showing original genes in green and BioGrid-derived interactors in red.

Figure 2: Most significantly (Bonferoni-adjusted p < 1E-11) correlated (red to yellow in last column) or
anti-correlated (green) genes with ACE2. The transmembrane serine protease 4 (TMPRSS4) is one of
the most significantly correlated (r=0.9142, p=4.59E-20) with ACE2 suggesting a major role in priming
the CoV2 spike protein. CXCL17 (r=0.9273, p=1.1E-21), ABCA12 (r=0.9256, p=1-92E-21) and
ATP10B (r=0.9193, p=1.14E-20) had marginally higher correlation with ACE2 while another
transmembrane protease TMPRS11E (r=0.9121, p=7.91E-20) had slightly lower correlation.

Figure 3: (a) Cluster analysis and gene expression heatmap of 72 most significantly (Bonferoniser

TMPRSS11D/E and TMPRSS4 with ACE2 but also TMPRSS2 and TMPRSS13 have similar

expression, particularly in SARS-CoV-2 infected samples. The red color bar indicates SARS-CoV-2,
blue color bar control.

Figure 4: (a) The five most significantly overrepresented pathways correlated with ACE2 are Human
papillomavirus infection, Bacterial invasion of epithelial cells, Endocytosis, Axon Guidance and
Transcriptional mis-regulation in cancer. (b) The six most significantly overrepresented pathways anticorrelated with ACE2 are DNA replication, Metabolic pathways, Cell cycle, Fanconi anemia pathway,
Mismatch repair and Homologous recombination. Many of these pathways are associated with DNA
processing or repair. That these are down-regulated upon infection with CoV-2 is in line with reports
about interferon and interferon stimulated genes (ISGs) inhibiting virus replication16. This would be a
defense against the attempts of the virus to recruit the host’s DNA repair and homologous
recombination mechanisms as Gillespie et al. report18.

ACE2 on the membrane of the human epithelial cell. Transmembrane serine proteases TMPRSSx
a
mediate SARS-CoV-2 cell entry via ACE2. TMPRSS2 was reported for this in the first SARS-CoV and
by previous publication also for SARS-CoV-2 but we hypothesize that due to co-expression with
ACE2, TMPRSS4 and other members of the TMPRSS family may well perform this task. We sugges
gest
that inhibitors of TMPRSS4 and other TMPRSS family members might have therapeutic potential.
Upon entry into the cell, viral RNA is released, replicated and packaged again. Replication can be
inhibited by interferon and interferon stimulated genes (ISG) what we also saw in negatively correlat
lated
replication pathways (e.g. DNA replication and homologous recombination). This indicates a healthy
thy
immune response and may be impaired in persons with a weak immune system due to age or disease
se.
The packaged virus is released from the cell and can be attacked by macrophages chemo-attracted by
CXCL17 - or T-cells for which we found evidence for by GO analysis and by associated interleukins
ins
IL1 and IL7. It is tempting to speculate that the severity of the clinical manifestations such as the acu
cute
respiratory failure and also failure in other organs depends on the quality of the immune system
decreasing with age or diseases such as diabetes. The involvement of ACE2 in the renin-angiotensin
in
system as antagonist of ACE in regulating blood pressure via Angiotensin II (Ang-II), vasoconstrictio
ction,
dilation and its protective role against lung injury are additional factors which correlate with age.
