Abstract

27

Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), a causative

28

agent of COVID-19 pandemic, enters host cells via the interaction of its Receptor-Binding

29

Domain (RBD) of Spike protein with host Angiotensin-Converting Enzyme 2 (ACE2).

30

Therefore, RBD is a promising vaccine target to induce protective immunity against

31

SARS-CoV-2 infection. In this study, we report the development of RBD protein-based

32

vaccine candidate against SARS-CoV-2 using self-assembling H. pylori-bullfrog ferritin

33

nanoparticles as an antigen delivery. RBD-ferritin protein purified from mammalian cells

34

efficiently assembled into 24-mer nanoparticles. 16-20 months-old ferrets were

35

vaccinated with RBD-ferritin nanoparticles (RBD-nanoparticles) by intramuscular or

36

intranasal inoculation. All vaccinated ferrets with RBD-nanoparticles produced potent

37

neutralizing antibodies against SARS-CoV-2. Strikingly, vaccinated ferrets demonstrated

38

efficient protection from SARS-CoV-2 challenge, showing no fever, body weight loss and

39

clinical symptoms. Furthermore, vaccinated ferrets showed rapid clearance of infectious

40

viruses in nasal washes and lungs as well as viral RNA in respiratory organs. This study

41

demonstrates the Spike RBD-nanoparticle as an effective protein vaccine candidate

42

against SARS-CoV-2.

Introduction

44

SARS-CoV-2, originally named 2019-nCoV upon initial isolation from Wuhan, China in

45

December 2019, has caused a global outbreak of coronavirus disease-19 (COVID-19) with

46

significant socioeconomic impacts (1, 2). From the continuously growing numbers of diagnoses

47

and deaths, COVID-19 was declared a public health emergency of international concern

48

(PHEIC) in January 2020 and soon declared a pandemic by WHO in March 2020 (3, 4). As of

49

Jan 27th 2021, more than 100 million people have been infected with SARS-CoV-2, among

50

which 2 million died (5). Although approximately 80% of the confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infections

51

are asymptomatic or show mild flu-like symptoms, 20% of the infections progress to severe

52

pneumonia and acute respiratory distress syndrome requiring hospitalization and mechanical

53

ventilation (6, 7). The overwhelming number of SARS-CoV-2 patients has rapidly devastated the

54

availability of health-care resources (8). Shortage of medical resources and staff in conjunction

55

with the overwhelming number of patients have exacerbated the quality of medical care and

56

eventually increased mortality rates of COVID-19 (9). Although a significant proportion of the

57

infected patients have recovered, many of them report cardiovascular, pulmonary, and

58

neurologic symptoms lasting after the recovery (10, 11). Thus, strong preventive measures are

59

essential to halt the pandemic and its destructive effects on the global public health, as well as

60

the economy.

61

SARS-CoV-2 is a member of the Coronaviridae family, carrying a single positive-

62

stranded RNA genome within the viral envelope (2). Although at least seven coronaviruses are

63

known as etiological agents of mild respiratory illnesses in human infection, the family has not

64

been closely associated with severe illnesses until the relatively recent outbreaks of SARS-CoV,

65

MERS-CoV, and SARS-CoV-2 (1, 12). Emergence of these pathogens and the COVID-19

66

pandemic have called for an urgent global research efforts to investigate the pathogenesis of

67

coronaviruses. The SARS-CoV-2 RNA genome is approximately 30 kilobases and encodes for

68

structural proteins such as –Spike (S), Envelope (E), Membrane (M), and Nucleocapsid (N)–

69

and non-structural proteins such as papain-like protease, chymotrypsin-like protease, and RNA-

70

dependent RNA polymerase (13). The heavily glycosylated S protein protruding from the virion

71

surface is the key bridge between the virus and the host cell, playing a crucial role in host cell

72

receptor recognition, virion attachment, and ultimately entry into the host cell. S is a member of

73

the Class I viral fusion protein which undergoes trimerization upon cleavage into S1 and S2

74

domains by a host cellular protease, furin. While S1 confers specificity in cell tropism through its

75

Receptor-Binding Domain (RBD) which directly interacts with the receptor of SARS-CoV-2,

76

Angiotensin-Converting Enzyme 2 (ACE2), S2 mediates membrane fusion via formation of a

77

trimeric hairpin structure from its heptad repeat domains (14). Therefore, S1 RBD has been

78

considered as one of the most promising candidates in vaccine development to protect against

79

Coronaviruses (15-17). Its efficacy has previously been shown to induce potent neutralizing

80

antibodies against MERS-CoV (18). Furthermore, previous studies of neutralizing antibodies

81

from naturally recovered patients of SARS-CoV-2 infections have mapped their epitopes to be

82

S1 and RBD (19, 20), implicating RBD-targeting antibodies in successful immunity against

83

SARS-CoV-2 (21-23). Thus, most of the currently developed vaccines against SARS-CoV-2,–

84

despite of their diversity in vaccine approaches,– include RBD in their immunogens (24-28).

85

One major limitation of small soluble proteins alone as vaccine candidates is that our

86

immune system only reacts efficiently against immunogens of nanometer range in size (29, 30).

87

Therefore, many protein vaccines using viral proteins are developed into virus-like particles

88

(VLPs) which are multiprotein structures that mimic the organization and conformation of native

89

viruses, but lack the viral genome. However, this approach is limited to a few pathogens that are

90

capable of self-assembling into VLPs upon overexpression of the viral protein, such as Hepatitis

91

B virus (HBV) surface antigen (HBsAg) and Human Papillomavirus (HPV) L1 protein (31-33).

92

Fortunately, the latest advances in molecular biology and nanotechnology have overcome this

93

limitation by adopting nanoparticle engineering to serve as platforms for vaccines. The efficacy

94

of these nanoparticle-engineered vaccines outperforms traditional vaccines, such as whole

95

inactivated vaccines of bacterial and viral pathogens (34-38). Moreover, recent studies have

96

shed light on the immunological advantages of nanoparticle-based vaccines in nearly every step

97

of the humoral and cellular immunity: efficient antigen transport to draining lymph nodes,

98

antigen presentation by follicular dendritic and helper T cells, as well as high level of activation

99

of the germinal centers (30, 39, 40). Among the genetically engineered nanoparticles, ferritin is

100

the most well-characterized in the bionanotechnology field. Ferritin, ubiquitous through

101

kingdoms of life, has a conserved role in minimizing damage to cell from reactive oxygen

102

species formed from the Fenton reaction upon excess iron (II). Due to its natural tendency to

103

self-assemble into 24-meric homopolymer and amenability via fusion peptides, ferritin is an

104

ideal candidate for drug delivery and vaccine development (41, 42). Most importantly, its

105

exceptional chemical and thermal stability does not require stringent temperature control,

106

enabling streamlined distribution process, especially in areas with limited resources for cold-

107

chain supplies (41, 43). One of the recently engineered ferritin for vaccine development is the

108

self-assembling Helicobacter pylori-bullfrog (Rana Catesbeiana) hybrid ferritin which carries

109

NH2-terminal residues from the lower subunit of bullfrog ferritin on the core of Helicobacter pylori

110

ferritin to form radially projecting tails (38). The H. pylori ferritin-based nanoparticle has been

111

reported to be an effective platform for vaccines to carry trimeric glycoproteins for presenting

112

viral immunogens on its threefold axis points. Most importantly, it provides stronger protective

113

immunity at a lower dose than soluble immunogens against Influenza and Epstein-Barr viruses,

114

while minimizing the risk of autoimmunity through its genetic diversity from heavy and light

115

chains of human ferritin (38, 44, 45).

116

Despite recent efforts to develop mouse models that fully recapitulates human SARS-

117

CoV-2 infection, the current hACE2-transgenic mouse model fails to mimic pathogenic progress

118

and symptoms of COVID-19 in humans. Ferrets (Mustela putorius furo) on the other hand, are

119

naturally susceptible to human respiratory viruses–Respiratory Syncytial virus (48), Influenza

120

virus (49, 50), and SARS-CoV (51, 52)–making ferret models ideal to study respiratory virus

121

infections in humans. In addition, ferrets share anatomy of upper and lower respiratory tracts,

122

architecture of terminal bronchioles, and density of submucosal glands to those of humans (46,

123

47). Recently, we and others have shown that SARS-CoV-2-infected ferrets develop immune

124

responses and pathogenic progress similar to humans’, and shed virus through nasal wash,

125

saliva, urine, and fecal samples, which highly recapitulate human SARS-CoV-2 infection (53-

126

56). Furthermore, we have also demonstrated the efficacy of the ferret model in drug discovery

127

for SARS-CoV-2 (57). Thus, ferrets represent an infection and transmission animal model of

128

SARS-CoV-2 that should facilitate the development of SARS-CoV-2 therapeutics and vaccines.

129

Here, we demonstrate the immunogenic efficacy of self-assembling spike RBD-ferritin

130

nanoparticle (RBD-nanoparticle) as an efficient SARS-CoV-2 vaccine antigen. We purified the

131

RBD-nanoparticle from transfected HEK293T cells and immunized ferrets via intramuscular (IM)

132

and intranasal (IN) routes to monitor the induction of neutralizing antibodies. Furthermore, we

133

challenged the vaccinated ferrets with SARS-CoV-2 and observed protective immunity against

134

SARS-CoV-2. Taken together, we propose the self-assembling RBD-nanoparticles as a

135

potential vaccine candidate that effectively protects against SARS-CoV-2 infection.

Results
Purification and characterization of RBD-ferritin nanoparticles

139

Kanekiyo et al. have discovered the use of engineered ferritin in vaccine developments

140

by fusion with viral immunogens (38, 44). Briefly, the NH2-terminal tail from the lower subunit of

141

bullfrog ferritin was fused to H. pylori ferritin so that the bullfrog-originated tail and viral

142

immunogen were fused by the linker and presented on the threefold axis points of the H. pylori

143

ferritin core. The human codon-optimized RBD of SARS-CoV-2 Wuhan-Hu-1 strain

144

(NC_045512) was fused to the IL-2 signal peptide at the amino terminus and the H. pylori-

145

bullfrog ferritin at the carboxyl terminus to generate the RBD-ferritin fusion. A computer-assisted

146

modeling predicts the 3D structure of RBD-ferritin nanoparticles with RBD forming radial

147

projections on the threefold axis point of fully assembled nanoparticles (Fig. 1A). Ferritin and

148

RBD-ferritin fusion proteins were readily purified from the supernatants of transfected HEK293T

149

cells (Fig. 1B). To demonstrate the 24-mer self-assembly of ferritin nanoparticles, purified ferritin

150

and RBD-ferritin proteins were subjected to size exclusion chromatography with columns

151

designed to have a maximum resolution for proteins with kilodalton and megadalton ranges of

152

molecular weight. As a result, the purified ferritin nanoparticles and RBD-nanoparticles showed

153

peaks at approximately 408 kDa and 1350 kDa, respectively, corresponding to 24-mers of each

154

protein (Fig. 1C). These results indicate that RBD-ferritin protein is readily purified from

155

mammalian cells to homogeneity and efficiently assembles into 24-mer nanoparticles.

157

Immunization with RBD-nanoparticle induces neutralizing antibody in ferrets

158

To test the vaccine efficacy of purified RBD-nanoparticles, we immunized 16-20 months-

159

old ferrets (n=10/immunization route), which is equivalent to 30 years of age in humans. While

160

intramuscular (IM) immunization is the most widely used route for vaccine delivery, intranasal

161

(IN) immunization closely resembles infection with respiratory pathogens and efficiently

162

stimulates mucosal immunity (58). Ferrets were injected with 15g RBD-nanoparticle via IM

163

route only or both IM and IN routes over 31 days with boosting immunizations at days 14 and 28

164

(Fig. 2A). Blood was drawn from each ferret prior to primary and boosting immunizations on

165

days 14 and 28. All ferrets vaccinated with RBD-nanoparticles produced strong neutralizing

166

antibodies after the second boosting immunization performed at day 28. Neutralization titer did

167

not show statistically significant difference between the routes of immunization (Fig. 2B). These

168

data indicate that RBD-nanoparticle immunization induces strong neutralizing antibody

169

regardless of the route of immunization.

170
171

Immunization with RBD-nanoparticle promotes rapid viral clearance and protects ferrets

172

from SARS-CoV-2 challenge

173

Immunized ferrets were challenged with 105.0 TCID50/mL of NMC2019-nCoV02 strain

174

SARS-CoV-2 three days after the last immunization at day 31 and monitored for clinical

175

symptoms resembling COVID-19. Ferrets with adjuvant only-immunization was included as

176

control group. Over a total of 10 days from the day of challenge infection, ferrets with adjuvant

177

only-immunization showed increase in body temperature and decrease in body weight (Fig. 3A).

178

On the contrary, ferrets immunized with RBD-nanoparticle did not show any change in either

179

body temperature or body weight (Fig. 3A and B). Minor body weight changes in ferrets

180

immunized by IM route showed a statistically insignificant difference compared to the adjuvant

181

only-immunized ferrets (Fig. 3B). On the other hand, ferrets immunized by IM and IN routes

182

provided stronger protection with high statistical significance against body weight loss as shown

183

by the minimal reduction of body weight followed by a constant increase thereafter (Fig. 3B).

184

Nasal wash samples were collected every other day for 10 days after the virus challenge, and 3

185

ferrets were sacrificed at 3 and 6 days post-infection (dpi) to harvest the lungs. Consistent with

186

the trend shown in body temperature and weight, immunized ferrets showed rapid viral

187

clearance in nasal washes (Fig. 3C) and lungs (Fig. 3D) of both groups of vaccinated ferrets. It

188

should be noted that IM and IN immunization showed slightly more effective viral clearance in

189

nasal washes at 4 dpi than IM immunization (Fig. 3C).

190

To further investigate the potency of protective immunity by RBD-nanoparticle, we

191

challenged the immunized ferrets with a higher titer (106.0 TCID50/mL) of SARS-CoV-2 following

192

the same immunization protocol (Fig. 2A). Consistently, RBD-nanoparticles-immunized ferrets

193

showed no increase of body temperature compared to adjuvant only-immunized ferrets (Fig.

194

S1). While adjuvant only-immunized ferrets suffered from cough, runny nose, and reduction in

195

movement, RBD-nanoparticles-immunized ferrets showed only mild reduction in movement on

196

the 2nd and 3rd days after the high virus titer challenge (Table 1). On the other hand, IN and IM

197

immunization showed more potent protective immunity upon challenge with a high virus titer

198

than IN immunization only (Fig. S2). IN and IM immunization led to faster clearance of infectious

199

virus in nasal washes at 4 and 8 dpi than IM immunization alone (Fig. S2A). Infectious virus

200

titers of lungs were also lower in IN and IM-immunized ferrets than in IM-immunized ferrets (Fig.

201

S2B). These data demonstrate that RBD-nanoparticle induces strong protective immunity to

202

suppress SARS-CoV-2-induced clinical symptoms and promote viral clearance. Moreover, a

203

combination of IN and IM immunization induces stronger anti-viral immunity against challenge of

204

high titer SARS-CoV-2 than IM immunization alone.

205
206

RBD-ferritin vaccination blocks lung damage from SARS-CoV-2 challenge

207

COVID-19 has most commonly been shown to be associated with a spectrum of lung

208

damage. To compare lung histopathologies among immunized ferrets, RNAscope in situ

209

hybridization and histopathological examination were conducted (Fig. 4). Lung tissues

210

harvested from naïve ferrets were included as negative controls (Fig. 4D). RNAscope in situ

211

hybridization results showed that the adjuvant only-immunized ferrets had a number of SARS-

212

CoV-2 RNA-positive cells at 3 and 6 dpi with infiltration of numerous inflammatory immune cells

213

(Fig. 4A-E). At 3 dpi, IM- or IM and IN-immunized ferrets showed considerable reduction of viral

214

RNAs in the lungs compared to adjuvant only-immunized ferrets (Fig. 4). At 6 dpi, lung tissues

215

of IM- or IM and IN-immunized ferrets showed complete clearance of viral RNAs (Fig. 4F-G),

216

while adjuvant only-immunized ferrets still showed high viral RNAs (Fig. 4E). Finally, IM- or IM

217

and IN-immunized ferrets showed little or no infiltration of inflammatory immune cells in infected

218

lung (Fig. 4B-G). These data show that RBD-nanoparticle immunization accelerates viral

219

clearance in the lung and suppresses the infiltration of inflammatory immune cells.

Discussion

221

Since the first discovery in Wuhan, China in late 2019, SARS-CoV-2 has rapidly spread

222

around the world and was declared a pandemic in 3 months. Confirmed infection and death

223

counts have skyrocketed to over 88 million infections and 2 million deaths, and the statistics are

224

still on a continuous rise. Although 80% of the infections do not progress to severe COVID-19,

225

the recent surge in infections and severe patients have led to subsequent increase in mortality

226

rates (8, 9). While several vaccines were approved at accelerated rates (59, 60), additional

227

indepth study of mRNA-based vaccines regarding safety concerns and long-term effects still

228

need to be addressed as they are the first approved mRNA human vaccine of its kind.

229

Moreover, taking the growing evidence of reinfections into consideration, recovered patients

230

cannot be completely excluded from the population requiring vaccination (61-64). Therefore,

231

there still is a constant need for alternative vaccine approaches against SARS-CoV-2 using

232

relatively well-characterized approaches. Recent advances in nanotechnology has favorably

233

allowed the application of nanoparticles in the field of vaccinology to develop safer yet potent

234

vaccines. One of the most promising candidates is H. pylori-bullfrog ferritin that has been

235

genetically engineered to carry a protruding tail from the bullfrog on the self-assembling ferritin

236

core of H. pylori, and serves as a platform to build nanoparticles of immunogen. This approach

237

has proven higher efficacy in lower dose than traditional protein subunit vaccines. This

238

approach also highlights lower risk of vaccine-related adverse effects and potentially greater

239

accessibility to the public with reduced production cost (38, 44, 45). Importantly, inherent

240

stability of ferritin nanoparticles from heat and chemicals may shed light to remove the necessity

241

of strict cold-chain supply required for the currently distributing mRNA-based vaccines (41).

242

SARS-CoV-2 carries Spike protein to attach to the host receptor ACE2, which triggers

243

membrane fusion for entry into host cells. The RBD of Spike protein confers the specificity to

244

bind ACE2 and therefore is a promising target for vaccine development throughout the

245

Coronaviridae family. As also shown from previously developed vaccine candidates against

246

Coronaviruses (17, 65, 66), we selected the RBD as a vaccine antigen. However, soluble

247

antigen is weakly immunogenic and therefore require higher dose of antigen along with an

248

adjuvant, which correlates with higher risk of vaccine-related adverse effects (29). In this study,

249

we engineered the fusion of SARS-CoV-2 Spike RBD with H. pylori-bullfrog ferritin to develop

250

RBD-nanoparticle vaccine. Ferrets immunized with RBD-nanoparticles carried efficient

251

neutralizing antibodies against SARS-CoV-2 and were protected from fever and body weight

252

loss upon SARS-CoV-2 challenge. These clinical symptoms corresponded to the accelerated

253

viral clearance in nasal washes and lungs following SARS-CoV-2 challenge. We further

254

investigated the vaccine potential of RBD-nanoparticles by challenging the immunized ferrets

255

with a high virus titer (106.0 TCID50/mL). Immunized ferrets showed considerably reduced clinical

256

symptoms, such as body weight loss, cough, runny nose, and movement activity, upon

257

challenge of high titer SARS-CoV-2. Moreover, RNAscope analyses showed rapid viral

258

clearance in the lungs of immunized ferrets compared to those of adjuvant only-immunized

259

ferrets. Histological analysis also showed little or no lung tissue damage and inflammatory

260

immune cell infiltration in immunized ferrets. As seen from other protein vaccines such as HPV

261

VLP that requires prime-boost regimens (67), the first immunization alone was not sufficient to

262

induce neutralizing antibodies. IN + IM immunization elicited more potent protective immunity

263

upon challenge of high titer SARS-CoV-2 than IM immunization alone, which is consistent with

264

previous reports showing stronger induction of mucosal immunity upon IN than IM immunization

265

to protect against respiratory pathogens such as MERS-CoV (65, 66, 68), Influenza virus (69),

266

and Mycoplasma pneumoniae (70). To differentiate vaccine efficacy between IN immunization

267

and IN and IM immunization, we repeated the viral challenge with high titer (106.0 TCID50/mL)

268

and observed the improvement of viral clearance in lung and nasal washes from IN and IM-

269

immunized ferrets. However, as IN and IM immunization was employed together in this study,

270

further investigation is required to directly compare vaccine efficacy between IN immunization

271

and IM immunization against SARS-CoV-2 infection. Also, ferrets challenged with 106.0

272

TCID50/mL virus titer showed delayed viral clearance compared to ferrets challenged with 105.0

273

TCID50/mL virus titer. However, 105.0 TCID50/mL is already excessive and not physiologically

274

relevant to real clinical setting.

275

In this study, we integrated SARS-CoV-2-derived immunogen into self-assembling

276

nanoparticle to develop an effective vaccine candidate against COVID-19. IM-immunized

277

animals showed strong induction of neutralizing antibody, rapid clearance of respiratory track

278

virus, and clear suppression of clinical symptoms, which is further enhanced in combination with

279

intranasal immunization. However, additional comprehensive studies are needed to understand

280

the humoral and cellular immunity elicited by RBD-nanoparticle administration and differential

281

activation of IgA-mediated mucosal immunity upon different immunization routes. Taken

282

together, our study indicated that immunization with self-assembling SARS-CoV-2 RBD-

283

nanoparticle elicits protective immunity against SARS-CoV-2 infection, showing its potential as a

284

vaccine candidate in the midst of the COVID-19 pandemic.

Expression vector construction

289

The gene encoding the recombinant ferritin engineered from Helicobacter pylori non-

290

heme ferritin and 2nd to 9th residues of bullfrog (Rana catesbeiana) ferritin lower subunit was a

291

gift from Gary Nabel (44). Gene encoding Spike of SARS-CoV-2 (GenBank NC_0101080)

292

codon-optimized for human codon usage (GenBank MC_0101081) was purchased from

293

Genscript (pUC57-2019-nCoV-S). RBD was used to generate a fragment encoding RBD-

294

SSGGASVLA linker-recombinant ferritin. For expression plasmid, a commercially available

295

pFUSE vector (Invivogen) was engineered to replace human ferritin light chain gene promoter

Computer-assisted three-dimensional model of nanoparticles

300

Previously solved structures of H. pylori ferritin nanoparticle (PDB: 3EGM) and SARS-

301

CoV-2 RBD (PDB: 7JMP) were processed with PyMol (Schrodinger) and Autodesk Meshmixer

302

(Autodesk). The model was generated to reflect the linker connecting the end of RBD to the

303

start of H. pylori ferritin monomer.

Expression and purification of nanoparticles

306

HEK293T cells were directly purchased from American Type Culture Collection (ATCC)

307

and maintained in DMEM medium (Gibco) supplemented with 10% FBS (Gibco) and 1%

308

penicillin/streptomycin (Gibco). The cells were transiently transfected with polyethylenimine

309

(Polysciences) and respective vector plasmids in Opti-MEM and FreeStyle 293 medium (Gibco)

310

supplemented with 3mM valproic acid. Supernatants containing the nanoparticle were harvested

311

72 h after transfection and concentrated with Labscale TFF system equipped with 100 kDa and

312

500 kDa MWCO filters (Millipore Sigma). The concentrates were purified by size exclusion

313

chromatography (NGC Medium-Pressure Liquid Chromatography, Bio-Rad) using Superdex

314

200 10/300 GL and HiPrep 16/60 Sephacryl S-500 HR (Cytiva) running degased PBS at

315

0.4ml/min. Standard curves were plotted using Gel filtration LMW/HMW calibration Kit (Cytiva)

Animal Care

327

Male and female ferrets of 16-20 months old and tested seronegative for Influenza A,

328

MERS-CoV, and SARS-CoV were purchased from ID Bio Corporation (Cheongju, Korea). The

329

ferrets were housed in ABSL3 facility within Chungbuk National University (Cheongju, Korea)

330

with 12 h light/dark cycle with access to water and diet. All animal cares were performed strictly

331

following the animal care guideline and experiment protocols approved by the Institutional

332

Animal Care and Use Committee (IACUC) in Chungbuk National University.

334

Ferret immunizations and viral challenge

335

RBD-ferritin nanoparticles (volume: 300ul) and AddaVax adjuvant (volume: 300ul) were

336

administered into the legs through intramuscular injection and/or intranasal route. Subsequently,

337

ferrets were intranasally infected with 105.0 or 106.0 TCID50/mL SARS-CoV-2. Body weight and

338

temperature were measured, and veterinary clinical symptoms were observed every day. Blood

339

and nasal washes were collected every other day for 10 days. Three animals per group were

340

sacrificed at days 3 and 6 to collect lung tissues with individual scissors. Infectious viruses from

341

the nasal washes and lung tissues were quantified by inoculation onto Vero cells. Veterinary

342

symptoms were scored accordingly to our previous publication (57).

Titration of neutralizing antibody in serum

345

The neutralizing antibody assay against SARS-CoV-2 was carried out using a micro-

346

neutralization assay in Vero cells. Collected ferret serum specimens were inactivated at 56°C

347

for 30 min. Initial 1:2 serum dilutions were made with the medium, and two-fold serial dilutions of

348

all samples were made to a final serum dilution of 1:2 to 1:256. For each well, 50 μL of serially

349

diluted serum was mixed with 50 μL (equal volume) of 100 TCID50 of SARS-CoV-2 and

350

incubated at 37°C for 1 h to neutralize the infectious virus. The mixtures were then transferred

351

to Vero cell monolayers. Vero cells were incubated at 37°C in 5% CO2 for 4 days and monitored

352

for 50% reduction in cytopathic effect (CPE).

RNAscope

355

SARS-CoV-2 RNA (Spike gene) was detected using the Spike-specific probe (Advanced

356

Cell Diagnostics, Cat. # 848561) and visualized using RNAscope 2.5 HD Reagent Kit RED

357

(Advanced Cell Diagnostics, Cat. # 322360). Lung tissue sections were fixed in 4% neutral-

358

buffered formalin and embedded in paraffin, according to the manufacturer’s instructions,

359

followed by counterstaining with 50% Gill’s hematoxylin #1 (Polysciences, cat # 24242-1000).
