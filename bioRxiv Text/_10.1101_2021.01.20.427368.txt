Abstract
The severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), the causative agent of the
current COVID-19 global pandemic, utilizes the host receptor angiotensin-converting enzyme 2
(ACE2) for viral entry. However, other host factors may also play major roles in viral infection.
Here we report that the stress-inducible molecular chaperone GRP78 can form a complex with
the SARS-CoV-2 Spike protein and ACE2 intracellularly and on the cell surface, and that the
substrate binding domain of GRP78 is critical for this function. Knock-down of GRP78 by siRNA
dramatically reduced cell surface ACE2 expression. Treatment of lung epithelial cells with a
humanized monoclonal antibody (hMAb159), selected for its ability to cause GRP78
endocytosis and its safe clinical profile in preclinical models, reduces cell surface ACE2
expression, SARS-CoV-2 Spike-driven viral entry, and significantly inhibits SARS-CoV-2
infection in vitro. Our data suggest that GRP78 is an important host auxiliary factor for SARSCoV-2 entry and infection and a potential target to combat this novel pathogen and other viruses
that utilize GRP78.

Introduction
The coronavirus pandemic caused by the severe acute respiratory syndrome
coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is currently the greatest threat to global public health. While
SARS-CoV-2 vaccines provide optimism to combat COVID-19, identification of targets that may
offer therapy for those ineligible for vaccine or infected by escape mutants bypassing vaccine
protection is of great interest. While it has been elucidated that the SARS-CoV-2-Spike protein
(SARS-2-S) responsible for viral attachment and fusion to the host cells exploits angiotensinconverting enzyme 2 (ACE2) as the cellular receptor for viral entry, evidence is emerging that
other host factors may serve as critical entry co-factors for productive infection (1, 2). Recent
molecular docking analyses have identified a putative site of interaction between the 78 kilo-

Dalton glucose-regulated protein (GRP78) and the receptor binding domain (RBD) of SARS-2S, raising the interesting possibility that GRP78 can facilitate or serve as an alternative receptor
for SARS-CoV-2 entry (3, 4). GRP78, also known as BiP or HSPA5, is broadly expressed in
bronchial epithelial cells and the respiratory mucosa at levels significantly higher than ACE2 (5).
In recent case-control studies, serum GRP78 levels were found to be elevated in SARS-CoV-2
cases (6). In its capacity as a stress-inducible molecular chaperone, GRP78 is expressed in
many cell types and serves critical protein folding functions in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER),
and upon translocation from the ER to the cell surface under pathophysiological conditions, acts
as co-receptor for various signaling molecules, as well as for viral entry (7-11). For
coronaviruses, GRP78 is known to interact with the bat coronavirus HKU9 and MERS-CoV
Spike proteins, facilitating cell surface attachment and viral entry (12). Furthermore, virus
infection leads to ER stress and increased total and cell surface GRP78 (csGRP78) expression
further enhancing viral infection in a positive feedback cycle (11). Here, utilizing biochemical and
imaging approaches, we established GRP78 interactions with SARS-2-S and ACE2. We further
demonstrated that a humanized monoclonal antibody (hMAb159) with high specificity against
GRP78 and a safe clinical profile in preclinical models (13) depletes csGRP78 and reduces cell
surface ACE2 (csACE2), SARS-CoV-2 entry and infection.

Results and Discussion
To test GRP78 binding to SARS-2-S in cells, we expressed HA-tagged SARS-2-S (HA-Spike)
and FLAG-tagged GRP78 (F-GRP78) in African green monkey kidney epithelial VeroE6 cells
overexpressing ACE2 (VeroE6-ACE2) as a model system. Co-immunoprecipitation (IP) for the
HA-epitope showed that F-GRP78 can be pulled down with HA-Spike suggesting potential
interaction between the two proteins (Fig. 1A). Co-IP with antibody against the FLAG-epitope
further showed that F-GRP78 can bind HA-Spike and ACE2 (Fig. 1A). Next, we tested the ability

of HA-Spike and ACE2 to bind three dominant negative mutants of GRP78: a substrate bindingdefective mutant (T453D), an ATP binding-defective mutant (G227D), and a co-chaperone
interaction-defective mutant (R197H) (7). Compared to wild type (WT) GRP78, G227D and
R197H mutants bound with HA-Spike, albeit at a lower level, while the T453D mutant did not
whereas both G227D and T453D mutants were unable to bind ACE2 (Fig. 1B). These results
indicate that SBD of GRP78 is most critical for interaction between GRP78 and SARS-2-S
providing experimental evidence consistent with a previous in silico molecular docking study (3),
and that GRP78 binding to ACE2 requires both the SBD and the ATP binding domain.
Viruses, including SARS-CoV-2, usurp the host ER translational machinery to synthesize
the viral proteins in massive quantities. Thus, as a major ER chaperone, GRP78 plays an
essential role in viral protein synthesis and maturation (11). Confocal immunofluorescence (IF)
microscopy of permeabilized cells expressing HA-Spike showed that it co-localized with
endogenous GRP78 in the perinuclear region typical of the ER, and in non-permeabilized cells
at the cell surface (Fig. 1C). The IF results were confirmed using the Proximity Ligation Assay
(PLA) which reveals protein-protein interactions at distances <40 nm (Fig. 1D). Likewise, by
both confocal IF microscopy and PLA, co-localization between endogenous GRP78 and ACE2
was detected in the perinuclear region typical of the ER, and their co-localization was also
observed on the cell surface (Fig.1E and F). Together, these studies suggest that GRP78 could
serve as a foldase for SARS-2-S and ACE2 in the ER, and act as a scaffold for SARS-2-S and
ACE2 interaction on the cell surface. Recent studies showed that GRP78 deficiency could lead
to decrease in cell surface receptors such as CD109 and CD44 (10, 14). Interestingly, while
knockdown of GRP78 by siRNA did not affect total ACE2 protein level, the level of csACE2
decreased markedly in parallel with a decrease in csGRP78 (Fig. 1G). Collectively, our results
reveal that GRP78, in addition to potentially facilitating SARS-2-S binding to ACE2, may also be

important for ACE2 trafficking, localization, and stability on the cell surface, and SARS-2-S
production in the ER following viral infection, which awaits future investigation.
To test directly whether csGRP78 facilitates SARS-CoV-2 entry, we employed the human
lung epithelial cell line H1299 and the vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV) pseudo particles bearing
SARS-2-S as viral entry model system. To specifically target csGRP78, we utilized humanized
MAb159 (hMAb159), a monoclonal antibody established to have high specificity and affinity
against GRP78 with safe clinical profile in preclinical models (13). In H1299 cells, hMAb159
treatment led to reduced csGRP78 staining (Fig. 2A), consistent with the ability of MAb159 to
cause GRP78 endocytosis and degradation established in other cell systems (13). Flow
cytometry analysis of the same cells pretreated with either human IgG1 or hMAb159 showed
that hMAb159 reduced both the number of cells expressing csACE2 and the level of csACE2
(Fig. 2B). In Western blot analysis of H1299 cell lysate, hMAb159 only recognizes a single
protein GRP78 and has no cross reactivity with its closely related cytosolic homolog HSP70,
reaffirming its high specificity for GRP78 (Fig. 2C). In viral entry assays, we observed that pretreatment

with hMAb59 significantly reduced SARS-2-S-driven pseudovirus entry at

concentration of 0.5 μg/ml but did not affect VSV-G dependent entry into H1299 cells (Fig. 2D
and E) or cell viability, which excluded the possibility that the reduced SARS-CoV-2 entry was
due to cytotoxicity caused by hMAb159 (Fig. 2F). Furthermore, VeroE6-ACE2 cells preincubated with hMAb159 prior to infection with live SARS-CoV-2 virus exhibited significant
decrease in the number of plaques compared with human IgG1 control (Fig. 2G). Interestingly, a
recent study showed GRP78 co-localizing with SARS-2-S following live virus infection and
AR12, an inhibitor of chaperones including GRP78 suppressed SARS-CoV-2 infection (15).
Collectively, these results suggest that through targeting host auxiliary chaperones such as
GRP78 required for viral entry and production could offer a new strategy toward the
development of broad spectrum anti-viral therapy. It is also tempting to speculate that csGRP78

COVID-19 which warrants further investigation.
