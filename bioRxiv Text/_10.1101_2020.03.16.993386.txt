A novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) outbreak has caused a global pandemic resulting in tens of
thousands of infections and thousands of deaths worldwide. The RNA-dependent RNA
polymerase (RdRp, also named nsp12), which catalyzes the synthesis of viral RNA, is a key
component of coronaviral replication/transcription machinery and appears to be a primary target
for the antiviral drug, remdesivir. Here we report the cryo-EM structure of 2019-nCoV full-length
nsp12 in complex with cofactors nsp7 and nsp8 at a resolution of 2.9-Å. Additional to the
conserved architecture of the polymerase core of the viral polymerase family and a nidovirus
RdRp-associated nucleotidyltransferase (NiRAN) domain featured in coronaviral RdRp, nsp12
possesses a newly identified β-hairpin domain at its N-terminal. Key residues for viral replication
and transcription are observed. A comparative analysis to show how remdesivir binds to this
polymerase is also provided. This structure provides insight into the central component of
coronaviral replication/transcription machinery and sheds light on the design of new antiviral
therapeutics targeting viral RdRp.

Corona Virus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) caused by a novel coronavirus 2019-nCoV has recently
emerged (1-3). According to the World Health Organization (WHO) on March 11, 2020, 11800
infections and 4291 fatalities have been confirmed globally. 2019-nCoV is reported to be a new
member of the betacoronavirus genus and is closely related to severe acute respiratory syndrome
coronavirus (SARS-CoV) and to several bat coronaviruses (4). Compared to SARS-CoV and
MERS-CoV, 2019-nCoV appears to exhibit faster human-to-human transmission, thus leading to
the WHO declaration of a Public Health Emergency of International Concern (PHEIC)(1, 3).
CoVs employ a multi-subunit replication/transcription machinery, being assembled by a set of
non-structural proteins (nsp) produced as cleavage products of the ORF1a and ORF1ab viral
polyproteins (5) to facilitate virus replication and transcription. A key component, the RNAdependent RNA polymerase (nsp12), catalyzes the synthesis of viral RNA and thus plays a central
role in the replication and transcription cycle of 2019-nCoV, possibly with the assistance of nsp7
and nsp8 as co-factors (5, 6). Therefore, nsp12 is a primary target for the nucleotide analog
antiviral inhibitors, e.g. remdesivir which shows potential to treat 2019-nCoV infections (7, 8). To
inform drug design we have determined the structure of nsp12, in complex with its cofactors nsp7
and nsp8 by cryo-Electron Microscopy (Cryo-EM) using two different protocols, one in the
absence of DTT (Dataset-1) and the other in the presence of DTT (Dataset-2).
The bacterially expressed full-length 2019-nCoV nsp12 (residues S1-Q932) was incubated with
nsp7 (residues S1-Q83) and nsp8 (residues A1-Q198), and the complex was then purified (fig.
S1). Cryo-EM grids were prepared using this complex and preliminary screening revealed
excellent particle density with good dispersity. After collecting and processing 7,994 micrograph
movies, we obtained a 2.9-Å resolution 3D reconstruction of one nsp12 monomer in complex with
one nsp7-nsp8 pair and one nsp8. Like that observed in SARS-CoV nsp12-nsp7-nsp8 (6), we
observed classes corresponding to an nsp12 monomer in complex one nsp8, as well as individual
nsp12s, but these do not give atomic resolution reconstructions (fig. S2). However, the nsp12nsp7-nsp8 complex provides all the structural information for complete and comprehensive
analysis.
The structure of the 2019-nCoV nsp12 contains a “right hand” polymerase domain (residues S367F920), and a nidovirus-unique N-terminal extension domain (residues D60-R249) adopting a
nidovirus RdRp-associated nucleotidyltransferase (NiRAN)(9) architecture, being connected by
an interface domain (residues A250-F369) (Figs. 1, A and B). An additional N-terminal β-hairpin
(V31-K50) was built with the guidance of an unambiguous cryo-EM map (fig. S3A), inserting into
the groove clamped by the NiRAN domain and the palm subdomain in the RdRp domain (Fig. 2).
The nsp7-nsp8 pair shows a conserved structure similar to the SARS-CoV nsp7-nsp8 pair (6, 10).
The orientation of the N-terminal helix of another individual nsp8 bound to nsp12 is shifted
compared with that in the nsp7-nsp8 pair (fig. S4). The polypeptides of nsp12 can be traced in the
map, except for S1-V30, T51-S68, H75, K103-V111, D336, T896-S904, F921-Q932, which
cannot be observed.
Although the overall architecture of 2019-nCoV nsp12-nsp7-nsp8 complex is generally similar to
that of SARS-CoV with an r.m.s.d value of 0.82 for 1,078 Cɑ atoms there are key features that
distinguish them. First, the cryo-EM map allows us to build the structure of 2019-nCoV nsp12
covering almost all residues, presenting the first insight into the complete architecture of
coronaviral RdRp. In SARS-CoV nsp12, there are seven helices with a three-stranded β-sheet at
the end that make up the NiRAN domain (6) (Fig. 2A). Residues Y69-R118 constitute an
additional structural block with three anti-parallel β-strands and one helix. Residues N215-D218

form a β-strand in 2019-nCoV nsp12. We reasoned that the contact of this region with the strand
(residues V96-A100) helps to stabilize it. As a result, these four strands form a compact semi βbarrel architecture. Therefore, we identify residues Y69-R249 as the complete coronaviral NiRAN
domain. Second, the cryo-EM map helps us to identify a unique N-terminal β-hairpin (Figs. 1A
and 2A). This β-hairpin inserts in the groove clamped by the NiRAN domain and the palm
subdomain in the RdRp domain and forms a set of close contacts to stabilize the overall structure
(Fig. 2B and fig. S5). Another point to note is that, we have observed C301-C306 and C487-C645
form disulfide bonds in the absence of DTT (Dataset-1). However, in the presence of DTT
(Dataset-2), chelated zinc ions are present and in the same location as that observe in SARS-CoV
(fig. S3B). We reasoned the different purification buffer has led to this variation.
The polymerase domain adopts the conserved architecture of the viral polymerase family (11) and
is composed of three subdomains, including a fingers subdomain (residues S397-A581 and K621G679), a palm subdomain (residues T582-P620 and T680-Q815), and a thumb subdomain
(residues H816-E920) (Fig. 1). The catalytic cations, which are usually observed in viral
polymerase structure for RNA synthesis (12, 13) are not observed, possibly because manganese
was not included in the buffer for purification or in the cryo-EM sampling buffer.
The active site chamber of 2019-nCoV RdRp domain is formed by the conserved polymerase
motifs A-G in the palm domain and configured like other RNA polymerases (Figs. 1A and 3A;
fig. S6). Motif A covers residues 611-TPHLMGWDYPKCDRAM-626 with a potential divalentcation-binding residue D618, which is conserved in HCV ns5b (residue D220) and poliovirus (PV)
3Dpol (residue D233) (12, 13) (Figs. 3, B and C). Motif B is in the region 680TSSGDATTAYANSVFNICQAVTANVNALLST-710.
Motif
C
(residues
753FSMMILSDDAVVCFN-767) contains the catalytic residues (759-SDD-761) in the turn between
the two β-strands. These catalytic residues are also conserved in viral RdRp, e.g. 317-GDD-319
in HCV ns5b and 327-GDD-329 PV 3Dpol with the first residue being a glycine residue as an
alternative. Motif D is assigned as 775-LVASIKNFKSVLYYQNNVFMSE-796. Motif E (810HEFCSQHTMLV-820) forms the tight loop. Motif F (912-KKNQHGGLRE-921) forms an
ordered loop (β-loop) connecting two anti-parallel β-strands. Motif G is in 500KSAGFPFNKWGKARLYYDS-518.
In this structure, the four positively charged solvent-accessible paths converge into a central cavity
where the RdRp motifs mediate template-directed RNA synthesis (Fig. 3D). The configurations of
the template/primer entry paths, the nucleoside triphosphate (NTP) entry channel, and the nascent
strand exit path are similar to those described for HCV and PV polymerase (14) (Figs. 3, B and
C). The NTP entry channel is formed by a set of hydrophilic residues, including K545, R553 and
R555 in motif F. The RNA template is expected to enter the active site composed of motifs A and
C through a groove clamped by motif F and G. Motif E and the thumb subdomain support the
primer strand. The product-template hybrid exits the active site through the RNA exit tunnel at the
front side of the polymerase.
Remdesivir, the single Sp isomer of the 2-ethylbutyl L-alaninate phosphoramidate prodrug (15)
(fig. S7), has been reported to inhibit 2019-nCoV proliferation and have potential to treat patients
in the clinic (7, 8). The efficacy of chain-terminating nucleotide analogs requires viral RdRps to
recognize and successfully incorporate the active form of the inhibitors into the growing RNA
strand. Because of the structural conservation on the polymerase catalytic chamber between 2019nCoV and HCV ns5b polymerase, as well as the likely similar mechanisms of action of remdesivir
and sofosbuvir (12, 16) (2’-F-2’-C-methyluridine monophosphate prodrug which targets HCV

ns5b and has been approved for the treatment of chronic HCV infection) (fig. S7), a model of
2019-nCoV nsp12 with remdesivir diphosphate is proposed (Fig. 4). In 2019-nCoV nsp12, the 2’
hydroxyl of the incoming NTP is likely to form hydrogen bonds with T680 and N691 in motif B
(Figs. 4, A and B). In addition, D623 in motif A is positioned to interrogate the 3’ hydroxyl through
hydrogen bonding. Moreover, the hydrophobic side chain of V557 in motif F is likely to stack with
and stabilize the +1 template RNA uridine base to base pair with the incoming triphosphate
remdesivir (ppp-remdesivir). In the structures of HCV ns5b elongation complex or its complex
with pp-sofosbuvir, a key feature is that the incorporated pp-sofosbuvir disrupts the hydrogen
bonding network between S282 and D225 (Figs. 4, C and D), which is necessary to stabilize the
incoming natural nucleotide (12). However, key contacts formed by S282 with the incoming
nucleotide and the surrounding environment can result in an S→T resistance mutation that is
already observed in the clinic (17). In the structure of apo 2019-nCoV nsp12, the orientation of
S682 and D623, which are strictly conserved with S282 and D225 in HCV ns5b, is similar to that
observed in the HCV ns5b-pp-sofosbuvir complex, indicating a different recognition mechanism
with that inhibitor. Nevertheless, the close distance of S682 with the incoming ppp-remdesivir and
the environment surrounding the inhibitor alters the appearance of a drug-resistant mutation
associated with remdesivir treatments.
The rapid global spread of 2019-nCoV has emphasized the need for the development of new
coronavirus vaccines and therapeutics. The viral polymerase nsp12 looks an excellent target for
new therapeutics, especially given that lead inhibitors already exist in the form of compounds such
as remdesivir. This target, in addition to other promising drug targets such as the main protease,
whose structure was recently determined by our group (18) in complex with an inhibitor (19, 20)
will support the development of a cocktail of anti-coronavirus treatments that potentially can be
used for the discovery of broad-spectrum antivirals.

Protein production and purification
The 2019-nCoV nsp12 (GenBank: MN908947) gene was cloned into a modified pET-22a
vector, with the C-terminus possessing a 10 × His-tag. The plasmids were transformed into E. coil
BL21 (DE3), and the transformed cells were cultured at 37 °C in LB media containing 100 mg/L
ampicillin. After the OD600 reached 0.8, the culture was cooled to 16 °C and supplemented with
0.5 mM IPTG. After overnight induction, the cells were harvested through centrifugation, and the
pellets were resuspended in lysis buffer (20 mM Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 150 mM NaCl, 4 mM MgCl,
10% glycerol) and homogenized with an ultra-high-pressure cell disrupter at 4 °C. The insoluble
material was removed through centrifugation at 12,000 rpm. The fusion protein was first purified
by Ni-NTA affinity chromatography and elution with lysis buffer and then further purified by
passage through a Hitrap Q ion-exchange column (GE Healthcare, USA) before loading onto a
Superdex 200 10/300 Increase column (GE Healthcare, USA) in a buffer containing 20 mM TrisHCl, pH 7.5, 250 mM NaCl and 4 mM MgCl2. Purified nsp12 was concentrated to 4 mg ml/L and
stored at 4 °C.
The full-length 2019-nCoV nsp7 and nsp8 were co-expressed in E. coil BL21 (DE3) cells as a notagged protein and a 6 × His-SUMO fusion protein, respectively. After purification by Ni-NTA
(Novagen) affinity chromatography, the nsp7-nsp8 complex was eluted through on-column tag
cleavage by ULP protease. The eluate was further purified by Hitrap Q ion-exchange column (GE
Healthcare, USA) and a Superdex 200 10/300 Increase column (GE Healthcare, USA) in a buffer
containing 20 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 250 mM NaCl and 4 mM MgCl2.
Cryo-EM sample preparation and data collection
An aliquot of 3 μL of the sample at 0.7 mg/mL (added with 0.025% DDM) was applied onto
a H2/O2 glow-discharged, 300-mesh Quantifoil R1.2/1.3 grid (Quantifoil, Micro Tools GmbH,
Germany). The grid was then blotted for 3.0 s with a blot force of 0 at 8°C and 100% humidity
and plunge-frozen in liquid ethane using a Vitrobot (Thermo Fisher Scientific, USA). Cryo-EM
data were collected with a 300 keV Titan Krios electron microscope (Thermo Fisher Scientific,
USA) and a K2 Summit direct electron detector (Gatan, USA). Images were recorded at EFTEM
with a 165000× magnification and calibrated super-resolution pixel size 0.82 Å/pixel. The
exposure time was set to 5 s with a total accumulated dose of 60 electrons per Å2. All images were
automatically recorded using SerialEM (21). For Dataset-1, a total of 7,994 images were collected
with a defocus range from 1.0 μm to 1.8 μm. For Dataset-2 (under reducing conditions), a total of
8494 images were collected with a defocus range from 1.1 μm to 2.0 μm. Statistics for data
collection and refinement are in Table S1.
Cryo-EM image processing
All dose-fractioned images were motion-corrected and dose-weighted by MotionCorr2
software (22) and their contrast transfer functions were estimated by cryoSPARC patch CTF
estimation. For Dataset-1, a total of 2,334,248 particles were auto-picked using blob picker and
extracted with a box size of 300 pixels in cryoSPARC (20). The following 2D, 3D classifications
and refinements were all performed in cryoSPARC. 918,133 particles were selected after two
rounds of 2D classification. 100,000 particles were used to do Ab-Initio reconstruction in five

classes, and then these five classes were used as 3D volume templates for heterogeneous
refinement with all selected particles, with 110,176 particles converged into one class. Next, this
particle set was used to perform homogeneous refinement, yielding a resolution of 3.1 Å. After
local refinement, the final resolution reached 2.9 Å. For Dataset-2, the image processing was
conducted using a similar pipeline. 753,481 particles were auto-picked initially, and 145,388
particles were selected after final heterogeneous refinement. The resolution reached 2.99 Å after
non-uniform refinement and 2.95 Å after local refinement with a mask.
Model building and refinement
To solve the structure of the 2019-nCoV nsp12-nsp7-nsp8 complex, the structure of the
SARS-CoV nsp12 (24) and nsp7-8 (25) were individually placed and rigid-body fitted into the
cryo-EM map using UCSF Chimera (26). After the corresponding amino acids were replaced with
those from 2019-nCoV, the model was manually built in Coot (27) with the guidance of the cryoEM map, and in combination with real space refinement with Phenix (28). The data validation
statistics are shown in Table S1.
