Abstract
Severe acute respiratory syndrome-related coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) has resulted in a pandemic and
continues to spread quickly around the globe. Currently, no effective vaccine is available to prevent
COVID-19 and an intense global development activity is in progress. In this context, the different
technology platforms face several challenges resulting from the involvement of a new virus still not
fully characterised. Finding of the right conditions for virus amplification for the development of
vaccines based on inactivated or attenuated whole viral particles is among them. Here, we describe
the establishment of a workflow based on shotgun tandem mass spectrometry data to guide the
optimisation of the conditions for viral amplification. In parallel, we analysed the dynamic of the host
cell proteome following SARS-CoV-2 infection providing a global overview of biological processes
modulated by the virus and that could be further explored to identify drug targets to address the
pandemic.

Introduction
SARS-CoV-2 belongs to the B lineage of the beta‐coronaviruses and is closely related to the SARS‐CoV
virus [1,2]. It is the causative agent of COVID-19, a severe acute respiratory syndrome that spread
world-wide within a few weeks starting on December 2019 in Wuhan [3]. The major four structural
genes encode the nucleocapsid protein (N), the spike protein (S), a small membrane protein (SM) and
the membrane glycoprotein (M) with an additional membrane glycoprotein (HE) occurring in the
HCoV‐OC43 and HKU1 beta‐coronaviruses [3].
Based on the speed at which the outbreak of COVID-19 has developed, SARS-CoV-2 appears to spread
easily in the human population. The reproductive number (R0) of the virus is currently thought to be
around 3, suggesting the potential for sustained human-to-human transmission that appears to be
through respiratory droplets and potentially a fecal-oral route [4]. In this pandemic situation, one of
the outstanding questions concerns the possibility to contain the spread of SARS-CoV-2 and its
persistence in the human population. Social distancing policy, lock-down and other containment
measures have been worldwide implemented to slow down the spread. Current roadmaps to lifting
the restrictions rely on the deployment of effective diagnostics, therapies, and eventually on the
development of an effective vaccine.
Several platforms are being used to develop vaccines against SARS-CoV-2, including spike subunit,
DNA, RNA, whole-virion, and nanoparticle vaccines. Most successful antiviral vaccines employ
inactivated or attenuated whole viral particles as vaccine antigen and depend on the induction of
neutralizing antibodies [5,6] against structural proteins of the virus. However, virus yields from the
dedicated cell culture systems could be relatively low compared to quantities envisioned to be
required for massive vaccine production. In addition, the production campaigns are time-consuming
and highly demanding due to the danger of working with these pathogens, and thus optimization of
the production of whole viral particle antigen is of utmost interest for vaccines. Concomitantly with
vaccine development, a better understanding of how the host responds to SARS-CoV-2 infection may
help direct further therapeutic avenues.
Multiple proteomics strategies have been shown insightful for better understanding of coronavirus
structure and its molecular mechanisms of infection. Tracheal tissues of chicken infected with
infectious bronchitis coronavirus were analyzed by 2D-DIGE and MALDI-TOF tandem mass
spectrometry to establish the host response [7]. Vero cells infected with porcine epidemic diarrhea
virus (PEDV) were analyzed by shotgun proteomics [8]. Different PEDV coronavirus strains were
compared with an iTRAQ-labeling quantitative approach showing differences of inflammatory cascade
eliciting [9]. The dynamics of the host proteins triggered by specific overexpressed coronavirus genes
was also established [10]. While no literature is yet available on the proteomics characterization of

SARS-CoV-2 virus, several studies of interest have been recently submitted and should be soon
available [11,12,13].
Here, we describe the establishment of a workflow based on shotgun tandem mass spectrometry data
that in addition to gaining more basic information about SARS-CoV-2 infection aims at guiding the
optimisation of the conditions for whole viral particle antigen production and aiding SARS-CoV-2
vaccine development.

Materials and Methods
Cell culture and Virus preparation
Vero E6 (ATCC, CLR-1586) cells were cultured at 37°C in 9% CO2 in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium
(DMEM, Gibco™, ThemoFisher) supplemented with 5% fetal calf serum (FCS) and 0.5% penicillin–
streptomycin. Cells were passaged by trypsinization every 2 days. The SARS-CoV-2 strains 2019nCoV/Italy-INMI1 (Genbank MT066156) was provided by the Lazzaro Spallanzani National Institute of
Infectious Diseases (Rome, Italy) via the EVAg network (European Virus Archive goes global). SARSCoV-2 stocks used in the experiments had undergone two passages on Vero E6 cells and were stored
at -80°C. Virus titer was determined by standard plaque assay (1x107 pfu/ml).

Infection
For the kinetic, 1x106 Vero cells seeded into 25 cm2 flasks were grown to cell confluence in 5 mL DMEM
supplemented with 5% FCS and 0.5% penicillin–streptomycin for one night at 37°C under 9% CO2. They
were infected at two multiplicities of infection (MOI): 0.01 and 0.001. Cells were harvested at 1, 2, 3,
4, and 7 days post infection (dpi). Supernatants of SARS-CoV-2 infected cells were saved for plaque
assay titration to confirm production of infectious viral particles. Infected Vero cells were
microscopically observed for cytopathic effect (CPE) at the same time points.

Quantification of viral RNA by qRT-PCR
SARS-CoV-2 RNA from cell culture supernatant samples and supernatant plus cells was isolated using
the NucleoSpin RNA Virus, Mini kit for viral RNA from cell-free fluids (Macherey Nagel) according to
the manufacturer’s instructions. RNA was subjected to qRT-PCR analysis using the SuperScript III
Platinum One-Step qRT-PCR Kit (ThermoFisher) and a CFX96 Touch Real-Time PCR Detection System
Thermal Cycler (BioRad). Primers targeting IP2 and IP4 (RdRp) were as recommended [14]: nCoV_IP212669Fw

the RdRp and E gene as positive strand. Each microtube contains 1011 copies of target sequences
diluted in presence of yeast tRNAs, and lyophilised. Mean and standard deviation were calculated for
each group (n=3).

Sample preparation for mass spectrometry
At each of various time points, SARS-CoV-2 -infected Vero cells were washed twice with 5 ml of PBS to
remove media and FCS used to culture the cells. A volume of 1.5 ml of PBS was added to the washed
cells before harvesting. The virus was inactivated and the cells lysed by autoclaving the samples at
125°C for 40 min. Proteins were precipitated by adding cold trichloroacetic acid to a final concentration
of 10% (w/v). After an incubation of 5 min at 4 °C, the precipitated material was recovered by
centrifugation at 16000 xg for 10 min. The proteins in the resulting pellets were then dissolved in 100
μL LDS 1X (Lithium dodecyl sulfate) sample buffer (Invitrogen) and supplemented with 5% betamercaptoethanol (vol/vol) before sonication with a Hielscher UP50H disruptor operated for 20 sec at
60% amplitude with 0.25 sec impulsions and then incubation for 5 min at 99°C. A 20 µl aliquot of a 1/8
dilution in LDS 1X (invitrogen) of each sample was loaded on NuPAGE 4–12% Bis-Tris gel and subjected
to short SDS-PAGE migration. The proteins were stained for 5 min with Coomassie SimplyBlue SafeStain
(Thermo Fisher Scientific) prior in-gel trypsin proteolysis performed as described in Hartmann et al.
[15].

Liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry
Peptides were identified using an ultimate 3000 nano-LC system (Thermo Fisher Scientific) coupled
with a Q-Exactive HF mass spectrometer (Thermo Fisher Scientific). Peptides were desalted on a
reversed-phase PepMap 100 C18 μ-precolumn (5 μm, 100 Å, 300 μm i.d. × 5 mm, Thermo Fisher
Scientific) before peptide separation on a nanoscale PepMap 100 C18 nanoLC column (3 μm, 100 Å, 75
μm i.d. × 50 cm, Thermo Fisher Scientific) at a flow rate of 0.2 μL per min using a 120 min gradient
comprising 100 min from 4% to 25% of solvent B and 20 min from 25% to 40% of solvent B (solvent A
consisted in 0.1% formic acid in water, solvent B was 80% acetonitrile, 0.1% formic acid in water). The
mass spectrometer was operated in Top20 mode. Full MS were acquired from 350 to 1,500 m/z and
the 20 most abundant precursor ions were selected for fragmentation with 10 s dynamic exclusion
time. Ions with 2+ and 3+ charge were selected for MS/MS analysis. Secondary ions were isolated with
a window of 2.0 m/z.

MS/MS Data Interpretation and label free protein quantification
The MS/MS spectra recorded on each sample were assigned to peptide sequences using the Mascot
Server 2.5.1 (Matrix Science). A database (20,585 sequences; 10,847,418 residues) containing the
UniProt Chlorocebus sequences (downloaded March 2020) and the Italy-INMI1 SARS-CoV-2 protein
sequences was queried after a first analysis to remove contaminant spectra against an in-house
‘common contaminants’ database (384 sequences; 187,250 residues) encompassing 361 contaminants
classically observed in proteomics (cRAP + additional contaminants) and 23 Bos taurus sequences
corresponding to the most abundant proteins from foetal calf serum present in the cell culture medium
[16]. Peptide-to-MS/MS spectrum assignation was done with the following parameters: full trypsin
specificity, maximum of two missed cleavages, mass tolerances on the parent ion of 5 ppm and 0.02
Da on the MS/MS, static modification of carbamidomethylated cysteine (+57.0215), and oxidized
methionine (+15.9949) and deamidation of asparagine and glutamine (+0.984016) as dynamic
modifications. Mascot DAT files were parsed using the Python version of Matrix Science msparser
version 2.5.1 with function ms_peptidesummary. Peptide-to-Spectrum Matches (PSMs) with the
expectation values corresponding to 1% False Discovery Rate (FDR) were validated using the MASCOT
homology threshold option. Multiple PSMs per MS/MS spectra were allowed in case of ion scores
higher than 98% of the top ion score. Proteins were grouped if they shared at least one peptide, and
in each group label-free quantification was based on PSM counts for each protein following the
principle of parsimony. Proteins identified by one or more specific peptides were retained for the
analysis (protein FDR 1%).

MS/MS data repository.
The mass spectrometry proteomics data have been deposited to the ProteomeXchange Consortium
via the PRIDE [17] partner repository with the dataset identifier PXD018594 and 10.6019/PXD018594.

Data analysis
Principal component analysis was done as previously described [18]. Co-expression cluster analysis
was obtained using the Bioconductor R package coseq v1.5.2 [19]. The protein abundance matrix was
used as an input in coseqR. Log CLR-transformation was applied to the matrix to normalize the
abundance of proteins and the K-means algorithm was chosen to detect the co-expressed clusters
across the different time points. The K-mean algorithm was repeated 20 times in order to determine
the optimal number of clusters. The resulting number of clusters in each run was recorded, and the
most parsimonious cluster partition was selected using the slope heuristics approach. Both the PCA
and the coseq analysis were performed after removal of proteins with spectral counts lower than three

(1402 host protein groups retained). Finally, proteins assigned to the different clusters were retained
for cluster visualization and gene ontology (GO)-enrichment analysis per each cluster. Statistically
enriched (FDR ≤ 0.05) GO terms on proteins that are differentially expressed between pairwise samples
or on proteins assigned to each co-expression cluster were identified using Metascape [20]. The most
statistically enriched GO terms were visualized in ggplot2 [21].

Results
Profiling of virus production by tandem mass spectrometry
To understand the dynamics associated with SARS-CoV-2 infection and determine optimal conditions
for whole-viral particle antigen production we infected Vero E6 cells with SARS-CoV-2 at two
multiplicity of infection (MOI 0.01 and 0.001) and monitored the kinetics of the infection by means of
tandem mass spectrometry over several days (Figure 1). Overall, we identified 3220 Vero cell proteins
and 6 SARS-CoV-2 proteins with 27388 and 94 unique peptides (FDR below 1%), respectively (Table
S1). Among the identified viral proteins, three (N, S, M) out of the four encoded by the viral genome
were structural proteins while three were non-structural ones. In particular, out of the sixteen nonstructural proteins we identified peptides corresponding to the ORF1a papain-like protease (PLpro) /
3C-like protease (3CLpro) and to the accessory proteins encoded by ORF3a and ORF7a. These protein
sequences were covered with 40 (N), 29 (S), 7 (M), 13 (ORF1ab), 4 (ORF3a), and 1 (ORF7a) distinct
peptides. The sequence coverage of these polypeptides depends on their abundance, size, and lysine
and arginine residues occurrence, the ORF7a protein with 121 residues being logically poorly detected
compared to the others. Based on the sets of peptides shared by the different proteins, 2984 protein
groups were identified, for which a total of 457,111 PSMs were assigned. The viral proteins
represented 1.4% of these PSMs.
The dynamics of viral protein levels across time points indicated that SARS-CoV-2 protein synthesis
increased continuously after infection with a peak registered around day 3 post infection. Viral
amplification was slightly delayed in cells infected at a MOI of 0.001 (Figure 2A). SARS-CoV-2 N, S, and
M were consistently among the most abundant proteins detected. Their respective ratios were
relatively constant along time. Decline in abundance of viral proteins registered at 7 days post infection
was in accordance to notable cytopathic effect following intense virus replication observed here for
each culture at this time-point, as previously reported [22].
As expected, a larger variety of peptides was found for overrepresented proteins. Figure 2B shows the
distribution of this diversity across the time points for the three most abundant viral proteins.
Interestingly, increase of protein levels relied on increasing abundance of the same set of peptides

with only few new sequences registered at the peak of viral production compared with an early time
point.
To evaluate to what extent virus profiles obtained by tandem mass spectrometry reflected virus
production we measured SARS-CoV-2 RNA molecules by quantitative PCR analysis across the same
time points (Figure 2C). Variations in most abundant viral protein yields reflected variation in the
number of SARS-CoV–2 RNA molecules confirming that LC-MS/MS with label-free quantitation can be
applied to monitor SARS-CoV-2 infection kinetics.

Characterization of host cell protein dynamics upon SARS-CoV-2 infection
Next, we characterized changes in cellular protein networks upon SARS-CoV-2 infection at the level of
total protein abundance. Dimension reduction by principal component analysis (PCA) showed that
early and late time points were distinctively distributed along principal components 1 and 2, with
replicates clustering closely. This was observed for both MOI. Interestingly, a degree of overlap was
observed for time points J3 and J4 corresponding to the peak of viral protein abundance implying a
smaller evolution of the host proteome between these time points (Figure 3A). Addition of the viral
proteins measured at each time point did not affect samples separation. To elucidate the host
response during virus amplification, we performed a co-expression cluster analysis to determine host
proteins showing similar profiles over time (Figure 3B). Functional enrichment analysis performed on
the members of each cluster provided a global overview of biological processes (Figure 4A-C). At MOI
0.01, clusters 2 and 5, with 345 and 198 detected protein members, respectively, showed a close
similarity of the statistically enriched terms, with functions and pathways related to the viral life cycle
among the most represented ones. Besides, as revealed by functional interaction network analysis
even cluster-specific enriched functions like membrane trafficking and protein pre-processing in
endoplasmatic reticulum and regulation of mRNA processing/splicing via spliceosome, respectively,
were highly interconnected (Figure 4A-B). Also, an overlap of enriched biological functions was
observed for clusters 3 and 6, with 16 and 10 representatives, respectively, characterized by a specific
increase in the abundance of clustered proteins 3 days post-infection, with proteins involved in
cornification and ECM regulators (Extra Cellular Matrix) among the top 20 significantly enriched terms
(Figure 4A). Four distinct expression profiles were identified at MOI 0.001 (Figure 3B). Comparative
analysis and inference of enriched biological pathways revealed a significant enrichment of functions
related to host responses to the viral replication in cluster 2 and 3, with clathrin-mediated endocytosis
(R-HSA-8856828) and vesicle-mediated transport (R-HSA-5653656) pathways specific of the former
one (Figure 4D) and likely involved in vacuole formation and viral budding. Interestingly, similar to
cluster 2 obtained at higher MOI, the expression profiles of the members of these clusters are similar
to the dynamics of the viral protein levels across the kinetics. Clusters 4 (MOI 0.01) and 3 (MOI 0.001)

were enriched in pathways and biological functions related to the host central metabolism with the
metabolism of RNA and translation among the top enriched pathways. Despite the temporal
expression profiles of the proteins belonging to these clusters are not characterised by major changes,
their remodelling by the virus and a major effect on their abundance at earlier time points (<24 hours)
cannot be excluded.

Discussion
In the race to develop a vaccine for fighting the global spreading of SARS-CoV-2, different technology
platforms have been evaluated [23]. In this context, the obtainment of vaccines based on inactivated
or attenuated whole viral particles could be challenged in the finding of the right conditions for virus
amplification. Virus yields from the dedicated cell culture systems could also represent a limitation.
Concomitantly with vaccine development, inactivated virus particles are also of interest for testing real
serology or screening neutralizing antibodies. Evidently, production of well-characterized active virus
particles is also of interest for fundamental research purposes. Given the requirement for speed, here
we evaluate the use of LC-MS/MS as a tool for guiding the optimisation of the conditions for SARSCoV-2 whole viral particle antigen production.
The results presented here demonstrate the potential of our pipeline to profile virus production across
time. In particular, by analysing the proteome of Vero cells infected with SARS-CoV-2 at two different
MOI, it was possible to monitor changes in the levels of three SARS-CoV-2 structural proteins and three
non-structural ones. Whilst as for other analyses [11,13] we could not detect peptides from protein E
like. The lack of detection of other accessory proteins could be imputed to differences in samples
processing with the protocol described here favouring simplified steps and speed while maintaining
accuracy. Deeper analyses are envisaged for monitoring virus homogeneity during the different steps
of viral production once the most permissive conditions will be established.
Remarkably, comparable profiles were obtained at the two tested MOI, with the profiles obtained at
lower MOI slightly delayed and hence more insightful regarding the timing of the burst in the
abundance of viral levels.
Overrepresented proteins were described by a larger variety of peptides. Interestingly, an increase of
protein levels relied on the increasing abundance of the same set of peptides with only a few new
sequences registered at late time points suggesting that absolute quantification of the virus could be
obtained by targeted approaches by following early detectable peptides. Eventually tandem mass
spectrometry proteotyping [24,25] could be also proposed to detect SARS-CoV-2 viruses.
Besides profiling virus production, our mass spectrometry analysis of the whole cell content provides
insights regarding the cellular response to SARS-CoV–2 infection. Notwithstanding, while more

detailed information is available regarding virus cell entry, increased understanding of the different
steps in the SARS-CoV-2 replication cycle are needed [26]. To our knowledge, this is one of the first
attempt to characterize cellular response to infection with SARS-CoV–2 in Vero E6 cells. Interestingly,
such proteomics data can be acquired on different cell lines from humans and primates in order to
define by comparative proteomics the common mechanisms of cell infection and the mechanisms
specific of a given cell line.
The analysis of our proteomic data suggested substantial temporal remodelling of the host proteome
over the time points. Functional enrichment analysis of clusters of proteins showing similar expression
profiles highlight key pathways during virus replication providing a potential target for effective
therapeutics against coronaviruses rises. Consistently with the pathways identified by Bojkova et al.
[11] by using the human colon epithelial carcinoma cell line Caco–2 as system for the analysis of SARSCoV-2 replication, we identified clusters of proteins increased by infection and enriched in RNA
modifiers, such as spliceosome components, and carbon metabolism, further supporting the
preliminary evidence that classifies splicing as an essential pathway for SARS-CoV–2 replication and
potential therapeutic target. Additional clusters of proteins identified in our analysis highlighted the
regulation of pathways critical for the virus life cycle like those involved in protein pre-processing in
the endoplasmatic reticulum, vacuole formation and viral budding.
Here, we show that our pipeline based on LC-MS/MS analysis is a suitable tool for the characterisation
of SARS-CoV-2 production. We, therefore, suggest that it could be of use in the optimisation of the
condition for viral amplification to speed up the initial steps in favour of those that later on during the
development process will require a more careful evaluation of effectiveness and safety.
Besides, peptide information described here provide sufficient information to enable a targeted
analysis, opening the possibility of using mass spectrometry-based targeted approaches for the
evaluation of critical aspects (i.e. quality and quantity) during the different steps of the virus
purification processes. Furthermore, the characterized changes in cellular protein networks upon
SARS-CoV-2 infection provided valuable insights that could be further explored and guide the
identification of drug targets to address the pandemic caused by SARS-CoV-2.
We can anticipate that the same workflow could be successfully applied to expedite the
characterisation of human organ-on-a-chip (Organ Chip) microfluidic culture devices used to obtain
insights on the different steps of the virus life cycle as well as to study human disease pathogenesis
[27] in response to infection by variants of SARS-Cov-2 under or not the addition of existing [28,29,30]
and novel therapeutics.

Figure legend

Figure 1. Schematic representation of the experimental design. Vero E6 cells were infected at Day 0
with SARS-CoV-2 at two multiplicity of infection (MOI 0.01 and 0.001). The kinetics of the infection
was monitored by means of tandem mass spectrometry over several days. The main steps and the
output of the analysis are highlighted.

Figure 2. Virus profiling by tandem mass spectrometry. (A) Kinetic of viral production by LC-MS/MS.
Relative abundance at each time points represents the mean ± standard deviation of the technical
replicates at the two MOI tested. Dashed curves indicate results obtained at MOI 0.01 while solid
curves refer to MOI 0.001. (B) Comparison between viral peptides identified at the different time
points. Sets of intersections are visualized using the UpSet matrix layout and plotted horizontally. Each
column corresponds to an exclusive intersection that contains the elements of the sets represented
by the dark circles. Sets are represented by the different peptides assigned to viral proteins at each
time point. J2, J3, J4 and J7 refer to the different time points analysed: Day 2, 3, 4 and 7, respectively.
(C) Correlation between viral counts (copies/mL) obtained by qRT-PCR and the abundance of viral
proteins measured by LC-MS/MS across time points. Dashed curves indicate results obtained at MOI
0.01 while solid curves refer to MOI 0.001.

Figure 3. Host response upon SARS-CoV-2 infection. (A) Dimension reduction by principal component
analysis (PCA) of the different time points at MOI 0.01 and 0.001, respectively. Normalised abundance
of proteins with Spectral Count >3 was used as input. J1, J2, J3, J4 and J7 refer to the different time
points analysed, Day 2, 3, 4 and 7, respectively. (B) Clusters of proteins showing similar expression
profiles over time. J1, J2, J3, J4 and J7 refer to the different time points analysed, Day 2, 3, 4 and 7,
respectively. The number on the top of each plot identifies the cluster.

Figure 4. Host pathways dysregulated by the infection. (A-C) Heatmap showing the top enrichment
clusters, one row per cluster, using a discrete color scale to represent statistical significance. Gray color
indicates a lack of significance. MOI 0.01(A) and 0.001 (C). (B-D) Enrichment network visualization for
results from the proteins present in each of the identified clusters. Nodes are represented by pie charts
indicating their associations with each cluster. Color code represents the clusters. At MOI 0.01 (B), red
represents Cluster 1 while blue, green, purple and orange refer to Cluster 2, 3, 5 and 6, respectively.
At MOI 0.001 (D), red indicates Cluster 1 while blue and green refer to Cluster 2 and 4, respectively.
