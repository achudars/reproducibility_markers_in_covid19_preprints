Abstract

10

Background

11

When a virus that has grown in a nonhuman host starts an epidemic in the human

12

population, human cells may not provide growth conditions ideal for the virus.

13

Therefore, the invasion of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-

14

CoV-2), which is usually prevalent in the bat population, into the human population is

15

thought to have necessitated changes in the viral genome for efficient growth in the new

16

environment. In the present study, to understand host-dependent changes in coronavirus

17

genomes, we focused on the mono- and oligonucleotide compositions of SARS-CoV-2

18

genomes and investigated how these compositions changed time-dependently in the

19

human cellular environment. We also compared the oligonucleotide compositions of

20

SARS-CoV-2 and other coronaviruses prevalent in humans or bats to investigate the

21

causes of changes in the host environment.

22

Results

23

Time-series analyses of changes in the nucleotide compositions of SARS-CoV-2

24

genomes revealed a group of mono- and oligonucleotides whose compositions changed

25

in a common direction for all clades, even though viruses belonging to different clades

26

should evolve independently. Interestingly, the compositions of these oligonucleotides

changed towards those of coronaviruses that have been prevalent in humans for a long

28

period and away from those of bat coronaviruses.

29

Conclusions

30

Clade-independent, time-dependent changes are thought to have biological significance

31

and should relate to viral adaptation to a new host environment, providing important

32

clues for understanding viral host adaptation mechanisms.

Background

39

Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2), an RNA virus

40

belonging to the betacoronavirus genus, began to spread in the human population in

41

2019. This viral strain is believed to have been originally prevalent in bats and

42

transferred to the human population through intermediate hosts [1]. Viral growth

43

requires a wide variety of host factors (nucleotide pools, proteins, RNA, etc.) and

44

should evade the diverse antiviral mechanisms of host cells (antibodies, killer T cells,

45

interferon, RNA interference, etc.) [2-4]. Since ancestral SARS-CoV-2 strains are

46

thought to be endemic in bats, they should be well adapted to their host environment;

47

when the virus invades the human population, human cells may not provide growth

48

conditions ideal for the virus. For efficient growth and rapid spread of the infection,

49

changes in the viral genome should be required. Analyses of time-dependent changes in

50

SARS-CoV-2 in the human population can be used to characterize how and why viral

51

genomes change to adapt to a new host environment.

52
53

Due to the great threat of COVID-19 and remarkable development of
sequencing technology, a massive number of SARS-CoV-2 genome sequences are

54

available in databases, even though the epidemic has lasted for approximately 10

55

months. These sequence data have provided a wide range of insights into SARS-CoV-2

56

[5,6]. Phylogenetic methods based on sequence alignment have been widely used in

57

molecular evolution studies [7,8], and these methods are well refined and essential for

58

studying phylogenetic relationships between different viral species and variations in the

59

same viral species at the single-nucleotide level. However, when dealing with a massive

60

number of genome sequences, methods based on sequence alignment become

61

problematic because they require a large amount of computational resources.

62

We have continued to develop sequence alignment-free methods focused on

63

the oligonucleotide compositions of genome sequences [9-12]. Notably, oligonucleotide

64

composition varies widely among species, including viruses, and is designated as

65

genome signatures [13]. These compositions can be treated as numerical data, and a

66

massive amount of sequence data can easily be subjected to various statistical analyses.

67

Furthermore, even genomic fragments without orthologous and/or paralogous pairs can

68

be compared [11,12,14-17]. Specifically, our previous work on influenza A-type virus

69

genomes found that the oligonucleotide compositions of the viral genomes differed

70

between hosts (e.g., humans and birds), even for viruses within the same subtype (e.g.,

71

H1N1 and H3N2 of type A) [11,12,14]; we also examined changes in the

72

oligonucleotide compositions of influenza H1N1/09, which have been epidemic in

73

humans beginning in 2009, and found that their compositions changed to approach

74

those of the seasonal flu strains H1N1 and H3N2 [11]. Furthermore, although epidemics

75

of the H1N1 and H3N2 strains began several decades apart, these strains showed highly

76

similar chronological changes from the start of these epidemics. These evolutionary yet

77

reproducible changes suggest that mutations to adapt to a new host environment

78

inevitably accumulate when the host species of a virus changes, and these changes can

79

be efficiently detected by analyzing oligonucleotide compositions.

Several groups, including ours, have examined changes in SARS-CoV-2

80
81

genomes during the early stages of the SARS-CoV-2 epidemic and found clear

82

directional changes in a group of mono- and oligonucleotides detectable on even a

83

monthly basis [15,18,19]. These directional changes will allow us to predict changes in

84

the near future. Notably, near-future prediction and verification should be the most

85

direct ways to test the reliability of the obtained results, models and ideas (e.g., those

86

discovered for influenza viruses), providing a new paradigm for molecular evolutionary

87

studies. In this context, the present study analyzed the genome sequences of over

88

seventy thousand SARS-CoV-2 strains isolated from December 2019 to September

89

2020.

92

Results

93

Directional changes in the mononucleotide compositions (%) of SARS-CoV-2

94

For fast-evolving RNA viruses, diversity within the viral population arises rapidly as

95

the epidemic progresses and subpopulation structure forms; the GISAID consortium has

96

defined at least seven main clades (G, GH, GR, L, V, S and Others). Notably, the

97

elementary processes of molecular evolution are based on random mutations, and

98

strains belonging to different clades are thought to have evolved independently.

99

Therefore, the observation of highly similar time-dependent changes independent of

100

clade has certain biological meanings and may be inevitable for efficient growth in

101

human cells. From this perspective, we first examined time-dependent changes in the

102

mononucleotide compositions (%) of SARS-CoV-2 strains isolated from December

103

2019 to September 2020.

104

Among the seven clades (G, GH, GR, L, V, S and Others) reported by the

105

GISAID consortium, we used six clades (G, GH, GR, L, V and S), excluding Others, in

106

the analysis. For the time-series analysis, we calculated the average mononucleotide

107

compositions (%) of the genomes in each clade collected monthly; in Fig. 1A, the

108

mononucleotide composition of each clade is shown as a colored line, while that for the

109

monthly collected genomes belonging to all clades is shown as a dashed line.

110

Regardless of clade, the composition of C decreased, while that of U increased

111

in a time-dependent manner, but the changes in A and G composition were less clear

112

(Fig. 1A). Correlation coefficients between the mononucleotide composition and month

113

from the start of the epidemic showed a high negative correlation for C and a high

114

positive correlation for U for all clades, but there was no clear directionality for A and

115

G (Fig. 1A and Tables 1, 2). These results indicate that the mononucleotide composition

116

of this virus may be prone to biased mutations that reduce C and increase U or the

117

mutated strains tend to be more favorable for growth in human cells.

118
119

Directional changes in short oligonucleotide compositions

120

Oligonucleotides are known to act as functional motifs, such as binding sites for a wide

121

variety of proteins and target sites for RNA modifications. Therefore, directional

122

changes in some oligonucleotides independent of clade may relate to certain processes

123

for adaptation to the new host environment. Our previous work on influenza A viruses

124

found that their oligonucleotide compositions varied among prevalent hosts [11,12];

125

notably, although influenza virus isolated from humans tended to prefer A and U (but

126

not G and C) more than viruses isolated from birds, the human viruses showed a

127

preference for GGCG and GGGG, which are G- or C-rich. Importantly, there are

128

various examples of oligonucleotides whose changes in composition cannot be

129

explained by changes in mononucleotide composition alone, and these changes may

130

relate to the molecular mechanisms of viral adaptation to a new host.

131

From this perspective, we next analyzed time-dependent changes in di- and

132

trinucleotide compositions and found that a group of di- and trinucleotides showed a

133

highly positive or negative correlation (Figs. 1B, S1 and Tables 1, 2). Interestingly, a

5

134

group of A- or G-rich oligonucleotides, such as GAG and GGA, showed a high positive

135

correlation independent of clade, which was not expected from the changes in

136

mononucleotide compositions alone. To confirm the extent of these changes, we also

137

calculated the fold change in composition for the first isolated month and the last

138

examined month (Fig. 2) and found clear increases and decreases in mono- and

139

oligonucleotide compositions common among the six clades, which supports the result

140

presented in Fig. 1 and Tables 1 and 2.

141
142

Changes towards the sequences of other coronaviruses prevalent in humans

143

In a previous study of SARS-CoV-2 [16], we analyzed mono- and dinucleotide

144

compositions for the first four epidemic months without separating the sequences by

145

clade. Notably, the directional changes shown in Figs. 1 and 2 and Tables 1 and 2 were

146

absolutely consistent with the previous results, even when the six clades were separately

147

analyzed. In the previous study, time-series analysis of ebolavirus at the beginning of

148

the epidemic in West Africa in 2014 also showed directional changes in a group of

149

mono- and dinucleotide compositions, but these directional increases/decreases tended

150

to slow approximately 10 months after the start of the epidemic. The increase/decrease

151

trend for SARS-CoV-2 is far from slowing after 10 months, and the next important

152

questions are how long these directional changes in this virus will last and whether there

153

are possible goals to these changes.

154

To conduct this near-future prediction, the following information concerning

155

influenza viruses should be useful. As mentioned before, mono- and oligonucleotide

156

compositions in influenza H1N1/09 changed towards those of seasonal influenza strains

157

such as the H1N1 and H3N2 subtypes [11]. Furthermore, all the human subtypes

158

showed directional changes away from the compositions of all avian influenza A

159

subtypes and closer to those of the human influenza B type, which has been prevalent

160

only in humans [14]. If we assume that changes similar to those in the influenza virus

6

161

will occur, the mono- and oligonucleotide compositions of interest for SARS-CoV-2 are

162

expected to change towards those of other coronaviruses that have been prevalent in

163

humans and away from those of coronaviruses prevalent in bats. To test this hypothesis,

164

we analyzed the following coronaviruses: 238 human-CoV strains (alphacoronaviruses

165

229E and NL63: betacoronaviruses HKU1 and OC43) and 166 bat-CoV strains

166

(alphacoronaviruses and betacoronaviruses, including the SARS virus).

167

As shown in Fig. 3A, we compared the mononucleotide compositions of

168

SARS-CoV-2 with those of the human- and bat-CoV strains; the data for bat SARS

169

among bat-CoV strains, which is thought to be the original strain that caused the current

170

COVID-19 pandemic, are marked in pink. Interestingly, concerning the human- and

171

bat-CoV strains, differences in mononucleotide composition were more pronounced

172

between hosts than between the alpha and beta linages, and the levels for all six clades

173

of SARS-CoV-2 were between those for the two hosts. Fig. 3B shows the results of di-

174

and trinucleotides, for which the directional, time-dependent changes were primarily

175

common among the six clades. The increases and decreases in nucleotide composition

176

observed for SARS-CoV-2 in Figs. 1 and 2 are indicated by hollow up and down

177

arrows, respectively. Interestingly, all changes of interest tended to move away from the

178

compositions of bat SARS and approach those of human-CoV, supporting the view that

179

the directional changes of interest have biological significance and are possibly

180

inevitable, as observed for influenza viruses. Assuming that approaching the levels in

181

human-CoV strains is the hypothetical goal of the directional change of SARS-CoV-2,

182

the current compositions are far from this hypothetical goal (Fig. 3); therefore, we

183

predict that directional changes of interest will continue in the near future.

184

Then, assuming that the average value for all human-CoV strains is a

185

hypothetical goal, we investigated how SARS-CoV-2 has approached this possible goal.

186

Specifically, we calculated the square of the difference between the composition of each

187

nucleotide in SARS-CoV-2 and the average value for human-CoV strains and plotted

7

188

the values of the difference according to the elapsed month for each nucleotide.

189

Changes in the compositions of both C and U clearly reduced this difference, as the

190

compositions of these nucleotides approached the hypothetical goal (Fig. 4A); their

191

linear reduction supports the prediction that directional changes in the composition of C

192

and U will continue for the foreseeable future. In contrast, A and G did not show

193

directional changes in composition, which is most likely due to the absence of clear

194

differences in the A and G compositions of human- and bat-CoV, i.e., there is no

195

possible target (Fig. 3A). Fig. 4B shows examples of di- and trinucleotides whose

196

compositions have moved towards the hypothetical goal, but Fig. 4C shows a few

197

exceptional nucleotides whose compositions have not changed towards the hypothetical

198

goal but have changed with a common directionality among the six clades. In Fig. 4D,

199

correlation coefficients between the above difference and the elapsed month are

200

presented. Most nucleotides of interest showed a negative coefficient (i.e., a directional

201

change towards human-CoV), but three oligonucleotides, GG, AGC and CAU, showed

202

positive coefficients indicating an increase in the difference (i.e., moving away from the

203

human-CoV level). For these opposing directional changes, certain causes specific to

204

SARS-CoV-2 may be assumed.

205
206

Motifs for RNA-binding proteins

207

Next, we considered the mechanisms that move oligonucleotide compositions away

208

from those of bat coronaviruses and closer to those of human coronaviruses. Certain

209

human cellular factors involved in viral growth may be candidates in such mechanisms.

210

When considering possible protein factors, oligonucleotides longer than trinucleotides

211

should be a focus. As an attempt, we here focused on host RNA-binding proteins

212

because their binding to hepatitis C virus is known to be involved in the growth of this

213

RNA virus [20]. We thus searched for motifs for human RNA-binding proteins in

214

coronavirus genomes (see Methods section) and found multiple loci with binding motifs

215

for each protein. Table 3 (and Table S10) lists the motifs for which a directional time-

216

dependent change was primarily common among six clades. Table 3 and Fig. 5A show

217

that only ELAVL1 showed a positive correlation, but the other nine proteins in Table 3

218

showed a negative correlation for almost all clades; the results for other motifs are

219

presented in Table S12.

220

We next compared the numbers of these motifs in SARS-CoV-2 with the

221

numbers of human- and bat-CoV motifs (Fig. 5B). Of the ten proteins shown in Table 3,

222

the only elevated motif, that for ELAVL1 binding, was found in a significantly higher

223

number of loci in human-CoV than in bat-CoV, but motifs for PCBP2 and SRSF1

224

binding, which tended to decrease (Table 3), were found in significantly fewer loci in

225

human-CoV. These observations appear to be consistent with the features found in the

226

mono-, di- and trinucleotide compositions of interest. However, unlike these changes,

227

there was significant diversity within even a single clade, which appears to be greater

228

than the differences between hosts, with the possible exception of ELAVL1. In regard

229

to long oligonucleotides, they should carry out a variety of functions, and mutations that

230

accumulate in their functional motifs may have complex effects on the presence of

231

functional motif sequences, so an analysis from a new perspective appears to become

232

important.

233
234

Discussion

235

We first discuss possible molecular mechanisms related to time-dependent directional

236

changes in mononucleotide composition. Fig. 1A shows that the frequency of C tended

237

to decrease in SARS-CoV-2, while that of U tended to increase. Since a similar change

238

was previously found for MERS and all A-type influenza subtypes [12,14], these

239

changes may have biological significance for a wide range of RNA viruses that invade

240

from nonhuman hosts. One possible mechanism is the host RNA-editing function;

241

Simmonds (2020) proposed that the C→U hypermutation in SARS-CoV-2 may be due

242

to the influence of APOBEC family proteins in humans [19]. APOBEC is an antiviral

243

protein in various animal species, including humans, that can convert C to U by the

244

deacetylation of C [21-23]. Such RNA editing is also known to act as a defense

245

mechanism against various viruses, including retroviruses [24]. The APOBEC gene

246

family has generated various paralogs during mammalian evolution, with seven known

247

APOBEC genes in humans and ten in bat families [25-27]. The prevalence C→U

248

change in SARS-CoV-2 upon transfer of its host environment from bats to humans

249

suggests that these changes may be due to human-specific APOBEC genes.

250

We next discuss changes in short oligonucleotides. Directional changes in

251

some oligonucleotides, such as GAG and GGA, cannot be explained by APOBEC-

252

induced C→U mutations alone. Although the evidence is weak, these oligonucleotides

253

are part of the binding motifs of several RNA-binding proteins, such as SRSF1 and

254

PCBP2 (Table S9); the number of loci for these motifs has decreased independently of

255

clade. In contrast, the number of motif loci for only ELAVL1 among the ten proteins

256

listed in Table 3 has increased independently of clade. As an RNA-binding protein that

257

binds A- or U-rich elements, ELAVL1 binding to mRNA is known to contribute to

258

RNA stability [28, 29]; SARS-CoV-2 and human-CoV, which are prevalent in humans,

259

may contain increased binding motifs for ELAVL1 for efficient growth in the human

260

cellular environment. However, for further analysis, information on RNA-binding

261

proteins in bat cells is needed.

262
263

Conclusions

264

In the present study, we found that the compositions of a group of mono- and

265

oligonucleotide in SARS-CoV-2 genomes have changed in a host cell-dependent

266

manner. This is totally consistent to our previous finding for influenza A and B viruses

267

[11,12,14], supporting the previous prediction that the host-dependent directional

268

changes of various mono- and oligonucleotides should inevitably occur in zoonotic

RNA viruses that have invaded from nonhuman hosts. Phylogenetic methods based on

270

sequence alignment [7,8] are well refined and undoubtedly essential for studying the

271

phylogenetic relationships between viruses. The present alignment-free method to

272

analyze mono- and oligonucleotide compositions can also serve as a powerful tool for

273

molecular evolutionary studies of viruses, revealing directional changes in viruses and

274

predicting the possible goals of these changes.

Methods

278

SARS-CoV-2 genome sequences

279

Human SARS-CoV-2 genome sequences were downloaded from the GISAID database

280

(https://www.gisaid.org/); sequences that were complete, showed high coverage and had

281

been isolated from humans were downloaded on Sep 17, 2020. Among the acquired

282

sequences, strains with an unknown isolation month were excluded from the analysis,

283

and the polyA tail was removed. A list of all 72,314 strains used is provided in Table

284

S1.

285
286

Genome sequences of coronaviruses prevalent in humans or bats

287

The complete sequences of two types of human coronavirus (human-CoV) strains,

288

alphacoronaviruses (27 229E and 55 NL63 strains) and betacoronaviruses (18 HKU1

289

and 138 OC43 strains), were obtained from the NCBI virus database

290

(https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/labs/virus/). The complete genome sequences of two

291

types of bat coronavirus (bat-CoV) strains, alphacoronaviruses (87 strains) and

292

betacoronaviruses (79 strains, including 34 SARS-CoV), isolated from three types of

293

bats (Chiroptera, Vespertilionidae and Rhinolophidae) were obtained from the NCBI

294

virus database (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/labs/virus/), and the polyA tail of each

295

sequence was removed. The strains are listed in Table S2.

Time-series analysis of changes in oligonucleotide compositions

298

In the time-series analysis, the average mono- and oligonucleotide compositions (%) of

299

viruses collected in each month were calculated for each clade. To avoid statistical

300

fluctuations due to the small sample size, months in which fewer than 10 strains had

301

RNA-binding motif analysis

304

RNA-binding motifs were obtained from the ATtRACT database [30]. In this database,

305

multiple binding motifs are registered as corresponding to one RNA-binding protein;

306

we calculated the total number of loci containing the binding motifs for each protein in

307

the viral genomes.

Fig. 2. Fold changes in nucleotide composition between the epidemic start and the

358

last month of analysis. A bar plot shows the fold change in composition of each mono-

359

or oligonucleotide; this value was calculated by dividing the nucleotide composition in

360

the last month of analysis by that at the start of the epidemic. Each bar is colored to

361

indicate the clade, as described in Fig. 1. Since we analyzed strains belonging to

362

different clades separately, data from the first or last month differed among clades; see

363

also the Methods section.
