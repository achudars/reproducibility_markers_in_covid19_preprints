Abstract

24

Coronaviruses that infect humans belong to the Alpha-coronavirus (including

25

HCoV-229E) and Beta-coronavirus (including SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2) genera.

26

In particular, SARS-CoV-2 is currently a major threat to public health worldwide.

27

However, no commercial vaccines against the coronaviruses that can infect humans

28

are available. The spike (S) homotrimers bind to their receptors through the

29

receptor-binding domain (RBD), which is believed to be a major target to block viral

30

entry.

31

Beta-coronavirus (SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2) as models. Their RBDs were

32

observed to adopt two different conformational states (lying or standing). Then,

33

structural and immunological analyses were used to explore differences in the

34

immune response with RBDs among these coronaviruses. Our results showed that

35

more RBD-specific antibodies were induced by the S trimer with the RBD in the

36

“standing” state (SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2) than the S trimer with the RBD in

37

the “lying” state (HCoV-229E), and the affinity between the RBD-specific antibodies

38

and S trimer was also higher in the SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2. In addition, we

39

found that the ability of the HCoV-229E RBD to induce neutralizing antibodies was

40

much lower and the intact and stable S1 subunit was essential for producing efficient

41

neutralizing antibodies against HCoV-229E. Importantly, our results reveal different

42

vaccine strategies for coronaviruses, and S-trimer is better than RBD as a target for

43

vaccine development in Alpha-coronavirus. Our findings will provide important

44

implications for future development of coronavirus vaccines.

Importance

46

Outbreak of coronaviruses, especially SARS-CoV-2, poses a serious threat to

47

global public health. Development of vaccines to prevent the coronaviruses that can

48

infect humans has always been a top priority. Coronavirus spike (S) protein is

49

considered as a major target for vaccine development. Currently, structural studies

50

have shown that Alpha-coronavirus (HCoV-229E) and Beta-coronavirus (SARS-CoV

51

and SARS-CoV-2) RBDs are in lying and standing state, respectively. Here, we tested

52

the ability of S-trimer and RBD to induce neutralizing antibodies among these

53

coronaviruses. Our results showed that Beta-CoVs RBDs are in a standing state, and

54

their S proteins can induce more neutralizing antibodies targeting RBD. However,

55

HCoV-229E RBD is in a lying state, and its S protein induces a low level of

56

neutralizing antibody targeting RBD. Our results indicate that Alpha-coronavirus is

57

more conducive to escape host immune recognition, and also provide novel ideas for

58

the development of vaccines targeting S protein.

Introduction

60

Coronaviruses (CoVs) are enveloped, positive-sense, single-stranded RNA

61

viruses with the largest genomes (26-32 kb) among known RNA viruses and are

62

phylogenetically divided into four genera (Alpha-, Beta-, Gamma-, and Delta-CoV) (1,

63

2). To date, seven human-infecting coronaviruses (hCoVs) (3, 4) cause varying

64

degrees of symptoms: HCoV-229E, HCoV-NL63, HCoV-HKU1, HCoV-OC43, severe

65

acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV), Middle East respiratory

66

syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) and SARS-CoV-2, which is responsible for the

67

current outbreak of COVID-19. Among them, alpha-CoVs (HCoV-229E and

68

HCoV-NL63) and beta-CoVs (HCoV-OC43 and HCoV-HKU1) are well adapted to

69

humans and widely circulate in the human population, with most infections causing

70

mild disease in immunocompetent adults (3, 5, 6). In addition, SARS-CoV,

71

SARS-CoV-2 and MERS-CoV belong to Beta-CoV and are highly pathogenic (7-9).

72

SARS-CoV emerged in 2002 in the Guangdong Province of China and spread

73

worldwide, resulting in 8,273 infections and nearly 775 deaths in 37 countries, with

74

an approximately 9% case fatality rate (CFR) (7). MERS-CoV emerged in the Arabian

75

Peninsula in 2012 and caused numerous outbreaks in humans, with a CFR of

76

approximately 36% (10). SARS-CoV-2 is a new coronavirus strain that was first

77

reported in Wuhan, China (4). As of June 5, 2020, SARS-CoV-2 has resulted in a total

78

of 6,416,828 confirmed cases of COVID-19 worldwide and has caused 382,867

79

deaths (https://covid19.who.int/).

80

As the primary glycoprotein on the surface of the viral envelope, the spike (S)

81

glycoprotein is the major target of neutralizing antibodies (nAbs) elicited by natural

82

infection and key antigens in experimental vaccine candidates. The S protein contains

83

two subunits responsible for receptor binding (S1 subunit) and membrane fusion (S2

84

subunit) (11). In particular, the S1 subunit of the prefusion S protein is structurally

85

organized into four distinct domains: the N-terminal domain (NTD), the C-terminal

86

domain (CTD), subdomain 1 (SD1) and subdomain 2 (SD2) (12-24).The

87

receptor-binding domain (RBD) in the S protein mediates the binding of the virus to

88

host cells, which is a critical step for the virus to enter target cells (11, 25). The CTDs

89

of alpha-CoVs HCoV-NL63 and HCoV-229E are used as RBDs, which bind to

90

angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) and aminopeptidase (APN), respectively

91

(26, 27). The CTDs of beta-CoVs (SARS-CoV, SARS-CoV-2 and MERS-CoV) are

92

similar in their core structures but are markedly different in their receptor-binding

93

motifs (RBMs), leading to different receptor specificities; SARS-CoV and

94

SARS-CoV-2 recognize ACE2 (28, 29), whereas MERS-CoV recognizes dipeptidyl

95

peptidase-4 (DPP4) (30).

96

Cryo-electron microscopy (cryo-EM) studies have advanced our understanding

97

of the S protein during virus entry. The S-trimer structures in the prefusion state have

98

been reported for members of Alpha-CoVs (HCoV-NL63, HCoV-229E, porcine

99

epidemic diarrhea virus (PEDV), and feline infectious peritonitis (FIPV) (12, 14, 16,

100

21), Beta-CoVs (mouse hepatitis virus (MHV), HCoV-HKU1, HCoV-OC43,

101

SARS-CoV, SARS-CoV-2 and MERS-CoV) (13, 15, 19, 20, 22, 23), Gamma-CoV

102

(avian coronavirus (IBV)) (24), and Delta-CoV (porcine deltacoronavirus (PDCoV))

103

(17, 18). The S1 subunits of Beta- and Gamma-CoV strains utilize the cross-subunit

104

packing mode, reducing the conformational conflict of the RBD in a standing state

105

(13, 19, 20, 24). In contrast, Alpha- and Delta-CoV strains both utilize an intrasubunit

106

packing mode, and the S1-CTD is limited by the conformational conflict with

107

surrounding domains (12, 14, 16-18, 21, 24). Hence, the S1-RBD in the S trimer was

108

captured in two different states among different coronaviruses. In the Beta-CoVs

109

(SARS-CoV, SARS-CoV-2 and MERS-CoV), the S1-RBD adopts a “standing” state,

110

which is believed to be a prerequisite for receptor binding and RBM-specific antibody

111

binding (13, 19, 20). Nevertheless, the S1-RBDs of alpha-CoVs all adopt “lying” state,

112

which is considered more conducive to evading antibody recognition (12, 14, 16, 21).

113

Currently, no approved vaccines and drugs against the hCoVs are available. Past

114

efforts, including the development of inactivated virus vaccines (31, 32),

115

live-attenuated virus vaccines (33, 34), viral vector vaccines (35-37), subunit vaccines

116

(38-40), DNA vaccines (41, 42), nanoparticle- (43) and virus-like particle

117

(VLP)-based vaccines (44), were mainly focused on SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV.

118

Compared with other vaccine types, subunit vaccines are target-specific and can

119

generate high-titer nAbs without disadvantages, including viral infection, concerns of

120

incomplete inactivation, virulence recovery and potential harmful immune responses.

121

A number of subunit vaccines have been developed against SARS-CoV and

122

MERS-CoV. Among them, the S protein or RBD was the major targets (45-47).

123

Compared with Beta-CoVs, relatively few studies have investigated two

124

alpha-hCoVs: HCoV-229E and HCoV-NL63. However, their S1 subunit structure and

125

receptor recognition pattern, especially the structure of the RBD and its state in the S

126

trimer, differ substantially from those of beta-CoVs, suggesting different S protein

127

immune responses between alpha- and beta-CoVs. Importantly, considering the low

128

homology between different coronavirus genera, related research on alpha-CoVs can

129

not only help to elucidate the differences between S proteins that adopt different RBD

130

states but can also facilitate the development of coronavirus vaccines. In this study,

131

we selected SARS-CoV, SARS-CoV-2, and HCoV-229E as models, which adopt the

132

two RBD states, and evaluated and compared immune responses to the S trimers and

133

RBDs of these coronaviruses through immunological and bioinformatics approaches.

134

We also investigated the mechanism through which the HCoV-229E S trimer

135

produced effective nAbs. Finally, we provide possible vaccine strategies for alpha-

136

and beta-CoVs, which may facilitate the design and development of coronavirus

137

vaccines in the future.

138

Results and discussion

139

Structural and immunological analyses of coronaviruses spike proteins

140

To date, many S-trimer structures of coronaviruses have been resolved (12-14,

141

16-24). Through structural comparison, we found an interesting phenomenon.

142

Although the amino acid sequences are quite different, the compositions and

143

structures of different functional domains of coronaviruses are similiar (Fig. 1A). All

144

the alpha-CoVs bind to protein receptors with CTDs (as receptor binding domains

145

(RBDs)), and the RBDs are in a lying state (12, 14, 16, 21, 26, 27) (Fig.1B). However,

146

beta-CoVs (SARS-CoV, SARS-CoV-2 and MERS-CoV) bind receptors with CTDs

147

(as RBDs), and the RBDs are in standing state (13, 19, 20) (Fig. 1B). Previous studies

148

have shown that the RBD, as an important functional domain that directly binds to

149

receptors, is an important target for the induction of nAbs (45-47). Hence, the

150

transition between these two states (lying and standing) may play an important role in

151

receptor binding and nAbs escape.

152

To address this issue, we performed B-cell epitope predictions for the S trimers

153

and RBDs of alpha-CoV (HCoV-229E) and beta-CoVs (SARS-CoV and

154

SARS-CoV-2). The predicted positive residues (the corresponding spatial epitope and

155

linear epitope) are displayed on the structural surface (Fig. 2A, 2C and 2E), and the

156

distribution of positive residues on the RBD is summarized in Table 1. A total of 51

157

and 26 amino acid residues located on the RBD were predicted to be conformational

158

epitopes for SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2, respectively. Of these, 47 and 25 residues

159

were located in the SARS-CoV RBM subdomain and in the SARS-CoV-2 RBM

160

subdomain, respectively. The linear B-cell epitope prediction results were similar in

161

SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2. However, in HCoV-229E, only 3 residues located in

162

the RBM subdomain were predicted to be conformational epitopes, and 9 residues

163

were predicted to be linear epitopes. The same results also appeared in the

164

HCoV-229E S trimer: fewer positive residues were located in the RBD than in the

165

SARS-CoV or SARS-CoV-2 RBM subdomain (Fig. 2A, 2C and 2E). To better

166

understand this result from a structural perspective, we analyzed the binding area of

167

the RBD and receptors from SARS-CoV, SARS-CoV-2 and HCoV-229E (Fig. 2B, 2D

168

and 2F). Among them, the interaction areas of SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 were

169

similar (approximately 829.7Å2 and 843.5Å2, respectively), which were much larger

170

than that of HCoV-229E (approximately 497Å2). Furthermore, surface area analysis

171

also yielded consistent results. Compared with HCoV-229E, the larger surface areas

172

and binding areas of the SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 RBDs to the receptor may

173

induce more nAbs. Furthermore, the RBD of SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 is in a

174

standing state, the RBD in S-trimer can also induce higher levels of neutralizing

175

antibodies than 229E.

176

Distinct immunogenicity of the RBDs in Alpha-CoV (HCoV-229E) and Beta-CoV

177

(SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2)

178

To evaluate the immunogenicity of the S trimers and RBDs between Alpha-CoV

179

(HCoV-229E) and Beta-CoV (SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2), the S trimer and RBD

180

were used as antigens to immunize mice. The antibody response was measured by

181

ELISA using collected sera. The data showed that the S trimers and RBDs of

182

SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 could induce high levels of protein-specific antibodies

183

(antibody titers: 1.36×105, 3.84×105; 1.625×106, 5×105, respectively, Fig. 3A-3D).

184

Moreover, the S trimers of both SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 could induce high-titer

185

RBD antibodies (antibody titers: 1.28×105; 2.75×105, respectively), and the

186

RBD-specific antibodies had a high affinity for the S trimer (antibody titers: 6.72×105;

187

5×105, respectively, Fig. 3A-3D). Similar to SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2, the S

188

trimer and RBD of HCoV-229E both had good immunogenicity (antibody titers:

189

8.8×104; 7.68×105, respectively, Fig. 3E and 3F). However, the HCoV-229E S trimer

190

induced fewer RBD-specific antibodies than those of SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2

191

(antibody titer: <500, Fig. 3F), and the HCoV-229E RBD-specific antibodies had a

192

lower affinity for the S trimer (antibody titer: 1.125×103, Fig. 3E). To confirm this

193

finding, a higher immunization dose of the HCoV-229E RBD (50 µg) was used in the

194

same manner. Nevertheless, no significant increase in the RBD-specific antibody titer

195

(antibody titers: 1.792×106, 3.072×106, Fig. 3G) or antibody affinity for the

196

HCoV-229E S trimer (antibody titers: 2.5×102, 2.5×102, Fig. 3H) was noted. Overall,

197

our immune epitope analysis and biochemical tests consistently showed that the S

198

trimer with a “standing” RBD state that is more conducive to inducing RBD-specific

199

antibodies in SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2. The “lying” RBD state induces fewer

200

RBD-specific antibodies and resulted in a lower affinity between the S trimer and the

201

RBD-specific antibodies in HCoV-229E.

202

Alpha-CoV (HCoV-229E) induced fewer RBD-specific neutralizing antibodies

203

Next, we tested the neutralizing ability of the sera using a vesicular stomatitis

204

virus (VSV)-based pseudovirus. Both the S trimer and RBD sera from SARS-CoV-

205

and SARS-CoV-2-immunized mice had a good neutralizing ability (Fig. 3I and 3J).

206

For HCoV-229E, the S trimer serum had a comparable neutralizing ability to that of

207

SARS-CoV or SARS-CoV-2, but the RBD serum had no detectable neutralizing

208

ability (Fig. 3K). Our experimental results indicate that the lying state of the RBD in

209

the HCoV-229E S-trimer induces the production of very few antibodies targeting the

210

RBD, but the S-trimer still produces strong neutralizing antibody levels.

211

In this study, we found that more RBD-specific antibodies were induced by the

212

S trimer with the RBD in the standing state than the S trimer with the RBD in the

213

lying state, and the affinity between RBD-specific antibodies and the S trimer was

214

also higher in the standing state. However, we also found that fewer nAbs were

215

induced by the RBD of HCoV-229E than by the RBDs of SARS-CoV or

216

SARS-CoV-2. In terms of HCoV-229E, the distribution of the potential residues in the

217

RBM was lower than that of SARS-CoV or SARS-CoV-2, which may have been

218

caused by different RBM patterns and exposure degrees. When we compared the

219

reported nAb epitopes of SARS-CoV and Alpha-CoV TGEV with our results (47),

220

they were basically consistent. Therefore, we believe that this finding illustrates the

221

inherent difference between the RBDs of alpha- and beta-CoV.

222

The intact and stable S1 subunit of HCoV-229E is a prerequisite for the

223

production of effective nAbs

224

Our experimental results showed that HCoV-229E S-trimer can induce strong

225

nAb levels, while the RBD alone is less immunogenic. Next, we will explore which

226

functional domains of the S-trimer are involved in the generation of nAbs. To clarify

227

this issue, we immunized mice with the HCoV-229E S trimer (10 µg), S1 (10 µg),

228

NTD (10 µg), RBD (10 µg) and NTD+RBD (5 µg+ 5 µg). Meanwhile, to better

229

confirm our results, the HCoV-229E strain VR740 was used for the neutralizing assay.

230

The results indicated that the S trimer serum had the best neutralizing ability, followed

231

by the S1 and NTD+RBD sera, while the NTD and RBD sera alone had no detectable

232

neutralizing effects (Fig. 4A). The results indicate that the S1 region in the S-trimer

233

should be the key region for nAbs induction. To further verify the importance of the

234

complete S1 structure in the S-trimer, we designed two S trimer mutants, namely, an

235

NTD-deficient S trimer and an S65C/T472C S trimer, the S1 subunit integrity or

236

stability of which was destroyed (Fig. 4C and 4F). Mutant proteins disrupt the

237

conformational conflicts that limit RBD standing, significantly improving their ability

238

to bind hAPN (Fig. 4D and 4G). However, an incomplete or unstable S1

239

conformation significantly reduces the level of nAbs induced by the S-trimer (Fig. 4E

240

and 4K). Taken together, these results showed that the intact and stable S1 subunit of

241

HCoV-229E is a prerequisite for the production of effective nAbs.

242

Furthermore, our experimental results show that RBD has a higher ability to bind
11

243

to the receptor hAPN (Fig. 4B), which indicates that the characteristics of RBD itself

244

may lead to the generation of less neutralizing antibodies. Furthermore, we screened

245

monoclonal antibodies using S-trimer, and the results showed that few antibodies

246

targeting S1-RBD (Fig. 5A). To further determine the ability of RBD to induce

247

antibodies itself, we screened monoclonal antibodies targeting the S1 region and

248

found that the proportion of antibodies targeting RBD was approximately 20% (Fig.

249

5B). Since the S1 protein is expressed in a monomeric form, RBD is not restricted by

250

the conformation of the surrounding domains and should be in a standing state.

251

Therefore, our results indicate that HCoV-229E RBD may induce weaker levels of

252

neutralizing antibodies, which may be related to its own characteristics. Furthermore,

253

the RBD in the HCoV-229E S-trimer is in the lying state. Its characteristics and

254

conformational state may prompt the HCoV-229E to escape the host's immune

255

surveillance, thereby allowing itself to circulate in the population for a long time.

We compared the structures of S trimers and RBDs among alpha-coronaviruses

259

(Figs. 1B and 6A). We also predicted the potential B-cell epitopes for their RBDs

260

(Fig. 6A; Table1). In Alpha-CoV, the S-trimer had a closed S1 subunit with three

261

“lying” RBDs (Fig. 1B). Moreover, the RBDs consist of a standard β-sandwich fold

262

core and three short discontinuous loops in the same spatial region (12, 14, 16, 21, 26,

263

27, 48) (Fig. 6A). Meanwhile, we performed a structural conservative analysis and the

264

results showed that the RBD structures of HCoV-NL63, PEDV, and FIPV are most

265

similar to HCoV-229E, with RSMD values of 1.9, 2.0, and 2.2, respectively (Fig. 6B).

266

In addition, the distribution of potential B-cell epitopes in the RBDs of alpha-CoVs

267

was also similar to that of HCoV-229E (Fig. 6A and 6C; Table1). Based on the above

268

data, inherent differences exist in the RBDs between alpha- and beta-CoVs (Figs. 2

269

and 6A). However, the alpha- and beta-CoVs show high similarity in their RBDs and

270

similar potential immune characteristics within their respective genera (Figs. 2, 3, 6A

271

and 6B). Accordingly, in alpha-CoVs such as HCoV-229E, subunit vaccines should

272

prioritize the S-trimer rather than the RBD. In beta-CoVs such as SARS-CoV and

273

SARS-CoV-2, the S trimer and RBD are both good candidates for subunit vaccines

274

(Fig. 7).

275

In summary, we systematically analyzed the conformational states and

276

immunogenicity of the S-trimers and RBDs of Alpha-CoV (HCoV-229E) and

277

Beta-CoV (SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2). Our results showed that the inherent

278

differences between the RBDs of alpha- and Beta-CoVs and revealed potential

279

identical immune characteristics in alpha- and Beta-CoVs. Based on these findings,

280

we provide potential vaccine strategies for alpha- and Beta-CoVs: for alpha-CoVs, the

281

S trimer or S1 subunit is more suitable for subunit vaccines than the RBD, but the

282

ADE effect of the alpha-CoVs S trimer still requires further investigation. For

283

Beta-CoVs, SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2, the S trimer and RBD are both candidates

284

for subunit vaccines. However, considering the ADE effect reported in SARS-CoV

285

and the homology between the SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 S proteins, the RBD

286

may be a priority in the design of subunit vaccines. Although our inference requires

291

According to previous research, insect codon-optimized sequences encoding the

292

HCoV-229E S glycoprotein ectodomain (GenBank accession number NP_073551.1,

293

residues 1-1,116) and SARS-CoV S glycoprotein ectodomain with an R667A

294

mutation (GenBank accession number NP_828851.1, residues 1-1,195) were cloned

295

into the baculovirus transfer vector pFastbac1 (Invitrogen) with a gene fragment

296

encoding

297

(LIKRMKQIEDKIEEIESKQKKIENEIARIKKIK) and an eight-residue Strep-tag

298

(WSHPQFEK) (20, 22). Additionally, human aminopeptidase N (hAPN) (GenBank

299

accession number JX869059, residues D66-K967) (49) was cloned into the

300

pFast-bac1 vector with an N-terminal honeybee melittin signal peptide and a

301

C-terminal 6x His-tag. HCoV-229E S1 (M1-A536), S1-NTD (M1-V258) and S1-RBD

302

(295V-428V) containing an N-terminal honeybee melittin signal peptide and a

303

C-terminal Fc-tag were constructed using the same method (29). Besides, the S

Protein expression and purification

311

The spike protein ectodomain (including a variety of truncated proteins and

312

mutant proteins) and hAPN were expressed and purified using a previously described

313

protocol (20, 29). Briefly, the construct was transformed into bacterial DH10Bac

314

competent cells (Invitrogen); then, the extracted bacmid was transfected into Sf9 cells

315

(American Type Culture Collection). The supernatant of the cell culture containing the

316

secreted S glycoprotein was harvested at 60 h after infection and concentrated, and the

317

buffer was changed to binding buffer (10 mM HEPES pH 7.2 and 500 mM NaCl).

318

Finally, the S glycoprotein was captured by StrepTactin Sepharose High Performance

319

resin (GE Healthcare) and eluted with 10 mM D-desthiobiotin in the binding buffer

320

(20). For SARS-CoV-2, the S-trimer ectodomain and RBD were purchased from Sino

321

Biological, Inc. Finally, the protein storage buffer is exchanged for 10 mM HEPES

322

pH 7.2 and 150 mM NaCl for subsequent assays.

323

Animal immunization

324

Female BALB/c mice aged 6 weeks were immunized with different proteins at 0

325

and 3 weeks. Proteins (10 µg) diluted in HEPES-buffered saline (HBS; 10 mM

326

HEPES and 150 mM NaCl) were mixed 1:1 with the 2× Sigma Adjuvant System. The

327

mice were intramuscularly inoculated with 50 μl of this solution (25 μl into each hind

328

leg). Two weeks after the final immunization, sera were collected for subsequent

329

assays. For SARS-CoV-2, the corresponding rabbit polyclonal antibodies (pAbs) were

330

purchased from Sino Biological, Inc.

331

Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA)

332

To measure the immune responses of different sera, ELISA plates were coated

333

with purified protein at 0.1 µM/well in citrate-buffered saline (CBS, pH=9.6)

334

overnight at 4°C and subsequently blocked with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) with

335

0.05% Tween 20 (PBST) containing 1% bovine serum albumin (BSA, w/v) at 37°C.

336

After standard washes, the plates were incubated with 2- or 10-fold serially diluted

337

sera for 1 h at 37°C. Then, horseradish peroxidase (HRP)-conjugated goat

338

anti-mouse/rabbit IgG (1:10,000 diluted in PBST with 1% BSA (w/v), Boster) was

339

used as the secondary antibody, and 3,3',5,5'-tetramethylbenzidine (TMB) (Beyotime)

340

was used as the substrate for detection. Optical density (OD) was read at 450 nm and

341

630 nm using a SPARK10M microplate reader (TECAN) after stopping the reaction

342

with 2 M H2SO4. Sera from mice immunized with HBS were used as a mock control.

343

For the receptor-binding assay, the ELISA plates were coated with hAPN at 0.1

344

μM/well in CBS (pH=9.6) overnight at 4°C and subsequently blocked with PBST

345

containing 1% BSA (w/v) at 37°C. After washing, the HCoV-229E S-trimer, NTD,

346

RBD and mutant proteins were serially diluted 2-fold in HBS and incubated with the

347

plates for 1h at room temperature. Then, the mouse anti-Strep-tag II antibody (SAB,

348

1:3,000 diluted in PBST with 1% BSA (w/v)) and HRP-conjugated goat anti-mouse

349

IgG (1:5,000 diluted in PBST with 1% BSA (w/v), Boster) was used for detection.

350

Signal reading was carried out in the same manner. HBS buffer was used as a mock

351

control.

353

Six-week-old female BALB/c mice were immunized with 100 µg of purified

354

HCoV-229E S-trimer or S1 protein. Antigens were emulsified in Freund’s Complete

355

Adjuvant (Sigma-Aldrich, F5881) for the first immunization or Freund’s Incomplete

356

Adjuvant (Sigma-Aldrich, F5506) for the subsequent boost. Each mouse received

357

three subcutaneous injections at two-weeks intervals. Mice with the highest titers of

358

antibodies against the HCoV-229E S-trimer or S1 protein were further boosted by

359

intraperitoneal injection 200 µg of purified HCoV-229E S-trimer or S1 protein diluted

360

in PBS buffer. Three days after the last injection, spleen cells were collected and fused

361

with SP2/0 cells with PEG1450 (Sigma-Aldrich, P7181) to generate hybridoma cells.

362

Antigen-specific ELISA was used for the hybridoma screening. Positive hybridomas

363

were further subcloned and used for epitope mapping. To this end, ELISA plates were

364

coated with different proteins (the HCoV-229E S-trimer, S1, NTD and RBD) at

365

1μg/ml in CBS (pH=9.6) overnight at 4°C and subsequently blocked and washed.

366

Then the plates were reacted with the hybridoma culture supernatants at 37℃ for 1h.

367

HRP-conjugated goat anti-mouse IgG (1:5,000 diluted in PBST with 1% BSA (w/v),

368

Boster) was used for detection. Signal reading was carried out in the manner

369

described above. Hybridoma culturing medium was used as a mock control.

neutralization experiments, 2-fold serial dilutions of mouse sera (initially 1:8) were

401

mixed with an equal volume of H229E virus (100 TCID50 /well) at 37°C. The

402

neutralization titers were measured by the observed CPE. Serum from a PBS-treated

B-cell epitope prediction analysis

405

According to previous research, B-cell epitope were predicted and analyzed

406

(IEDB, http://www.iedb.org) (51). Briefly, structure-based B-cell epitope prediction

407

was performed by DiscoTope 2.0 with a positive cutoff greater than -3.7

408

(corresponding to a specificity greater than or equal to 0.75 and a sensitivity less than

409

0.47) using the following protein structures: the HCoV-229E S-trimer and RBD (PDB

410

IDs: 6U7H and 6ATK, respectively), the SARS-CoV S-trimer and RBD (PDB IDs:

411

5X5B and 2AJF, respectively), the SARS-CoV-2 S-trimer and RBD (PDB IDs: 6VYB

412

and 6M0J, respectively), the PEDV RBD (PDB ID: 6U7K), the FIPV RBD (PDB ID:

413

6JX7), the PRCoV RBD (PDB ID: 4F5C), and the transmissible gastroenteritis virus

414

(TGEV) RBD (PDB ID: 4F2M). For linear B-cell epitope prediction, the

415

corresponding amino acid sequences from the above structures were used. The

416

BepiPred 2.0 algorithm was applied with a cutoff of 0.55 (corresponding to a

417

specificity greater than 0.81 and a sensitivity less than 0.3). All the predicted residues

were then labeled in corresponding structures using PyMOL (Schrödinger). The
