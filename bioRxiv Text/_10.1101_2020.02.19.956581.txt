SUMMARY
The recent emergence of a novel coronavirus associated with an ongoing outbreak of
pneumonia (Covid-2019) resulted in infections of more than 72,000 people and claimed
over 1,800 lives. Coronavirus spike (S) glycoprotein trimers promote entry into cells and
are the main target of the humoral immune response. We show here that SARS-CoV-2
S mediates entry in VeroE6 cells and in BHK cells transiently transfected with human
ACE2, establishing ACE2 as a functional receptor for this novel coronavirus. We further
demonstrate that the receptor-binding domains of SARS-CoV-2 S and SARS-CoV S
bind with similar affinities to human ACE2, which correlates with the efficient spread of
SARS-CoV-2 among humans. We found that the SARS-CoV-2 S glycoprotein harbors a
furin cleavage site at the boundary between the S1/S2 subunits, which is processed
during biogenesis and sets this virus apart from SARS-CoV and other SARS-related
CoVs. We determined a cryo-electron microscopy structure of the SARS-CoV-2 S
ectodomain trimer, demonstrating spontaneous opening of the receptor-binding domain,
and providing a blueprint for the design of vaccines and inhibitors of viral entry. Finally,
we demonstrate that SARS-CoV S murine polyclonal sera potently inhibited SARS-CoV-

INTRODUCTION
Three coronaviruses have crossed the species barrier to cause deadly
pneumonia in humans since the beginning of the 21st century: severe acute respiratory
syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) (Drosten et al., 2003; Ksiazek et al., 2003), MiddleEast respiratory syndrome coronavirus (Zaki et al., 2012) (MERS-CoV) and SARS-CoV2 (Huang et al., 2020; Zhu et al., 2020). SARS-CoV emerged in the Guangdong
province of China in 2002 and spread to five continents through air travel routes,
infecting 8,098 people and causing 774 deaths. In 2012, MERS-CoV emerged in the
Arabian Peninsula, where it remains a major public health concern, and was exported to
27 countries, infecting a total of ~2,494 individuals and claiming 858 lives. A previously
unknown coronavirus, named SARS-CoV-2, was discovered in December 2019 in
Wuhan, Hubei Province of China and was sequenced and isolated by January 2020
(Zhou et al., 2020; Zhu et al., 2020). SARS-CoV-2 is associated with an ongoing
outbreak of atypical pneumonia (Covid-2019) that has affected over 72,436 people and
killed more than 1,868 of them in 29 countries as of February 15th 2020. On January
30th 2020, the World Health Organization declared the SARS-CoV-2 epidemic as a
public health emergency of international concern.

MERS-CoV was suggested to originate from bats but the reservoir host fueling
spillover to humans is unequivocally dromedary camels (Haagmans et al., 2014;
Memish et al., 2013). Both SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 are closely related to each
other and originated in bats which most likely serve as reservoir host for these two
viruses (Ge et al., 2013; Hu et al., 2017; Li et al., 2005b; Yang et al., 2015a; Zhou et al.,

2020). Whereas palm civets and racoon dogs have been recognized as an intermediate
host for zoonotic transmission of SARS-CoV between bats and humans (Guan et al.,
2003; Kan et al., 2005; Wang et al., 2005), the intermediate host of SARS-CoV-2
remains unknown. The recurrent spillovers of coronaviruses in humans along with
detection of numerous coronaviruses

in bats, including many SARS-related

coronaviruses (SARSr-CoVs), suggest that future zoonotic transmission events may
continue to occur (Anthony et al., 2017; Ge et al., 2013; Hu et al., 2017; Li et al., 2005b;
Menachery et al., 2015; Menachery et al., 2016; Yang et al., 2015a; Zhou et al., 2020).
In addition to the highly pathogenic zoonotic pathogens SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV and
SARS-CoV-2, all belonging to the β-coronavirus genus, four low pathogenicity
coronaviruses are endemic in humans: HCoV-OC43, HCoV-HKU1, HCoV-NL63 and
HCoV-229E.To date, no therapeutics or vaccines are approved against any humaninfecting coronaviruses.

Coronavirus entry into host cells is mediated by the transmembrane spike (S)
glycoprotein that forms homotrimers protruding from the viral surface (Tortorici and
Veesler, 2019). S comprises two functional subunits responsible for binding to the host
cell receptor (S1 subunit) and fusion of the viral and cellular membranes (S2 subunit).
For many CoVs, S is cleaved at the boundary between the S1 and S2 subunits which
remain non-covalently bound in the prefusion conformation (Belouzard et al., 2009;
Bosch et al., 2003; Burkard et al., 2014; Kirchdoerfer et al., 2016; Millet and Whittaker,
2014, 2015; Park et al., 2016; Walls et al., 2016a). The distal S1 subunit comprises the
receptor-binding domain(s), and contributes to stabilization of the prefusion state of the
membrane-anchored S2 subunit that contains the fusion machinery (Gui et al., 2017;
Kirchdoerfer et al., 2016; Pallesen et al., 2017; Song et al., 2018; Walls et al., 2016a;
Walls et al., 2017b; Yuan et al., 2017). For all CoVs, S is further cleaved by host
proteases at the so-called S2’ site located immediately upstream of the fusion peptide
(Madu et al., 2009; Millet and Whittaker, 2015). This cleavage has been proposed to
activate the protein for membrane fusion via extensive irreversible conformational
changes (Belouzard et al., 2009; Heald-Sargent and Gallagher, 2012; Millet and
Whittaker, 2014, 2015; Park et al., 2016; Walls et al., 2017b). As a result, coronavirus

entry into susceptible cells is a complex process that requires the concerted action of
receptor-binding and proteolytic processing of the S protein to promote virus-cell fusion.

Different coronaviruses use distinct domains within the S1 subunit to recognize a
variety of attachment and entry receptors, depending on the viral species. Endemic
human coronaviruses OC43 and HKU1 attach via their S domain A (SA) to 5-N-acetyl-9O-acetyl-sialosides found on glycoproteins and glycolipids at the host cell surface to
enable entry into susceptible cells (Hulswit et al., 2019; Tortorici et al., 2019; Vlasak et
al., 1988). MERS-CoV S, however, uses domain A to engage non-acetylated sialosides
as attachment receptors (Li et al., 2017; Park et al., 2019) and promote subsequent
binding of domain B (SB) to the entry receptor, dipeptidyl-peptidase 4 (Lu et al., 2013;
Raj et al., 2013). SARS-CoV and several SARS-related coronaviruses (SARSr-CoV)
interact directly with angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) via SB to enter target
cells (Ge et al., 2013; Kirchdoerfer et al., 2018; Li et al., 2005a; Li et al., 2003; Song et
al., 2018; Yang et al., 2015a).

As the coronavirus S glycoprotein is surface-exposed and mediates entry into
host cells, it is the main target of neutralizing antibodies (Abs) upon infection and the
focus of therapeutic and vaccine design. S trimers are extensively decorated with Nlinked glycans that are important for proper folding (Rossen et al., 1998) and to
modulate accessibility to host proteases and neutralizing antibodies (Walls et al., 2016b;
Walls et al., 2019; Xiong et al., 2017; Yang et al., 2015b). We previously characterized
potent human neutralizing Abs from rare memory B cells of individuals infected with
SARS-CoV (Traggiai et al., 2004) or MERS-CoV (Corti et al., 2015) in complex with
SARS-CoV S and MERS-CoV S to provide molecular-level information of the
mechanism of competitive inhibition of SB attachment to the host receptor (Walls et al.,
2019). The S230 anti-SARS-CoV antibody also acted by functionally mimicking
receptor-attachment and promoting spike fusogenic conformational rearrangements
through a ratcheting mechanism that elucidated the unique nature of the coronavirus
membrane fusion activation (Walls et al., 2019).

We report here that ACE2 could mediate SARS-CoV-2 S-mediated entry into
cells, establishing it as a functional receptor for this newly emerged coronavirus. The
SARS-CoV-2 SB engages human ACE2 (hACE2) with comparable affinity than SARSCoV SB from viral isolates associated with the 2002-2003 epidemic (i.e. binding with
high affinity to hACE2). Tight binding to hACE2 could explain the efficient transmission
of SARS-CoV-2 in humans, as was the case for SARS-CoV. We identified the presence
of an unexpected furin cleavage site at the S1/S2 boundary of SARS-CoV-2 S, which is
cleaved during biosynthesis, a novel feature setting this virus apart from SARS-CoV and
SARSr-CoVs. Abrogation of this cleavage motif moderately affected SARS-CoV-2 Smediated entry into VeroE6 or BHK cells but may contribute to expand the tropism of
this virus, as reported for several highly pathogenic avian influenza viruses and
pathogenic Newcastle disease virus (Klenk and Garten, 1994; Steinhauer, 1999). We
determined a cryo-electron microscopy structure of the SARS-CoV-2 S ectodomain
trimer and reveal that it adopts multiple SB conformations that are reminiscent of
previous reports on both SARS-CoV S and MERS-CoV S. Finally, we show that SARSCoV S mouse polyclonal sera potently inhibited entry into target cells of SARS-CoV-2 S
pseudotyped viruses. Collectively, these results pave the way for designing vaccines
eliciting broad protection against SARS-CoV-2, SARS-CoV and SARSr-CoV.
RESULTS
ACE2 is an entry receptor for SARS-CoV-2
The SARS-CoV-2 S glycoprotein shares ~80% amino acid sequence identity with
the SARS-CoV S Urbani and with bat SARSr-CoV ZXC21 S and ZC45 S glycoprotein.
The latter two SARSr-CoV sequences were identified from Rinolophus sinicus (Chinese
horseshoe bats), the species from which SARSr-CoV WIV-1 and WIV-16 were isolated
(Ge et al., 2013; Yang et al., 2015a). Furthermore, Zhou et al recently reported that
SARS-CoV-2 is most closely related to the bat SARSr-CoV RaTG13 with which it forms
a distinct lineage from other SARSr-CoVs, and that their S glycoproteins share 98%
amino acid sequence identity (Zhou et al., 2020). SARS-CoV recognizes its entry
receptor human ACE2 (hACE2) at the surface of type II pneumocytes, using SB which
shares ~75% overall amino acid sequence identity with SARS-CoV-2 SB and 50%

identity within their receptor-binding motifs (RBMs) (Li et al., 2005a; Li et al., 2003; Li et
al., 2005c; Wan et al., 2020). Previous studies also showed that the host proteases
cathepsin L and TMPRSS2 prime SARS-CoV S for membrane fusion through cleavage
at the S1/S2 and at the S2’ sites (Belouzard et al., 2009; Bosch et al., 2008; Glowacka et
al., 2011; Matsuyama et al., 2010; Millet and Whittaker, 2015; Shulla et al., 2011).

We set out to investigate the functional determinants of S-mediated entry into
target cells using a murine leukemia virus (MLV) pseudotyping system (Millet and
Whittaker, 2016). To assess the ability of SARS-CoV-2 S to promote entry into target
cells, we first compared transduction of SARS-CoV-2 S-MLV and SARS-CoV S-MLV
into VeroE6 cells, that are known to express ACE2 and support SARS-CoV replication
(Drosten et al., 2003; Ksiazek et al., 2003). Both pseudoviruses entered cells equally
well (Fig. 1 A), suggesting that SARS-CoV-2 S-MLV could potentially use African green
monkey ACE2 as entry receptor. To confirm these results, we evaluated entry into BHK
cells and observed that transient transfection with hACE2 rendered them susceptible to
transduction with SARS-CoV-2 S-MLV (Fig. 1 B). These results demonstrate hACE2 is
a functional receptor for SARS-CoV-2, in agreement with recently reported findings
(Hoffmann et al., 2020; Letko and Munster, 2020; Zhou et al., 2020).

Sequence analysis of SARS-CoV-2 S reveals the presence of a four amino acid
residue insertion at the boundary between the S1 and S2 subunits compared to SARSCoV S and SARSr-CoV S (Fig. 1 C). This results in the introduction of a furin cleavage
site, a feature conserved among the 103 SARS-CoV-2 isolates sequenced to date but
not in the closely related RaTG13 S (Zhou et al., 2020). Using Western blot analysis, we
observed that SARS-CoV-2 S was virtually entirely processed at the S1/S2 site during
biosynthesis in HEK293T cells, presumably by furin in the Golgi compartment (Fig. 1
D). This observation contrasts with SARS-CoV S which was incorporated into
pseudovirions largely uncleaved (Fig. 1 D). To study the influence on pseudovirus entry
of the SARS-CoV-2 S1/S2 furin cleavage site, we designed an S mutant lacking the four

Sfur/mut). SARS-CoV-2 Sfur/mut preserves only the conserved Arg residue at position 994
of wildtype SARS-CoV-2 S thereby mimicking the S1/S2 cleavage site of the related
SARSr-CoV S CZX21 (Fig. 1 D). SARS-CoV-2 Sfur/mut is therefore expected to undergo
processing at the S1/S2 site upon encounter of a target cell, similarly to SARS-CoV S
and SARSr-CoV S (i.e. via TMPRSS2 and/or cathepsin L). As expected, SARS-CoV-2
Sfur/mut-MLV harbored uncleaved S upon budding (Fig. 1 D). The observed transduction
efficiency of VeroE6 cells was higher for SARS-CoV-2 Sfur/mut-MLV than for SARS-CoV2 S-MLV Fig. 1 A) whereas the opposite trend was observed for transduction of hACE2expressing BHK cells (Fig. 1 B). These results suggest that S1/S2 cleavage during S
biosynthesis was not necessary for S-mediated entry in the conditions of our
experiments (Fig. 1 C-D). We speculate that the detection of a polybasic cleavage site
in the fusion glycoprotein of SARS-CoV-2 could putatively expand its tropism and/or
enhance its transmissibility, compared to SARS-CoV and SARSr-CoV isolates, due to
the near-ubiquitous distribution of furin-like proteases and their reported effects on other
viruses (Klenk and Garten, 1994; Millet and Whittaker, 2015; Steinhauer, 1999) .

SARS-CoV-2 recognizes human ACE2 with comparable affinity than SARS-CoV
The binding affinity of SARS-CoV for hACE2 correlate with the overall rate of
viral replication in distinct species, transmissibility and disease severity (Guan et al.,
2003; Li et al., 2004; Li et al., 2005c; Wan et al., 2020). Indeed, specific SB mutations
enabled efficient binding to hACE2 of SARS-CoV isolates from the three phases of the
2002-2003 epidemic, which were associated with marked disease severity (Consortium,
2004; Kan et al., 2005; Li et al., 2005c; Sui et al., 2004). In contrast, SARS-CoV isolates
detected during the brief 2003-2004 re-emergence interacted more weakly with hACE2,
but tightly with civet ACE2, and had low pathogenicity and transmissibility (Consortium,
2004; Kan et al., 2005; Li et al., 2005c).

To understand the contribution of receptor interaction to the infectivity of SARSCoV-2, we characterized engagement of hACE2 by SARS-CoV-2 SB and SARS-CoV SB
side-by-side. We used biolayer interferometry to study binding kinetics and affinity of the
purified hACE2 ectodomain to SARS-CoV-2 SB and SARS-CoV SB immobilized at the
surface of biosensors. We found that hACE2 bound to SARS-CoV-2 SB and SARS-CoV
SB with respective equilibrium dissociation constants of 2.9 nM (Fig. 2 A) and 7.7 nM
(Fig. 2 B), and comparable kinetic rate constants although the off-rate was slightly

higher for SARS-CoV SB (Table 1). Previous structural work identified 14 positions that
are key for binding of SARS-CoV SB to hACE2: T402, R426, Y436, Y440, Y442, L472,
N473, Y475, N479, Y484, T486, T487, G488 and Y491 (Li et al., 2005a). Analysis of
the 104 SARS-CoV-2 genome sequences available from GISAID (Elbe and BucklandMerrett, 2017) shows that 8 out of these 14 positions are strictly conserved in SARSCoV-2 SB whereas the other 6 positions are (semi)-conservatively substituted:
R426SARS-CoVN448SARS-CoV-2,

Y442SARS-CoVL464SARS-CoV-2,

L472SARS-CoVF495SARS-CoV-2,

N479SARS-CoVQ502SARS-CoV-2,

Y484SARS-CoVQ507SARS-CoV-2,

T487SARS-CoVN510SARS-CoV-2

(Fig. 2 C). The conservation of many key contact residues could explain the similar
binding affinities of SARS-CoV-2 SB and SARS-CoV SB for hACE2. No mutations of
residues predicted to contact hACE2 have been observed among SARS-CoV-2 S
sequences available to date. However, we note that SARSr-CoV ZXC21 and ZC45,
which harbor the most closely related S sequences after SARSr-CoV RaTG13,
comprise two deletions in the RBD that could affect binding to hACE2 (between SARSCoV-2 S residues 482-489 and 494-499) (Fig. S 1). Collectively, these results suggest
that SARS-CoV-2 is at least as well adapted to the hACE2 orthologue as the 2002-2003
epidemic strains of SARS-CoV, which could explain the efficient transduction efficiency
mediated by their respective S glycoproteins (Fig. 1 A-B) and the current rapid SARSCoV-2 transmission in humans.

Architecture of the SARS-CoV-2 spike glycoprotein trimer
To enable single-particle cryoEM study of the SARS-CoV-2 S glycoprotein, we
designed a prefusion stabilized ectodomain trimer construct with an abrogated furin
S1/S2 cleavage site (Tortorici et al., 2019; Walls et al., 2017a; Walls et al., 2016a; Walls
et al., 2019), two consecutive proline stabilizing mutations (Kirchdoerfer et al., 2018;
Pallesen et al., 2017) and a C-terminal foldon trimerization domain (Miroshnikov et al.,
1998). 3D classification of the cryoEM data revealed the presence of multiple
conformational states of SARS-CoV-2 S corresponding to distinct organization of the SB
domains within the S1 apex. Approximately half of the particle images selected
correspond to trimers harboring a single SB domain opened whereas the remaining half
was accounted for by closed trimers with the 3 SB domains closed. The observed
conformational variability of SB domains is reminiscent of observations made with
SARS-CoV S and MERS-CoV S trimers although we did not detect trimers with two SB
domains open and the distribution of particles across the S conformational landscape
varies among studies (Gui et al., 2017; Kirchdoerfer et al., 2018; Pallesen et al., 2017;
Song et al., 2018; Walls et al., 2019; Yuan et al., 2017).

We determined a reconstruction of the closed SARS-CoV-2 S ectodomain trimer
at 3.3 Å resolution (applying 3-fold symmetry) and an asymmetric reconstruction of the
trimer with a single SB domain opened at 3.7 Å resolution (Fig 3 A-H, Fig S2, Table 2).
The S2 fusion machinery is the best resolved part of the map whereas the SA and SB
domains are less well resolved, presumably due to conformational heterogeneity. The
final atomic model comprises residues 36-1157, with internal breaks corresponding to
flexible regions, and lacks the C-terminal most segment (including the heptad repeat 2)
which is not visible in the map, as is the case for all S structures determined to date.

Overall, the SARS-CoV-2 S ectodomain is a 160Å-long trimer with a triangular crosssection, resembling the closely related SARS-CoV S structure (Fig S3 A-F) (Gui et al.,
2017; Kirchdoerfer et al., 2018; Song et al., 2018; Walls et al., 2019; Yuan et al., 2017).
As is the case for other β-coronavirus S glycoproteins, including SARS-CoV S
(Gui et al., 2017; Kirchdoerfer et al., 2018; Pallesen et al., 2017; Park et al., 2019; Song
et al., 2018; Tortorici et al., 2019; Walls et al., 2016a; Walls et al., 2016b; Walls et al.,
2019; Yuan et al., 2017), the S1 subunit has a V-shaped architecture (Fig S3 B-E). In
the closed S trimer, the three hACE2-recognition motifs, whose location was inferred
based on the crystal structure of SARS-CoV SB in complex with hACE2 (Li et al.,
2005a), are buried at the interface between protomers. As a result, SARS-CoV-2 SB
opening is expected to be necessary for interacting with ACE2 at the host cell surface
and initiating the conformational changes leading to cleavage of the S2’ site, membrane
fusion and viral entry (Gui et al., 2017; Kirchdoerfer et al., 2018; Millet and Whittaker,
2014; Pallesen et al., 2017; Park et al., 2016; Song et al., 2018; Walls et al., 2019; Yuan
et al., 2017).

As the SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV S2 subunits share 88% sequence identity,
they are structurally conserved and can be superimposed with 1.2 Å rmsd over 417
aligned Cα positions (Fig S3 E-F). Only the most N-terminal part of the fusion peptide is
resolved in the map, as was the case for previously determined SARS-CoV S
structures. The sequence and conformational conservation of the fusion peptide region
observed across SARS-CoV-2 S and SARS-CoV S suggests that antibodies targeting
this functionally important motif might cross-react and neutralize the two viruses as well
as related coronaviruses (Fig S3 G-H)

We previously showed that coronavirus S glycoproteins are densely decorated
by heterogeneous N-linked glycans protruding from the trimer surface (Walls et al.,
2016b; Walls et al., 2019; Xiong et al., 2017). These oligosaccharides participate in S
folding (Rossen et al., 1998), they affect priming by host proteases (Yang et al., 2015b)
and modulate antibody recognition (Pallesen et al., 2017; Walls et al., 2019). SARS-

CoV-2 S comprise 22 N-linked glycosylation sequons per protomer and 16 of them are
resolved in the cryoEM map (Fig. 4). By comparison, SARS-CoV S possesses 23 Nlinked glycosylation sequons per protomer and we previously confirmed experimentally
that at least 19 of them are glycosylated (Walls et al., 2019). 20 out of 22 SARS-CoV-2
S N-linked glycosylation sequons are conserved in SARS-CoV S (Table 3). Specifically,
9 out of 13 glycans in the S1 subunit and all 9 glycans in the S2 subunit are conserved
among SARS-CoV-2 S and SARS-CoV S. Furthermore, S2 oligosaccharides are mostly
conserved across SARSr-CoV S glycoproteins, suggesting that accessibility of the
fusion machinery to antibodies will be comparable among these viruses.

SARS-CoV S elicits neutralizing antibodies against SARS-CoV-2 S
Mapping of the sequence conservation across multiple sarbecovirus S
sequences underscores that the S2 fusion machinery is more conserved than the S1

observations are in line with (i) the fact that some, but not all of these viruses use ACE2
as entry receptor (Ge et al., 2013; Ren et al., 2008; Yang et al., 2015a); and (ii) that the
S1 subunit is more exposed at the viral surface than the fusion machinery, and is likely
to be subject to a more stringent selection pressure from the immune system.

Based on these observations, we hypothesized that exposure to one of the two
viruses could elicit cross-reactive and potentially neutralizing antibodies against the
other virus. We therefore investigated the ability of plasma from four mice immunized
with a stabilized SARS-CoV S to inhibit SARS-CoV-2 S- and SARS-CoV S-mediated
entry into target cells. All sera tested completely inhibited transduction of SARS-CoV SMLV and reduced SARS-CoV-2 S-MLV transduction to ~10% of control in VeroE6 cells
(Fig. 5C). The elicitation of a heterotypic response blocking SARS-CoV-2 S-mediated
entry into host cells concurs with the sequence and structural conservation of SARSCoV-2 S and SARS-CoV S along with their comparable glycans shields, and suggests
that immunity against one virus of the sarbecovirus subgenus can potentially provide
protection against related viruses.

DISCUSSION
Receptor recognition is the first step of viral infection and is a key determinant of
host cell and tissue tropism. Enhanced binding affinity between SARS-CoV S and
hACE2 was proposed to correlate with increased virus transmissibility and disease

severity in humans (Li et al., 2005c). Indeed, SARS-CoV isolates from the three phases
of the 2002-2003 epidemic were more efficiently transmitted among humans and more
pathogenic than the isolates associated with the 2003-2004 re-emergence that caused
only a few cases, in line with their binding affinities for hACE2 (Consortium, 2004; Kan
et al., 2005; Li et al., 2005c). Moreover, the ability to engage ACE2 from different animal
species appears to reflect host susceptibility to SARS-CoV infection and facilitated the
jump of the virus from animals to humans (Li, 2008; Li et al., 2004). We report here that
SARS-CoV-2 uses hACE2 as entry receptor to which it binds with similar affinity than
the 2002-2003 SARS-CoV isolates which suggests it can spread efficiently in humans,
in agreement with the numerous SARS-CoV-2 human-to-human transmission events
reported to date.

Besides binding to host cell receptors, priming of the S glycoprotein by host
proteases through cleavage at the S1/S2 and the S2’ sites is another crucial factor
modulating tropism and pathogenicity (Millet and Whittaker, 2015). For instance, entry
of the MERS-CoV-related bat coronavirus HKU4 into human cells required addition of
exogenous trypsin, indicating that S proteolytic activation of this bat virus did not occur
in human cells (despite its ability to recognize human DPP4)(Wang et al., 2014; Yang et
al., 2014). Subsequent work suggested that a glycan present near the S1/S2 boundary
accounted for the lack of proteolytic priming of HKU4 S and that its removal enhanced
pseudovirus entry in human cells (Yang et al., 2015b). The presence of a polybasic
cleavage site, that can be processed by furin-like proteases, is a signature of several
highly pathogenic avian influenza viruses and pathogenic Newcastle disease virus
(Klenk and Garten, 1994; Steinhauer, 1999). Strikingly, SARS-CoV-2 S harbors a furin
cleavage site at the S1/S2 boundary, which is processed during biosynthesis. The
presence of a furin cleavage site sets SARS-CoV-2 S apart from SARS-CoV S (and
SARSr-CoV S) that possesses a monobasic S1/S2 cleavage site processed upon entry
of target cells (Belouzard et al., 2009; Bosch et al., 2008; Glowacka et al., 2011;
Matsuyama et al., 2010; Millet and Whittaker, 2015; Shulla et al., 2011). We speculate
that the almost ubiquitous expression of furin-like proteases could participate in

expanding SARS-CoV-2 cell and tissue tropism, relative to SARS-CoV, as well as
increase its transmissibility and/or alter its pathogenicity.

We previously suggested coronaviruses use conformational masking and glycan
shielding to limit recognition by the immune response of infected hosts (Walls et al.,
2016b; Walls et al., 2019; Xiong et al., 2017). Similarly to SARS-CoV S and MERS-CoV
S (Gui et al., 2017; Kirchdoerfer et al., 2018; Pallesen et al., 2017; Song et al., 2018;
Walls et al., 2019; Yuan et al., 2017), we found that the SARS-CoV-2 S trimer exist in
multiple, distinct conformational states resulting from SB opening at the trimer apex.
These structural changes are necessary for receptor engagement of these three viruses
and lead to initiation of fusogenic conformational changes (Song et al., 2018; Walls et
al., 2017b; Walls et al., 2019). In contrast, only closed S trimers have been detected for
HCoV-NL63 (Walls et al., 2016b), HCoV-OC43 (Tortorici et al., 2019), HCoV-HKU1
(Kirchdoerfer et al., 2016) and HCoV-229E (Li et al., 2019). As HCoV-NL63 and HCoV229E are known to engage protein receptors through SB (Wong et al., 2017; Wu et al.,
2009), trimer opening is also expected to occur to expose their receptor-recognition
motifs that are otherwise buried at the interface between protomers in the closed S
trimer (Li et al., 2019; Walls et al., 2016b). Regardless of the nature of the receptor and
of the location of the receptor-binding domains, removal of the trimeric S1 crown is
expected to be necessary for all coronaviruses to allow the large-scale S2
conformational changes leading to fusion of the viral and host membranes (Walls et al.,
2017b). Collectively, these data underscores that S glycoprotein trimers found in highly
pathogenic human coronaviruses appear to exist in partially opened states whereas
they remain largely closed in human coronaviruses associated with common colds.
Based on the aforementioned data correlating the binding affinity of SARS-CoV for
hACE2 with the rate of transmissibility, viral replication in distinct species and disease
severity (Guan et al., 2003; Li et al., 2004; Li et al., 2005c; Wan et al., 2020), we
hypothesize that the most pathogenic coronaviruses will exhibit S glycoprotein trimers
spontaneously sampling closed and open conformations, as is the case for SARS-CoV2, SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV.

The striking structural similarity and sequence conservation among the SARSCoV-2 S and SARS-CoV S glycoproteins emphasize the close relationship between
these two viruses that recognize hACE2 to enter target cells. This resemblance is
further strengthened by our finding that SARS-CoV S elicited polyclonal Ab responses
potently neutralizing SARS-CoV-2 S-mediated entry into cells. We surmise most of
these Abs target the highly conserved S2 subunit (including the fusion peptide region)
based on its structural similarity across SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV and previous
reports showing that sera from SARS-CoV-infected individuals target this region (Zhang
et al., 2004). We note that most SARS-CoV neutralizing Abs isolated to date target the
SB domain and several of them recognize the RBM and prevent receptor engagement
(Hwang et al., 2006; Rockx et al., 2008; Rockx et al., 2010; Traggiai et al., 2004; Walls
et al., 2019). As the SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV SB domains share 75% amino acid
sequence identity, future work will be necessary to evaluate how many of these
antibodies neutralize the newly emerged coronavirus. These findings also indicate that
it might be difficult to distinguish exposure to SARS-CoV-2 from other SARSr-CoVs in
serological studies using S ectodomain trimers and that specific assays will need to be
designed. Our results provide a structural framework to identify conserved and
accessible epitopes across S glycoproteins that will support ongoing vaccine design
efforts. Finally, elicitation of diverse, polyclonal Ab responses might prove key in light of
the diversity of viruses circulating in animal reservoirs and to prevent the possible
emergence of viral neutralization escape mutants.

Both constructs were produced in 500mL HEK293F cells

grown in suspension using FreeStyle 293 expression medium (Life technologies) at
37˚C in a humidified 8% CO2 incubator rotating at 130 rpm. The cultures were
transfected using 293-Free transfection reagent (Millipore) with cells grown to a density
of 1 million cells per mL and cultivated for 3 days. The supernatants were harvested and
cells resuspended for another 3 days, yielding two harvests. Proteins were purified from
clarified supernatants using a 5mL Cobalt affinity column (Takara), concentrated and
flash frozen in a buffer containing 20 mM Tris pH 8.0 and 300 mM NaCl prior to
analysis. SDS-PAGE was run to check purity.
Transient expression of hACE2
Expression and purification of human angiotensin-converting enzyme ectodomain
(ACE2, residues 1–614) fused to the Fc region of human IgG (hFc) was performed as
previously described (Walls et al., 2019) and cleavage of the Fc fragment was carried
out with thrombin. Briefly, hACE2 was produced in 500mL HEK293F cells grown in
suspension using FreeStyle 293 expression medium (Life technologies) at 37˚C in a
humidified 8% CO2 incubator rotating at 130 rpm. The cultures were transfected using
293-Free transfection reagent (Millipore) with cells grown to a density of 1 million cells
per mL and cultivated for 4 days. The supernatants were harvested and cells
resuspended for another four days, yielding two harvests. Clarified supernatants were
concentrated using Vivaflow tangential filtration cassettes (Sartorius, 10-kDa cut-off)
before affinity purification using a Protein A column (GE LifeSciences) followed by gel

filtration chromatography using a Superdex 200 10/300 GL column (GE Life Sciences)
equilibrated in 20 mM Tris-HCl, pH 8, 100 mM NaCl. The Fc tag was removed by
thrombin cleavage in a reaction mixture containing 3 mg of recombinant ACE2-FC
ectodomain and 10 μg of thrombin in 10 mMTris-HCl pH8.0 and 20mM CaCl2.The
reaction mixture was incubated at 25 °C overnight and re-loaded in a Protein A column
to remove uncleaved protein and the Fc tag. The cleaved protein was further purified by
gel filtration using a Superdex 200 column 10/300 GL (GE Life Sciences) equilibrated in
a buffer containing 20 mM Tris pH 8.0 and 100 mM NaCl. The purified protein was
quantified using absorption at 280 nm and concentrated to approximately 1 mg/ml.
Pseudovirus production
MLV-based SARS-CoV S, SARS-CoV-2 S, and SARS-CoV-2 Sfur/mut pseudotypes were
prepared as previously described (Millet and Whittaker, 2016). HEK293T cells were cotransfected using Lipofectamine 2000 (Life Technologies) with an S encoding-plasmid,
an MLV Gag-Pol packaging construct and the MLV transfer vector encoding a luciferase
reporter, according to the manufacturer’s instructions. Cells were incubated for 5 hours
at 37˚C with transfection medium. Cells were then washed with DMEM 2X and DMEM
containing 10% FBS was added for 60 hours. The supernatants were then harvested
and filtered through 0.45-mm membranes and concentrated with a 30kDa membrane for
10 minutes at 3,000 rpm and then frozen at -80˚C.
Western Blotting
SARS-CoV S, SARS-CoV-2 S, and SARS-CoV-2 SFur/Mut pseudovirions were thawed
and 4X SDS loading buffer was added prior to boiling for 10 min at 95˚C. Samples were
run on a 4%–20% gradient Tris-Glycine Gel (BioRad) and transferred to a PVDF
membrane. An anti-S2 SARS-CoV S monoclonal primary antibody (1:150 dilution) or an
MLV p30 monoclonal antibody (1:1,000 dilution, AbCam) and an Alexa Fluor 680conjugated goat anti-human or mouse secondary antibody (1:30,000 and 1:15,000
dilution respectively, Jackson Laboratory) were used for Western-blotting. A LI-COR
processor was used to develop images.

Pseudovirus entry assays
VeroE6 and Baby Hamster Kidney (BHK) cells were cultured in 10% FBS, 1% PenStrep
DMEM. BHK or VeroE6 cells were plated into 12 well plates at a density of 0.3 x 106 for
16 hours. BHK cells were either not transfected or transfected with 0.8 µg ACE2 per
well using standard lipofectamine2000 (Life Technologies) protocols and incubated for
another 16 hours. Concentrated pseudovirus was added to the wells after washing 3X
with DMEM. After 2-3 hours 20% FBS and 2% PenStrep containing DMEM was added
to the cells for 48 hours. Following the 48 hr infection, One-Glo-EX (Promega) was
added to the cells in equivalent culturing volume and incubated in the dark for 10
minutes prior to reading on a Varioskan LUX plate reader (ThermoFisher).
Measurements were done in triplicate and relative luciferase units (RLU) were plotted.

Biolayer interferometry
Assays were performed on an Octet Red (ForteBio) instrument at 30˚C with shaking at
1,000 RPM. Anti-penta His biosensors were hydrated in water for 30 minutes prior to a
1 min incubation in 10X kinetics buffer (undiluted). Either SARS-CoV-2 SB or SARS-CoV
SB were loaded at 10-20 µg/mL in 10X Kinetics Buffer for 200-900 seconds prior to
baseline equilibration for 180 seconds in 10X kinetics buffer. Association in 10X kinetics
buffer diluted ACE2 at various concentrations in a two-fold dilution series from 20nM to
2.5nM was carried out for 1,000 seconds prior to dissociation at 10X kinetics buffer for
1,000 seconds. The data were baseline subtracted prior to fitting performed using a 1:1
binding model and the ForteBio data analysis software. Mean kon, koff values were
determined with a global fit applied to all data. The experiments were done with two
separate purification batches of SARS-CoV SB, SARS-CoV-2-SB, and ACE2 in triplicate
and the average is reported.

cultures were transfected using 293fectin (ThermoFisher Scientific) with cells grown to a
density of 1 million cells per mL and cultivated for three days. The supernatants were
harvested and cells resuspended for another three days, yielding two harvests. Clarified
supernatants were purified using a 5mL Cobalt affinity column (Takara). Purified protein
was filtered or concentrated and flash frozen in Tris-saline (50 mM Tris pH 8.0, 150 mM
NaCl) prior to negative staining and cryo-EM analysis.
Cryo-EM sample preparation and data collection.
3 µL of 0.16 mg/mL SARS-CoV-2 S was loaded onto a freshly glow discharged (30 s at
20 mA) lacey carbon grid with a thin layer of evaporated continuous carbon prior to
plunge freezing using a vitrobot MarkIV (ThermoFisher Scientific) using a blot force of -1
and 2.5 second blot time at 100% humidity and 25°C. Data were acquired using the
Leginon software (Suloway et al., 2005) to control an FEI Titan Krios transmission
electron microscope operated at 300 kV and equipped with a Gatan K2 Summit direct
detector and Gatan Quantum GIF energy filter, operated in zero-loss mode with a slit
width of 20 eV. Automated data collection was carried out using Leginon at a nominal
magnification of 130,000x with a pixel size of 0.525 Å. The dose rate was adjusted to 8
counts/pixel/s, and each movie was acquired in super-resolution mode fractionated in
50 frames of 200 ms. 3,000 micrographs were collected in a single session with a
defocus range comprised between 1.0 and 2.5 μm.
CryoEM data processing
Movie frame alignment, estimation of the microscope contrast-transfer function
parameters, particle picking and extraction were carried out using Warp (Tegunov and
Cramer, 2019). Particle images were extracted with a box size of 800 binned to 400
yielding a pixel size of 1.05 Å. For each data set two rounds of reference-free 2D
classification were performed using cryoSPARC (Punjani et al., 2017) to select welldefined particle images. Subsequently, two rounds of 3D classification with 50 iterations
each (angular sampling 7.5˚ for 25 iterations and 1.8˚ with local search for 25 iterations)
were carried out using Relion (Zivanov et al., 2018) without imposing symmetry to
separate distinct SARS-CoV-2 S conformations. 3D refinements were carried out using

non-uniform refinement in cryoSPARC (Punjani et al., 2017) using an ab initio model
generated using cryoSPARC. Particle images were subjected to Bayesian polishing
(Zivanov et al., 2019) before performing another round of on-uniform refinement in
cryoSPARC (Punjani et al., 2017) followed by per-particle defocus refinement and again
non-uniform refinement. Local resolution estimation, filtering and sharpening was
carried out using CryoSPARC. Reported resolutions are based on the gold-standard
Fourier shell correlation (FSC) of 0.143 criterion and Fourier shell correlation curves
were corrected for the effects of soft masking by high-resolution noise substitution
(Scheres and Chen, 2012).
CryoEM model building and analysis.
UCSF Chimera (Goddard et al., 2007) and Coot were used to fit atomic models (PDB
6NB6) into the cryoEM map. The model was subsequently manually rebuilt using Coot
and the C3-symmetrized map (Brown et al., 2015; Emsley et al., 2010). This model was
then used to build features specific of the C1-map. N-linked glycans were hand-built into
the density where visible and the models were refined and relaxed using Rosetta (Wang
et al., 2016). Glycan refinement relied on a dedicated Rosetta protocol, which uses
physically realistic geometries based on prior knowledge of saccharide chemical
properties (Frenz, 2019), and was aided by using both sharpened and unsharpened
maps. Models were analyzed using MolProbity (Chen et al., 2010) and privateer (Agirre
et al., 2015). Figures were generated using UCSF ChimeraX (Goddard et al., 2018).
Immunizations with SARS-CoV S
57BL/6J mice were obtained from the Jackson Laboratory and maintained at the
Comparative Medicine Facility at the Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center. After
collecting a pre-bleed, mice were immunized with 5µg of SARS-CoV 2P S ectodomain
trimer formulated in 50µl of PBS and 50µl of Sigma Adjuvant System subcutaneously in
the base of the tail at weeks 0, 4, and 12 and bleeds were collected 2 weeks after each
immunization. Plasma from immunized animals was heat inactivated at 56ºC for 1 hour
and then stored at 4ºC until use. All experiments were conducted at the Fred
