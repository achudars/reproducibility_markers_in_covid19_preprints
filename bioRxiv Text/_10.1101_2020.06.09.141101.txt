Abstract
Tightly packed complexes of nucleocapsid protein and genomic RNA form the core of
viruses and may assemble within viral factories, dynamic compartments formed within
the host cells. Here, we examine the possibility that the multivalent RNA-binding
nucleocapsid protein (N) from the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus
(SARS-CoV-2) compacts RNA via protein-RNA liquid-liquid phase separation (LLPS)
and that N interactions with host RNA-binding proteins are mediated by phase
separation. To this end, we created a construct expressing recombinant N fused to a Nterminal maltose binding protein tag which helps keep the oligomeric N soluble for
purification. Using in vitro phase separation assays, we find that N is assembly-prone
and phase separates avidly. Phase separation is modulated by addition of RNA and
changes in pH and is disfavored at high concentrations of salt. Furthermore, N enters
into in vitro phase separated condensates of full-length human hnRNPs (TDP-43, FUS,
and hnRNPA2) and their low complexity domains (LCs). However, N partitioning into the

LC of FUS, but not TDP-43 or hnRNPA2, requires cleavage of the solubilizing MBP
fusion. Hence, LLPS may be an essential mechanism used for SARS-CoV-2 and other
RNA viral genome packing and host protein co-opting, functions necessary for viral
replication and hence infectivity.
Introduction
The spread of the highly infectious severe acute respiratory syndrome
coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is responsible for the ongoing global pandemic of
Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19)1. The novel SARS-CoV-2 is an enveloped,
nonsegmented, positive-sense, single stranded ~30 kb RNA virus of the family
Coronaviridae2. This family includes the related SARS-CoV3 and Middle East respiratory
syndrome (MERS)4 coronaviruses, which have both caused previous outbreaks of
pneumonia. Like all coronaviruses, SARS-CoV-2 forms a virion including its genomic
RNA (gRNA) packaged in a particle comprised of four structural proteins – the crownlike spike (S) glycoprotein that binds to human ACE2 receptor to mediate the entry of
the virus in the host cell5,6, the membrane (M) protein that facilitates viral assembly in
the endoplasmic reticulum, the ion channel envelope (E) protein, and the nucleocapsid
protein (N) that assembles with viral RNA to form a helical ribonucleoprotein (RNP)
complex called the nucleocapsid7,8. Though many current therapeutic efforts have
focused on disrupting viral attachment to host cells9 and preventing viral protease
function10, the molecular mechanisms that underlie the assembly of the SARS-CoV-2
nucleocapsid through the binding of nucleoprotein to RNA are poorly understood and
therefore have remained an uninvestigated target to inhibit viral replication.

Nucleocapsid protein of SARS-CoV-2 is a 46 kDa multivalent RNA-binding
protein which is predicted to have 40% of its primary sequence remaining intrinsically
disordered in addition to the two known folded domains. N has a folded N-terminal
domain that participates in RNA-binding domain (NTD) preceded by a 44-amino acid Nterminal disordered region (NIDR) and followed by a serine/arginine-rich 73-amino acid
linker (LKRIDR) (Figure 1A). The flexible linker is adjacent to the folded dimerization
domain (CTD) followed by the 52-amino C-terminal disordered tail region (CIDR) rich in
lysine and glutamine (Figure 1B). Previous studies of SARS-CoV-1 N (91% sequence
identity) have shown that both the NTD, the CTD and the disordered regions can bind
RNA cooperatively to promote RNP packaging11 and chaperoning12. The structural
details of these protein-RNA interactions are beginning to come into focus. A recent
solution NMR structure of SARS-CoV-2 NTD-RNA complex suggested a right hand-like
fold and highlights the role of arginine motifs and electrostatic interactions13.
Furthermore, superimposition of the unbound state with previously solved coronavirus
nucleoproteins bound to RNA revealed some potential protein-RNA recognition
interactions involving Arg89, Tyr110 and Tyr112 in nitrogenous base binding14. The role
of NTD in viral genome packaging has been investigated in HCoV-OC43 N-NTD15 and
mouse hepatitis virus (MHV) N-NTD which organizes gRNA via specific interactions with
a packaging signal (PS) located 20.3 kb from the 5’ end of gRNA16. Importantly, the
higher-order assembly of coronavirus N proteins has also begun to be examined. The
CTD dimerization domain of SARS-CoV has been suggested to organize into an
octamer stabilized via electrostatic interactions enhanced by phosphorylation17 to
promote superhelical packaging of viral RNA18.

In recent years, liquid-liquid phase separation (LLPS) has emerged as a common
cellular process to organize biological material into compartments. Many of these
biomolecular condensates assembled by LLPS are multicomponent phases composed
of multivalent RNA-binding proteins containing intrinsically disordered regions (IDRs)
and RNA19. Biomolecular condensates are thought to be formed by weak, multivalent
interactions to sequester and concentrate proteins involved in RNA processing, stress
response and gene silencing20. In eukaryotes, histone proteins are known to promote
the compaction of chromatin into condensates21. Bacterial nucleoprotein complexes
also have been shown to organize genomic DNA via phase separation22, suggesting
that LLPS may serve to organize genome packaging across the domains of life. Recent
evidence suggests that similar higher order genome organization is also present in
viruses. For example, the measles virus nucleoprotein (MeV N) assembles with
genomic RNA into a rigid helical capsid23 which also undergoes LLPS in the presence of
the phosphoprotein (P)24. Like the eukaryotic heterochromatin protein 1 (HP1) which
bridges chromatin regions and can undergo LLPS25, SARS-CoV-2 N is oligomeric with
multiple binding sites for the genomic nucleic acid separated by disordered
linkers. Hence, it is important to understand if SARS-CoV-2 N could also use phase
separation to organize its genome.
Furthermore, viruses have long been known to hijack the host cell environment to
facilitate gRNA transport from the site of viral genome replication to the site of viral
assembly and maximize the replication efficiency by disrupting the organization of
cellular organelles26,27. A recent study on the network of protein-protein contacts formed
by SARS-CoV-2 structural proteins shows that N interacts with several human

ribonucleoproteins known to be involved in the formation of phase-separated proteinRNA granules28. Several of these proteins such as G3BP1/2 are composed of
disordered regions with sequence characteristics that are known to contribute to stress
granule formation via LLPS29,30. Stress granules (SGs) are membraneless organelles
that store translationally silent mRNA when the cell is exposed to stress to regulate
mRNA metabolism31. Numerous studies have shown viral invasion can interfere with SG
formation32 via inhibition of post translational modifications33, exclusion of SG
components such as TIA-1 and G3BP34,35, and formation of stable viral RNP complexes
with SG vital proteins36. Hence, it would be important to understand if SARS-CoV-2 N
can enter phase-separated assemblies formed by other ubiquitous, well-characterized
SG human proteins. Here, we examine the phase separation of N in vitro as a function
of solution condition and RNA concentration. Furthermore, we test the partitioning of N
into phase separated droplets formed by intact human ribonucleoproteins or their
disordered domains.
Results
N forms higher order oligomers
The SARS-CoV nucleocapsid protein contains multiple regions implicated in selfinteractions17,37–39, so we first sought to determine if the SARS-CoV-2 nucleocapsid
protein (N) was capable of higher order assembly. We purified recombinant full-length
SARS-CoV-2 N with a TEV protease cleavable N-terminal maltose binding protein
(MBP) tag to enhance solubility, due to previous studies showing that the N RNA
complex was largely insoluble11. Even with the solubility tag, some of the N protein
deposited into inclusion bodies during bacterial expression (data not shown). However,

purification of MBP-N from the soluble fraction was efficient at high salt concentration
via standard immobilized metal affinity chromatography. The chromatogram from
subsequent gel filtration chromatography of both MBP-tagged and cleaved (tag
removed) N have major absorbance peaks eluting much earlier than would be expected
of their monomeric species (90 kDa, expected at about 230 mL and 46 kDa expected at
about 240 mL, respectively) (Figure 2A). When analyzed by SDS-PAGE, the fractions
containing these peaks correspond to the MBP-N and cleaved N respectively with some
minor degradation products but no species of greater molecular weight (Figure 2B, C).
These data imply that N is capable of stable self-assembly.
N undergoes LLPS in vitro
The SARS-CoV nucleocapsid protein associates with viral genomic RNA to form
a ribonucleoparticle and is enriched in serine and arginine residues40,41, a characteristic
of some proteins that can undergo LLPS. We hypothesized that N is able to form liquidlike compartments to sequester RNA. To test if N is able to phase separate, we
prepared samples containing MBP-tagged full-length N at a variety of conditions, added
TEV, and measured the resulting turbidity of the solution coupled with microscopy as we
have done for previous studies of LLPS-prone proteins42. First, we tested whether N
could undergo LLPS in a variety of pH conditions in the presence and absence of torula
yeast RNA extract (desalted to remove ions and small RNA pieces) (Figure 3). Like in
our previous work examining the impact of RNA binding on phase separation of FUS
which binds many RNA sequences and structures43, we used RNA extract as N has
been shown to bind with little specificity to nucleic acids including ssRNA, ssDNA and
dsDNA11,38. At pH 7.4, mixtures containing 50 μM MBP-N with 0.3 mg/mL RNA in the

presence of TEV protease displays initial increased turbidity over time (Figure 3A)
followed by a decrease, characteristic for the formation of turbid droplet assemblies
triggered by TEV cleavage which then fuse and settle44,45. This increase in turbidity is
coupled with the appearance of small, spherical droplets visible by microscopy (Figure
3B). Interestingly, at lower pH conditions the turbidity of the reaction increases and
persists over time as has been observed for protein aggregates or gels46 (Figure
3A). At pH 5.5, the droplets still appear spherical; however, the persistent turbidity
suggests that the droplets may be less fluid (more “gel-like”) in these conditions.
Consistent with this hypothesis, at lower pH conditions the assemblies no longer remain
spherical and resemble droplets that were unable to complete fusion (SI Figure 1A).
Further, addition of MgCl2 or CaCl2 does not substantially alter LLPS of N (SI Figure 2),
demonstrating that presence of divalent metal ions does not affect LLPS. Together,
these data suggest that SARS-CoV2 N is able to undergo LLPS at physiological buffer
conditions.
N LLPS is modulated by RNA concentration and ionic strength
Because RNA is involved in the assembly of the viral RNP, we sought to
determine if RNA concentration and interactions were important for droplet assembly.
We conducted turbidity and microscopy experiments with fixed protein concentration
and varying protein:RNA mass ratios in low salt conditions (Figure 4A,C). In low salt
conditions in the absence of RNA, there is an increase in turbidity along the formation of
small, spherical droplets, suggesting that N is able to undergo LLPS even in the
absence of RNA (Figure 4A,C). At conditions of 1:0.25 MBP-N:RNA, the turbidity of the
solution is enhanced compared to the no RNA control (Figure 4A). Interestingly, at

higher RNA concentrations turbidity and droplet formation are diminished (Figure
4A,C), a characteristic of reentrant phase separation behavior47. To test if the
electrostatic interactions between N and RNA are important for phase separation, we
measured turbidity accompanied by microscopy of solutions containing varying sodium
chloride concentrations (Figure 4B,D). We found that at higher salt concentrations (300
mM and 1M), both turbidity and droplet formation was reduced (Figure 4B). Together,
these data show protein-RNA interactions stimulate N phase separation and suggest
that screening out the electrostatic interactions between N and RNA reduces LLPS.
N partitions into hnRNPA2, TDP-43, and FUS droplets
SARS-CoV-2 N interacts with stress granule proteins28 and the interaction
between one stress granule protein, hnRNPA1, and SARS-CoV-1 N has been
examined with biochemical detail37. As we have previously shown co-partitioning of
many granule-associated heterogenous nuclear ribonucleoproteins (hnRNPs) into liquid
phases including intermixing of FUS, hnRNPA2, and TDP-4345,48, we decided to test if
full length N could partition into liquid phases formed by hnRNPA2, FUS, and TDP-43.
We used conditions where N does not phase separate on its own (i.e. ~5 nM
concentration with no RNA) to be sure that N was the “client” and the hnRNP was the
“scaffold” protein, following common terminology to classify the molecules as drivers
(“scaffold”) or partitioning members (“clients”) of phase separation, respectively49,50. We
found that N partitions into hnRNPA2 LC and TDP-43 CTD droplets even when
attached to the maltose binding protein (MBP) solubility tag (Figure 5A-B). In contrast,
MBP-N did not partition into FUS LC (Figure 5C), suggesting a weaker interaction with
FUS LC than with TDP-43 CTD or hnRNPA2 LC. However, N did partition into FUS LC

droplets when cleaved from MBP (Figure 5C). We further tested whether N could
partition into droplets formed by the full- length hnRNPs. We found that N was able to
partition into full- length hnRNPA2, FUS, and TDP-43 droplets (Figure 5D-F). As the
hnRNPs are only able to undergo LLPS after cleavage of the MBP solubility tag, we
could not observe partitioning of MBP-N and hnRNPs. These results indicate that N can
interact with and partition into liquid phases formed by many human RNA-binding
proteins, suggesting the presence of weak protein-protein interactions.
Discussion
Virion assembly requires the formation of dense protein-nucleic acid
compartments that sequester host cell proteins as a means of protection from the host
immune system and concentrate viral components to increase the efficiency of
replication26. Previous studies on herpes virus have reported the existence of
perinuclear and cytoplasmic puncta in infected cells called prereplicative sites51,52. Apart
from SARS CoV-1 and SARS-CoV-2, a vast number of viruses like paramyxoviruses53,
flaviviruses54, and mononegaviruses such as rabies55,56, influenza A virus57,58 and Lassa
virus59 are also known to hijack their host cellular machinery via their highly disordered
nucleoprotein with some of them resulting to the formation of cytoplasmic puncta such
as the Negri bodies of Mononegavirales56. Most recently, the co-phase separation of
full-length nucleoprotein (N) and phosphoprotein (P) of measles virus (MeV) was shown
to require both the folded and the disordered domain of N, highlighting the importance
of LLPS during MeV replication24. Understanding the mechanisms that underlie LLPS of
SARS-CoV-2 N is essential to identify key potentially targetable steps in the viral
replication cycle. To unravel the molecular details of this phenomenon, we tested the

ability of N protein to undergo phase separation in the presence of RNA and other
human ribonucleoproteins that are located in membraneless organelles of the
eukaryotic cytoplasm and nucleoplasm60.
Here, we found that N of SARS-CoV-2 is able to phase separate and its phase
behavior is tuned by pH, salt, and RNA concentration. At physiological conditions (pH =
7.4, NaCl = 183 mM), we observed the formation of in vitro N droplets after addition of
TEV protease and 0.3 mg/ml desalted total torula yeast RNA. Remarkably, at lower pH
values, the turbidity of the RNA-protein mixtures increased monotonically, and the
droplets persisted, albeit the sphericity and the fluidity were diminished (SI Figure 1).
After determining conditions where N phase separates, we tested the dependence of
LLPS on RNA and salt concentration. Surprisingly, we found in the absence of RNA at
100 mM NaCl, N formed small spherical droplets. At 1:0.25 protein:RNA ratio, the size
and the sphericity of the droplets further increased. However, higher RNA ratios
eliminated phase separation, suggesting that N of SARS-CoV-2 exhibits RNA-mediated
phase-behavior typical of many liquid-like transcriptional machineries with reentrant
phase transition47. Lastly, we tested the effect of ionic strength on LLPS of N and we
showed that at higher salt concentrations (300 mM, 1 M), N no longer phase separates
as supported by our microscopy and turbidity data. It is unclear which domains of N are
essential for phase separation, although previous studies on N of SARS-CoV-1 have
shown that the NTD18, the CTD61, and the disordered linker can bind RNA cooperatively
with a degree of specificity being attributed to the positive electrostatic surface of these
regions. Thus, here we demonstrate that the nucleocapsid protein from a virus of the
Coronaviridae family undergoes phase separation with RNA in vitro.

Recent proteomic studies have constructed a putative SARS-CoV-2 protein
interaction map where many RNA processing factors and stress granule regulation
factors like G3BP1/229 have been delineated as crucial nodes of the N interactome28. In
addition, early reports on molecules interacting with N of SARS-CoV-1 highlighted high
binding affinity to granule-associated proteins – hnRNPA137, the stress-granule and
phase-separating protein62; nucleophosmin (nucleolar phosphoprotein B23)63, the
primary component of the phase separated liquid granular component of the
nucleolus64, and cyclophilinA65, the hnRNP chaperone66. During the steps of genomic
replication in the infected cells, the local concentration of cellular organelles is altered
dramatically by the shuttling of the replication complexes in the cytoplasm and the
anchorage of the structural proteins to the cellular membranes7. We hypothesized that
N facilitates SARS-CoV-2 replication by recruiting stress granule components present in
the host cellular environment. Here, we identified the interaction between full-length N of
SARS-CoV-2 and human ribonucleoproteins like FUS, hnRNPA2 and TDP-43 full-length
and their respective low complexity domains. It is possible that abundant host
cytoplasmic proteins, like these hnRNPs, serve as scaffolds to promote the formation of
multicomponent dense N-RNA phases to enable or accelerate viral replication. Given
that we have shown here the potential role of phase separation in stabilizing
nucleocapsid formation and the ability of viral nucleocapsid proteins to enter phase
separated assemblies formed by host cell RNA-binding proteins, it will be important to
investigate if therapies targeting viral or host condensates could disrupt cycles of SARSCoV-2 replication.

MBP-N full-length expression and purification
MBP-tagged (pTHMT) full-length SARS-CoV2 nucleocapsid protein was expressed in
Escherichia coli BL21 Star (DE3) cells (Life Technologies). Bacterial cultures were
grown to an optical density of 0.7 to 0.9 before induction with 1 mM isopropyl-β-D-1thiogalactopyranoside (IPTG) for 4 hrs at 37°C. Cell pellets were harvested by
centrifugation and stored at -80°C. Cell pellets were resuspended in 20 mM Tris 1M
NaCl 10 mM imidazole pH 8.0 with one EDTA-free protease inhibitor tablet (Roche) and
lysed using an Emulsiflex C3 (Avestin). The lysate was cleared by centrifugation at
20,000 rpm for 50 min at 4°C, filtered using a 0.2 μm syringe filter, and loaded onto a
HisTrap HP 5 mL column. The protein was eluted with a gradient from 10 to 300 mM
imidazole in 20 mM Tris 1.0 M NaCl pH 8.0. Fractions containing MBP-N full-length
were loaded onto a HiLoad 26/600 Superdex 200 pg column equilibrated in 20 mM Tris
1.0 M NaCl pH 8.0. Fractions with high purity were identified by SDS-PAGE and
concentrated using a centrifugation filter with a 10 kDa cutoff (Amicon, Millipore).

HisTrap HP 5 mL column and flow through fractions containing cleaved N full-length
were loaded onto a HiLoad 26/600 Superdex 200 pg column equilibrated in 20 mM Tris
1.0 M NaCl pH 8.0. Fractions from gel filtration were analyzed by SDS-PAGE.

hnRNPA2 LC45, MBP-hnRNPA2 FL48, TDP-43 CTD67, MBP-TDP-43 FL68, FUS LC42,
and MBP-FUS FL44 were purified as described.
AlexaFluor labeling
Proteins were labeled with NHS-ester AlexaFluor dyes by diluting protein stocks into 20
mM HEPES pH 8.3 1 M NaCl (for N, hnRNPA2 FL, TDP-43 FL, and FUS FL) or 20 mM
HEPES pH 8 with 8 M urea (FUS LC, hnRNPA2 LC, TDP-43 CTD). AlexaFluor
dissolved in DMSO was added at less than 10% total reaction volume. Reactions were
incubated for an hour and unreacted AlexaFluor was removed by desalting with 1 mL
Zeba spin desalting columns equilibrated in the appropriate buffer for protein solubility.
Labeled proteins were then concentrated and buffer exchanged into appropriate storage
buffers and flash frozen.

appropriate buffer using a Zeba 0.5 mL spin column) torula yeast RNA extract in the
appropriate buffer conditions. To test the effect of different salt concentrations on LLPS,
the experiments were conducted in 50 mM Tris pH 7.4 with 60 mM, 100 mM, 300 mM or
1000 mM NaCl with 1.1 mg/mL desalted torula yeast RNA extract. To test the effect of
RNA on LLPS, the experiments were conducted in 50 mM Tris 100 mM NaCl pH 7.4
with 0, 1.1 or 2.3 mg/mL desalted torula yeast RNA extract. Turbidity experiments were
performed in a 96-well clear plate (Costar) with 70 μL samples sealed with optical
adhesive film to prevent evaporation (MicroAmp, ThermoFisher). The absorbance at
600 nm was monitored over time using a Cytation 5 Cell Imaging Multi-Mode Reader
(BioTek) at 5 min time intervals for up to 12 hr with mixing. To subtract background
noise, the turbidity of a no TEV control (i.e. replaced with TEV storage buffer) for each
condition was subtracted from the turbidity of the experimental conditions. Experiments
were conducted in triplicate and averaged.
DIC microscopy
For 50 μΜ MBP-N full-length, the samples were incubated with 0.03 mg/mL in-house
TEV protease for 20 min before visualization. Samples were spotted onto a glass
coverslip and droplet formation was evaluated by imaging with differential interference
contrast on an Axiovert 200M microscopy (Zeiss).
hnRNP mixing microscopy
Each protein was prepared for microscopy based on our previously established
methods for that protein42,44,45,48,67,68. Briefly: hnRNPA2 was diluted from 8 M urea into
the appropriate buffer to a final concentration of 150 mM urea and appropriate protein
concentration; hnRNPA2 FL with a C-terminal MBP tag was diluted from 1 M NaCl to 50

Fluorescence confocal microscopy images were taken on an LSM 880 (Zeiss).
AlexaFluor-tagged proteins were doped in at 0.2 µL (~5 nM final concentration) to
prevent oversaturation of the detector. Snapshots were taken of the red, green, and
brightfield channels and merged using ImageJ (NIH).

Figure 2: MBP-CoV-2 N and cleaved CoV-2 N elute larger than their predicted
molecular weights. A) Gel filtration chromatogram of ~7ml of ~500 μM MBP tagged
CoV-2 N (top) and ~300μl ~50 μM CoV-2 N (previously cleaved from MBP) (bottom).
Vertical lines represent peak elution volumes of gel filtration protein calibration
standards. Brackets represent range of gels lanes. Predicted molecular weight of the
tagged and untagged N are 90 kDa and 46 kDa respectively, much smaller than their
corresponding calibrated peak elution volumes, consistent with oligomerization. B) SDSPAGE showing the peak fractions of the MBP-CoV-2 N chromatogram showing
expected 90 kDa MW. C) SDS-PAGE showing the peak fractions of the cleaved CoV-2
N chromatogram showing expected 46 kDa MW. Circular feature in SDS-PAGE gels is
