Abstract
Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2), the etiological agent
of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), is transmitted person-to-person via respiratory
droplets and, likely, via smaller droplet nuclei light enough to remain suspended in the air
for hours and contaminate surfaces particularly in indoor conditions. Thus, effective
measures are needed to prevent SARS-CoV-2 transmission in indoor environments. In this
regard, we have investigated whether a system based on a filter combining Tungsten
Trioxide-Based (WO3) photocatalysis and an antiviral fabric treated-copper nanocluster
could inactivate SARS-CoV-2. To this purpose, an infectious SARS-CoV-2 suspension was
introduced in the upper opening of a closed cylinder containing a WO3 filter and a lightbased system that activates WO3 and the antiviral fabric. From the bottom exit, aliquots of
fluid were collected every 10 min (up to 60 min) and tested for their infectivity by means of
a viral plaque assay in Vero cells whereas, in parallel, the viral RNA content was measured
by quantitative PCR (qPCR). As we have previously shown for SARS-CoV, a 1:1,000 ratio of
plaque forming units (PFU) vs. viral RNA copies was observed also for SARS-CoV-2. After 10
min, the infectious viral content was already decreased by 98.2% reaching 100% inactivation
after 30 min whereas the SARS-CoV-2 RNA load was decreased of 1.5 log10 after 30 min.
Thus, in spite of only a partial decrease of viral RNA, SARS-CoV-2 infectivity was completely
abolished by the WO3 photocatalysis system by 30 min. These results support the
hypothesis that this system could be exploited to achieve SARS-CoV-2 inactivation in indoor
environments.

Introduction
At the end of 2019, a novel severe respiratory disease (coronavirus disease 2019,
COVID-19) emerged in Wuhan, China and has since become pandemic in a few months,
with

more

than

17

million

of

people

infected

worldwide

as

of

today

(https://gisanddata.maps.arcgis.com/apps/opsdashboard/index.html#/bda7594740fd40299
423467b48e9ecf6). COVID-19 is caused by a novel coronavirus called severe acute
respiratory syndrome (SARS) CoV-2 to distinguish it from SARS-CoV that emerged in
Guangdong province in China in 2003 and caused the severe clinical condition known as
SARS. Like SARS-CoV, SARS-CoV-2 causes a severe interstitial pneumonia that can lead to
acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) and death [1]. However, unlike SARS-CoV, SARSCoV-2 can also cause a multi-organ disease with hypercoagulation but also mild symptoms
limited to the infection of the upper respiratory tract [2]. Indeed, high viral loads have been
detected in the nasal swabs even in the presence of mild symptoms or in asymptomatic
individuals [3-5] who can shed and transmit the infection while asymptomatic.
SARS-CoV-2 route of transmission is not yet completely defined as airborne
transmission is still debatable [6]. Droplets are expelled when a person speaks, particularly
with a loud voice [7], coughs and sneezes [8] whereas aerosols originate from dissemination
of droplet nuclei [9]. Both droplets and aerosols have been shown to contain SARS-CoV-2
suggesting that they are a potential source of infectious virus although virus infectivity has
not been yet determined [10]. As droplets are classically described as larger entities (>5 µm)
as compared with aerosols (<5 µm), they quickly drop to the surfaces and ground by force of
gravity whereas aerosols remain suspended in the air for a longer time [11]. Indeed,
experimental studies have shown that SARS-CoV-2 virions can remain infectious in aerosol
for hours and on inert surfaces up to days [12]. Furthermore, during SARS-CoV pandemic in
2003, a major route of transmission was identified in aerosols generated in the sewing
systems as observed in an apartment building in Hong Kong, suggesting that not only
infected droplets, but also droplet nuclei, can be a source of infectious virus [13]. As most
secondary cases have been reported in indoor environments [6], the need for systems that
inactivate infectious virions present in droplets and droplets nuclei has become a priority to
prevent spreading infection.
Virus inactivation by physical means has been extensively studied, as reviewed in
[14]. In particular, photocatalysis is the natural phenomenon by which a photocatalyst

accelerates the speed of a chemical reaction through the action of either natural or artificial
light [15]. The main applications use titanium dioxide (TiO2)-based photocatalysts that need
to be exposed to UV light in order to be activated [16]. In this regard, the development of a
new Tungsten Trioxide-Based (WO3)-based photocatalyst has significantly increased the
effectiveness of photocatalysis and eliminated the need of UV light irradiation [17]. When
exposed to light in the visible spectrum, WO3 absorbs and converts light energy into
electrons and electron gaps. WO3 reacts with water (air humidity) and oxygen to create
hydroxyl (OH-) and superoxide anions (O2-) [18]. Billions of these reactive oxygen
intermediates (ROI) are generated and can damage membranes of bacteria, cells and tissues
[19]. The ultimate result is an effective decomposition of microorganisms like viruses and
bacteria, organic and inorganic pollutants, nitrogen oxides, poly-condensed aromatics,
sulfur dioxide, carbon monoxide, formaldehyde, methanol, ethanol, benzene, ethylbenzene
and other Volatile Organic Compounds (VOC) [20]. The strong oxidative effect of WO3
tungsten trioxide photocatalyst provides the rationale to explore it as a disinfectant of air
and solid surfaces. Although many studies have been reported on photocatalytic
inactivation of bacteria, however only a few studies have addressed virus inactivation [21].
Here, we have evaluated whether a WO3 based photocatalyst system could interfere
with SARS-CoV-2 infectivity.

Methods
The photocatalytic system used in this study is in liquid phase and relies on the
combination of two elements developed in order to improve SARS-CoV-2 inactivation: a
metallic mesh filter coated with WO3 and a cotton fabric soaked in a metallic nanocluster
based (CuNh) on a copper solution (colloidal suspension).
The SARS-CoV-2 stock (GISAID accession ID: EPI_ISL_413489) was diluted 1:100 to
4

obtain 80 ml of viral suspension with an infectious titer of 1.7x10 plaque forming units
(PFU)/ml. The viral suspension was introduced into the device from its top and aliquots
were collected at the bottom every 10 min up to 60 min. The collected viral suspension was
then tested for the presence of infectious virus as determined by a previously optimized
plaque assay on Vero cells [22] and quantification of viral RNA by real-time PCR, described
below.

SARS-CoV-2 plaque assay

Vero cells were seeded at 1.5x10 cell/well in 6-well plates in Eagle’s Minimum
Essential Medium (EMEM) supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum (complete medium).
Twenty-four h later, 1:10 serial dilutions of virus containing suspension collected at various
times after processing by the device were incubated with Vero cells for 60 min. Cell
supernatants were then discarded and 1% methylcellulose (1.5 ml/well) dissolved in
complete medium was added to each well. After 3 days, cells were fixed with
formaldehyde/PBS solution (6%) and stained with crystal violet (1%; Sigma Chemical Corp.)
in 70% methanol. Viral plaques were counted under a stereoscopic microscope (SMZ-1500,
Nikon), as published [22]. Viral titers were expressed as PFU/ml.

SARS-CoV-2 quantitative PCR
Viral RNA was extracted from the viral suspension collected at different time points
after processing by the device. Viral RNA was extracted by using QIAamp Viral RNA Mini Kit
(Qiagen). Real-time quantitative PCR (qPCR) for the nucleocapsid (N) gene was next
performed to determine the viral RNA copies present after inactivation. The viral RNA
quantification was carried out with the Quanty COVID-19 Kit (Clonit, Milan, Italy) that
includes a reference curve of viral RNA at known copy number with a 7500 Fast Real-Time
PCR System (Applied Biosystems).

Statistical analysis
Prism GraphPad software v. 8.0 (www.graphpad.com) was used for all statistical

(ANOVA) and the Bonferroni’s multiple comparison test. Comparison between two
homogenous groups was performed by a paired t-test.

Results and Discussion
The kinetics of infectious virus, as expressed in PFU/ml, indicates that, after 10 min,
the WO3 device inactivated SARS-CoV-2 infectious titers by 98.2% and reached 100%
inactivation after 30 min (Figure 1).
We next evaluated the amount of viral RNA by qPCR; as shown in

Figure 2A, the

levels of viral RNA in the inoculum were ca. 1,000-fold higher than the infectious titers
measured in PFU/ml consistently with previous observations with SARS-CoV [23]. Indeed,
the WO3 inactivation system progressively and significantly reduced the amount of
detectable viral RNA (Figure

2B), although not as efficiently as in the case of PFU

inactivation.
Thus, our study supports the hypothesis that a technological device could be
potentially exploited for the efficient elimination of infectious SARS-CoV-2, and potentially
of other viruses, from the air particularly in close environments where people live, work and
spend their time.
The WO3 photocatalyst generates a large number of ROI that react very rapidly
and efficiently with proteins, lipids and nucleic acids [24]. The destruction of viral proteins,
particularly the spike protein that protrudes out of the envelope and the other envelope
proteins (i.e. envelope (E) and membrane (M)) likely explains the rapid inactivation of SARSCoV-2 infectivity. It is tentative to speculate that the generated ROI damage the virion
envelope causing the release of genomic RNA, the internal component of viral particles.
However, this phenomenon is less efficient than the destruction of the viral protein as
genomic RNA is well preserved inside the virion packaged by the tightly bound nucleocapsid
protein that likely exerts a shield effect [25].
In comparison to other devices, such as those based on UV light, this system has
the advantage to be used safely in the presence of people. All reactions (e.g. virus
inactivation and disintegration of other substances) take place in the filter without the
release of substances that could be potential hazardous to human and animal health.
Furthermore, this system has minimum maintenance requirements and low electricity
consumption. Although the test was carried out in liquid solution through SARS-CoV-2
contact with the photocatalytic filter and antiviral tissue, it is highly likely that the same
results would be obtained with an air treatment device that uses the same filtration system
in indoor environments.

In conclusion, this system has the potential to significantly reduce SARS-CoV-2
infectious titer in the air of indoor environments and, consequently, the contamination of
inert surfaces thus contributing to a more general containment of the pandemics in synergy
with social distancing and individual measures of protection and hygiene.
