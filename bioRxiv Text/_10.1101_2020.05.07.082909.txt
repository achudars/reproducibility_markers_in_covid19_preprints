Abstract

23

Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is the cause of the ongoing

24

Coronavirus disease 19 (COVID-19) pandemic 1,2. In order to understand SARS-CoV-2

25

pathogenicity and antigenic potential, and to develop diagnostic and therapeutic tools, it is

26

essential to portray the full repertoire of its expressed proteins. The SARS-CoV-2 coding

27

capacity map is currently based on computational predictions and relies on homology to other

28

coronaviruses. Since coronaviruses differ in their protein array, especially in the variety of

29

accessory proteins, it is crucial to characterize the specific collection of SARS-CoV-2 proteins in

30

an unbiased and open-ended manner. Utilizing a suite of ribosome profiling techniques 3–8 , we

31

present a high-resolution map of the SARS-CoV-2 coding regions, allowing us to accurately

32

quantify the expression of canonical viral open reading frames (ORF)s and to identify 23 novel

33

unannotated viral translated ORFs. These ORFs include upstream ORFs (uORFs) that are likely

34

playing a regulatory role, several in-frame internal ORFs lying within existing ORFs, resulting in

35

N-terminally truncated products, as well as internal out-of-frame ORFs, which generate novel

36

polypeptides. We further show that viral mRNAs are not translated more efficiently than host

37

mRNAs; rather, virus translation dominates host translation due to high levels of viral

38

transcripts. Overall, our work reveals the full coding capacity of SARS-CoV-2 genome,

39

providing a rich resource, which will form the basis of future functional studies and diagnostic

40

efforts.

42

Main:

43

SARS-CoV-2 is an enveloped virus consisting of a positive-sense, single-stranded RNA genome

44

of ~30 kb and shows characteristic features of other coronaviruses. Upon cell entry, two

45

overlapping ORFs are translated from the positive strand genomic RNA, ORF1a and ORF1b.

46

The translation of ORF1b is mediated by a -1 frameshift that allows translation to continue into

47

ORF1b enabling the generation of continuous polypeptides which are cleaved into a total of 16

48

nonstructural proteins (NSPs) 9–11. In addition, the viral RNA-dependent RNA polymerase

49

(RdRP) uses the viral genome to produce negative-strand RNA intermediates which serve as

50

templates for the synthesis of positive-strand genomic RNA and of subgenomic RNAs 9–11. The

51

subgenomic RNAs contain a common 5' leader fused to different segments from the 3′ end of the

52

viral genome, and contain a 5′-cap structure and a 3′ poly(A) tail 12,13. These unique fusions

53

occur during negative-strand synthesis at 6-7 nt core sequences called transcription-regulating

54

sequences (TRS)s that are located at the 3' end of the leader sequence as well as preceding each

55

viral gene. The different subgenomic RNAs encode 4 conserved structural proteins- spike protein

56

(S), envelope protein (E), membrane protein (M), nucleocapsid protein (N)- and several

57

accessory proteins. Based on sequence similarity to other beta coronaviruses and specifically to

58

SARS-CoV, current annotation of SARS-CoV-2 includes predictions of six accessory proteins

59

(3a, 6, 7a, 7b, 8, and 10, NCBI Reference Sequence: NC_045512.2), but not all of these ORFs

60

have been experimentally and reproducibly confirmed in this virus14,15.

61

To capture the full SARS-CoV-2 coding capacity, we initially applied a suite of ribosome

62

profiling approaches to Vero E6 cells infected at MOI=0.2 with SARS-CoV-2

63

(BetaCoV/Germany/BavPat1/2020 EPI_ISL_406862) for 5 or 24 hours (Figure 1A). At 24 hours

64

post infection the vast majority of cells were infected but cells were still intact (Figure S1). For

65

each time point we mapped genome-wide translation events by preparing three different

66

ribosome-profiling libraries (Ribo-seq), each one in two biological replicates. Two Ribo-seq

67

libraries facilitate mapping of translation initiation sites, by treating cells with lactimidomycin

68

(LTM) or harringtonine (Harr), two drugs with distinct mechanisms that inhibit translation

69

initiation by preventing 80S ribosomes formed at translation initiation sites from elongating.

70

These treatments lead to strong accumulation of ribosomes precisely at the sites of translation

71

initiation and depletion of ribosomes over the body of the message (Figure 1A and 4,6). The third

72

Ribo-seq library was prepared from cells treated with the translation elongation inhibitor

bioRxiv preprint doi: https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.05.07.082909; this version posted August 5, 2020. The copyright holder for this preprint

73

cycloheximide (CHX), and gives a snap-shot of actively translating ribosomes across the body of

74

the translated ORF (Figure 1A). These three complementary approaches provide a powerful tool

75

for the unbiased mapping of translated ORFs. In parallel, RNA-sequencing (RNA-seq) was

76

applied to map viral transcripts. When analyzing the different Ribo-seq libraries across coding

77

regions in cellular genes, the expected distinct profiles are observed in both replicates,

78

confirming the overall quality of the libraries. Ribosome footprints displayed a strong peak at the

79

translation initiation site, which, as expected, is more pronounced in the Harr and LTM libraries,

80

while the CHX library also exhibited a distribution of ribosomes across the entire coding region

81

up to the stop codon, and its mapped footprints were enriched in fragments that align to the

82

translated frame (Figure 1B, Figure S2 and Figure S3). As expected, the RNA-seq reads were

83

uniformly distributed across coding and non-coding regions (Figure 1B and Figure S2). The

84

footprint profiles of viral coding sequences at 5 hours post infection (hpi) fit the expected profile

85

of translation, similar to the profile of cellular genes, both at the meta gene level and at the level

86

of individual genes (Figure 1C, Figure S4 and Figure S5). In addition, the footprint densities at

87

5hpi were highly reproducible between our biological replicates both at the gene level and in

88

single codon resolution on the viral genome (Figure S6). Intriguingly, the footprint profile over

89

the viral genome at 24 hpi, did not fit the expected profile of translating ribosomes and were

90

generally not affected by Harr or LTM treatments (Figure S4). To further examine the quality of

91

footprint measurements we applied a fragment length organization similarity score (FLOSS) that

92

measures the magnitude of disagreement between the footprint distribution on a given transcript

93

and the footprint distribution on canonical CDSs 16. At 5 hpi protected fragments from SARS-

94

CoV-2 transcripts showed the expected size distribution (Figure S7A) and scored well in these

95

matrices and did not differ from well-expressed human transcripts (Figure 1D). However, reads

96

from 24 hpi could be clearly distinguished from cellular annotated coding sequences (Figure 1E

97

and Figure S7B). We conclude that the footprint data from 5hpi constitutes robust and

98

reproducible ribosome footprint information but that the majority of viral protected fragments at

99

24 hpi are likely not generated by ribosome protection and may reflect additional interactions

100

that occur on the viral genome at late time points in infection.

101

A global view of RNA and CHX footprint reads mapping to the viral genome at 5hpi,

102

demonstrate an overall 5′ to 3′ increase in coverage (Figure 2A). RNA levels are essentially

103

constant across ORFs 1a and 1b, and then steadily increases towards the 3′, reflecting the

bioRxiv preprint doi: https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.05.07.082909; this version posted August 5, 2020. The copyright holder for this preprint

104

cumulative abundance of these sequences due to the nested transcription of subgenomic RNAs

105

(Figure 2A). Increased coverage is also seen at the 5′ UTR reflecting the presence of the 5′ leader

106

sequence in all subgenomic RNAs as well as the genomic RNA. Reduction in footprint density

107

between ORF1a and ORF1b reflects the proportion of ribosomes that terminate at the ORF1a

108

stop codon instead of frameshifting into ORF1b (Figure S8). By dividing the footprint density in

109

ORF1b by the density in ORF1a we estimate frameshift efficiency is 57% +/- 12%. This value is

110

comparable to the frameshift efficiency measured based on ribosome profiling of mouse hepatitis

111

virus (MHV, 48%-75%)7. On the molecular level this 57% frameshifting rate indicates NSP1-

112

NSP11 are expressed 1.8 +/- 0.4 times more than NSP12-NSP16 and this ratio likely relates to

113

the stoichiometry needed to generate SARS-CoV-2 nonstructural macromolecular complexes 17.

114

Similarly to what was seen in MHV and avian infectious bronchitis virus (IBV) 7,8, we failed to

115

see noticeable ribosome pausing before or at the frameshift site, but we identified several

116

potential pausing sites within ORF1a and in ORF1b that were reproducible between replicates

117

(Figure S8), however these will require further characterization.

118

Besides ORF1a and ORF1b, all other canonical viral ORFs are translated from subgenomic

119

RNAs. We therefore examined whether the levels of viral gene translation correlate with the

120

levels of the corresponding subgenomic RNAs. Since raw RNA-seq densities represent the

121

cumulative sum of genomic and all subgenomic RNAs, we calculated transcript abundance using

122

two approaches: deconvolution of RNA densities, in which RNA expression of each ORF is

123

calculated by subtracting the RNA read density of cumulative densities upstream to the ORF

124

region; and relative abundances of RNA reads spanning leader-body junctions of each of the

125

canonical subgenomic RNAs. ORF6, ORF7b and ORF10 obtained negative values in the RNA

126

deconvolution, probably due to their short length and relative weaker expression, which make

127

them more sensitive to inaccuracies related to library preparation biases. For ORF10 we also did

128

not detect reads spanning leader-body junctions. For all other canonical ORFs there was high

129

correlation between these two approaches (Pearson’s R = 0.897, Figure S9), and in both

130

approaches the N transcript was the most abundant transcript, in agreement with recent studies

131

15,18

132

abundances for the subgenomic RNA or deconvolution of genomic RNA in the case of ORF1a

133

and ORF1b (Figure 2B). For the majority of viral ORFs, transcript abundance correlated almost

134

perfectly with footprint densities, indicating these viral ORFs are translated in similar

. We next compared footprint densities to RNA abundance as calculated by junction

135

efficiencies (probably due to their almost identical 5’UTRs), however three ORFs were outliers.

136

The translation efficiency of ORF1a and ORF1b was significantly lower. This can stem from

137

unique features in their 5’UTR (discussed below) or from under estimation of their true

138

translation efficiency as some of the full-length RNA molecules may serve as template for

139

replication or packaging and are hence not part of the translated mRNA pool. The third outlier is

140

ORF7b for which we identified very few body-leader junctions but exhibited relatively high

141

translation. A probable explanation is that translation of ORF7b arises from ribosome leaky

142

scanning of the ORF7a transcript, as was suggested in SARS-CoV 19.

143

Recently, many transcripts derived from non-canonical junctions were identified for SARS-CoV-

144

2, some of which were abundant and were suggested to affect the viral coding potential 15,18.

145

These non-canonical junctions contain either the leader combined with 3’ fragments at

146

unexpected sites in the middle of ORFs (leader-dependent noncanonical junction) or fusion

147

between sequences that do not have similarity to the leader (leader-independent junction). We

148

estimated the frequency of these non-canonical junctions in our RNA libraries. We indeed

149

identified many non-canonical junctions and obtained excellent agreement between our RNA-seq

150

replicates for both canonical and non-canonical junctions, demonstrating these junctions are

151

often generated and mostly do not correspond to random amplification artifacts (Figure S10A,

152

S10B and Table S1). The abundance of junction-spanning reads between our data and the data of

153

Kim et al. 18, that was generated from RNA harvested from Vero cells at 24 hpi, showed

154

significant correlation (Pearson’s R = 0.816 for 24hpi, Figure S10C and S10D), illustrating many

155

of these are reproducible between experimental systems. However, 111 out of the 361 most

156

abundant leader independent junctions that were mapped by Kim et al., were not supported by

157

any read in our data, illustrating there are also substantial variations. In addition we identified 5

158

abundant leader independent junctions that were not expressed based on Kim et al. 18 (Table S2).

159

We noticed three of these junctions represent short in-frame deletions in the spike protein (5aa,

160

7aa and 10aa long) that overlap deletions that were recently described by other groups 15,20,21, in

161

which the furin-like cleavage site is deleted (Figure S11). The re-occurrence of the same

162

genomic deletion strongly supports the conclusion that this deletion is being selected for during

163

passage in Vero cells. In order to examine if any additional non-canonical junctions are derived

164

from genomic deletions we sequenced the genomic RNA of the virus we used in our infections.

165

Indeed, 50% of the genomic RNA contained a 5-10 aa deletion of the furin-like cleavage site in

bioRxiv preprint doi: https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.05.07.082909; this version posted August 5, 2020. The copyright holder for this preprint

166

the spike protein. In addition, we identified an 8aa deletion in ORF-E in 2.3% of the genomic

167

RNA, which was also observed in our RNA measurements (Table S2 and Figure 2C). When we

168

compared the frequency of junctions between 5h and 24h time points, the leader dependent

169

junctions (both canonical and non-canonical) and the genomic deletions correlated well but the

170

leader independent junctions were specifically increased at 24 hpi (Figure 2C). Recent kinetic

171

measurements show viral particles already bud out of infected Vero cells at 8 hpi 21. Therefore,

172

this time-dependent increase in non-canonical RNA junctions indicates that the leader

173

independent RNA junctions are likely associated with genomic replication. Overall, this data

174

shows a small part of the leader-independent junctions represent genomic deletions that are

175

likely selected for during cell culture passages and a larger subset of leader-independent

176

junctions probably rises during genome replication and therefore less likely to lead to changes in

177

viral transcripts.

178

Our ribosome profiling approach facilitates unbiased assessment of the full range of SARS-CoV-

179

2 translation products. Examination of SARS-CoV-2 translation as reflected by the diverse

180

ribosome footprint libraries, revealed several unannotated translated ORFs. We detected in-frame

181

internal ORFs lying within existing ORFs, resulting in N-terminally truncated product. These

182

included relatively long truncated versions of canonical ORFs, such as the one found in ORF6

183

(Figure 3A and Figure S12A), or very short truncated ORFs that likely serve an upstream ORF

184

(uORF), like truncated ORF7a that might regulate ORF7b translation (Figure 3B, Figure S12B

185

and Figure S12C). We also detected internal out-of-frame translations, that would yield novel

186

polypeptides, such as ORFs within ORF-3a (41aa and 33 aa, Figure 3C and Figure S12D) and

187

within ORF-S (39aa, Figure 3D and Figure S12E) or short ORFs that likely serve as uORFs

188

(Figure 3E and Figure S12F). Additionally, we observed a 13 amino acid extended ORF-M, in

189

addition to the canonical ORF-M, which is predicted to start at the near cognate codon AUA

190

(Figure 3F and Figure S12G and Figure S12H).

191

The presence of the annotated ORF10 was recently put into question as almost no subgenomic

192

reads were found for its corresponding transcript 18,22. Although we also did not detect

193

subgenomic RNA designated for ORF10 translation (Table S1), the ribosome footprint densities

194

indicate translation signal in ORF10 initiation (Figure 3G and Figure S12I). Interestingly, we

195

detected two putative ORFs, an upstream out of frame ORF that overlaps ORF10 initiation and

196

an in-frame internal initiation that leads to a truncated ORF10 product. Further research is

197

needed to delineate how ORFs in this region are translated and whether they have any functional

198

roles.

199

Finally, we detected four distinct initiation sites at SARS-CoV-2 5’UTR. Three of these encode

200

for uORFs that are located just upstream of ORF1a; the first initiating at an AUG (uORF1) and

201

the other two at a near cognate codons (uORF2 and extended uORF2, Figure 3H and Figure

202

S12J). These uORFs are in line with findings in other coronaviruses 7,23. The fourth site is the

203

most prominent peak in the ribosome profiling densities on the SARS-CoV-2 genome and is

204

located on a CUG codon at position 59, just 10 nucleotides upstream the TRS-leader (Figure 3I

205

and Figure S12K). The reads mapped to this site have a tight length distribution characteristic of

206

ribosome protected fragments (Figure S13A). Due to its location upstream of the TRS-leader,

207

footprints mapping to this site can potentially derive from any of the subgenomic as well as the

208

genomic RNAs. Therefore, to view this initiation in its context, we aligned the footprints to the

209

genomic RNA or to the most abundant subgenomic N transcript. On the genome and on ORF-N

210

transcript this initiation results in translation of uORFs, which on the genome will generate an

211

extension of uORF1 (Figure S13B and Figure S13C). In both transcripts, the occupancy at the

212

CUG is higher than the downstream translation signal, implying this peak might reflect

213

ribosomal pausing. Interestingly, ribosome pauses located just upstream of the TRS-leader were

214

also identified in MHV and IBV genomes 7,8. To assess the distribution of footprints at this

215

initiation on the different viral transcripts, viral transcripts were divided into three groups based

216

on their sequence similarity downstream of the leader-junction site (to allow unique footprint

217

alignment, Figure S13D). Interestingly, significantly more footprints were mapped to the group

218

that includes the genomic RNA and the subgenomic E and M transcripts, than would be expected

219

from their relative RNA abundance (Figure S13E). When only footprints that allow unique

220

mapping to genomic RNA or subgenomic M and E transcripts are used (sizes 31-33bp to

221

discriminate M from genome or E transcript, and sizes 32-33bp to discriminate E from the

222

genome) a strong enrichment of footprints that originate from the genome is observed (Figure

223

S13F). This footprint enrichment to genomic RNA suggests ribosome pausing might be more

224

prominent on the genome or that ribosomes engage with genomic RNA differently than with

225

subgenomic transcripts. The proximity of this pause to the leader-TRS, which seem to be

226

conserved in MHV and IBV 7,8, together with the relative enrichment to the viral genome raises

227

the possibility that a ribosome at this position might affect discontinuous transcription either by

228

sterically blocking the TRS-L site or by affecting RNA secondary structure. In addition,

229

ribosomes initiating at the CUG have the potential to generate uORFs or ORF extensions in the

230

different sub-genomic transcripts (Table S3)

231

To systematically define the SARS-CoV-2 translated ORFs we used PRICE and ORF-RATER,

232

two computational methods that rely on a combination of translation features such as LTM and

233

Harr induced peak at the translation initiation site, heightened footprints density and 3-

234

nt periodicity to predict novel translated ORFs from ribosome profiling measurements 24,25. After

235

application of a minimal expression cutoff and manual curation on the predictions, these

236

classifiers identified 25 ORFs, these included 10 out of the 11 canonical translation initiations

237

and 15 novel viral ORFs. In addition, ORF-RATER identified three putative ORFs that originate

238

from the CUG initiation and extend to the sub-genomic transcripts of S, M and ORF-6a (Table

239

S3). The majority (85%) of the classifier identified ORFs where independently identified in each

240

of the biological replicate (Table S4 and Figure S14). Visual inspection of the ribosome profiling

241

data suggested additional 8 putative novel ORFs, some of which are presented above (Figure 3A,

242

3B, 3G and Table S4). Overall, we identified 23 putative ORFs, on top of the 12 canonical viral

243

ORFs that are currently annotated in NCBI Reference Sequence and 3 additional potential ORFs

244

that stem from the CUG initiation upstream of the leader.

245
246

To confirm the robustness and relevance of these annotations we extended these experiments to

247

human cells. We first examined the infection efficiency of several human cell lines that were

248

used to study SARS-CoV-2 infection; epithelial lung cancer cell lines, Calu3 and A549, and

249

epithelial colorectal adenocarcinoma cell line, Caco2. Infection of Calu3 was most efficient and

250

infection in the presence of trypsin increased infection efficiency by at least 2-fold (Figure S15).

251

We next infected Calu3 with a SARS-CoV-2 that was isolated from an independent source

252

(BavPat1/2020 Ref-SKU: 026V-03883) and the integrity of the virus that we used for infection

253

was confirmed by sequencing (confirming the virus sequence was intact and there were no

254

abundant genomic deletions). Cells were harvested at 7hpi using the same set of ribosome

255

profiling techniques, each one in two biological replicates and in parallel RNA was harvested for

256

RNA-seq. The different Ribo-seq libraries showed the expected distinct profiles in both

257

replicates, confirming the overall quality of these libraries (Figure S16). We next examined the

258

translation of the new viral ORFs we have annotated using PRICE and ORF-RATER classifiers

259

as well as manual curation. Of the 23 novel ORFs we identified as being translated in Vero cells

260

all showed clear evidence of translation also in Calu3 infected cells, 16 were annotated by

261

PRICE and ORF-RATER (three of which are ORFs that were added manually based on the Vero

262

cells data) and ORF-RATER identified again the same three ORFs that originate from the CUG

263

initiation upstream the leader (Figure S17, Table S3 and Table S4). LTM- induced ribosome

264

accumulation at the canonical and predicted initiation sites were highly reproducible between

265

biological replicates as well as between Calu3 and Vero cells, illustrating the robustness of the

266

translation initiation predictions (Figure S18A-C). Furthermore, ribosome-protected footprints

267

displayed a 3-nt periodicity that was in phase with the predicted start site, in both Vero and

268

Calu3 cells providing further evidence for the active translation of the predicted ORFs (Figure

269

S19). We conclude 23 novel ORFs are reproducibly translated from SARS-CoV-2 independently

270

of the host cell and the exact viral origin and additional ORFs may be translated from the CUG

271

initiation located upstream of the TRS-leader.

272
273

Ribosome density also allows accurate quantification of viral protein production. We first

274

quantified the relative expression levels of canonical viral ORFs. Since many of the ORFs we

275

identified overlap canonical ORFs, the quantification was based on the non-overlapping regions.

276

We found that ORF-N is expressed at the highest level in both Vero and Calu3 cells followed by

277

the rest of the viral ORFs with some differences in the relative expression between the two cell

278

types (Figure 4A). To quantify the expression of out-of-frame internal ORFs we computed the

279

contribution of the internal ORF to the frame periodicity signal relative to the expected

280

contribution of the main ORF. For in-frame internal ORF quantification, we subtracted the

281

coverage of the main ORF in the non-overlapping region. We also utilized ORF-RATER, which

282

uses a regression strategy to calculate relative expression of overlapping ORFs, resulting in

283

largely similar estimates of viral ORF translation levels (Figure S20A and S20B). These

284

measurements show that many of the novel ORFs we annotated are expressed in levels that are

285

comparable to the canonical ORFs (Figure 4B, Figure S20C and Table S4). Furthermore, the

286

relative expression of viral proteins seems to be mostly independent of the host cell origin

287

(Figure 4C).

289

Of the novel ORFs we identified 13 are very short (≤ 20 codons) or located in the 5’UTR of the

290

genomic RNA and therefore likely play a regulatory role. Four ORFs are extensions or

291

truncations of canonical ORFs (M, 6, 7a and 10). We examined the properties of the six out-of-

292

frame internal ORFs (iORF)s that are longer than 20aa; one of these is ORF9b and its truncated

293

version (Figure S21A, 97aa and 90aa). ORF9b appears in UniProt annotations and was detected

294

by Bojkova et al. 14 in proteomic measurements, together with our translation measurements this

295

indicates it is a bona fide SARS-CoV-2 protein. In addition we detected an iORF laying at the 5’

296

of ORF-S and its truncated version (Figure 3D, 39 aa and 31 aa), two iORFs within ORF3a

297

(Figure 3C, 41aa and 33 aa) .Mining of recent proteomic measurements of SARS-CoV-2

298

infected cells 14,15 did not detect peptides that originate from the out-of-frame ORFs we

299

annotated, likely due to challenges in detecting trypsin-digested products from short coding

300

regions 24. Indeed, two canonical SARS-CoV-2 proteins, ORF7b (43aa) and ORF-E (75aa) were

301

also not detected by mass-spectrometry 14,15,26,27, and our ribosome profiling data is the first to

302

show these SARS-CoV-2 proteins are indeed expressed.

303
304

Using TMHMM, we found S.iORF1 as well as 3a.iORF1 are predicted to contain a

305

transmembrane domain (Figure S22A and S22B). Additionally, using SignalP we found a

306

predicted signal peptide in 3a.iORF2 (Figure S22C). Analysis of the conservation of these out-

307

of-frame iORFs in SARS-CoV and in related viruses (Sarbecoviruses) revealed 3a.iORF1 is

308

highly conserved in Sarbecoviruses (Table S6). This ORF was also identified by three

309

independent comparative genomic studies that demonstrate this ORF has a significant purifying

310

selection signature, implying it is a functional polypeptide28–30. In combination with our

311

expression measurements, these findings indicate this internal ORF is a novel and likely

312

functional transmembrane protein, conserved throughout sarbecoviruses and as was suggested by

313

Jungreis et al.30 should be named ORF3c.

314

The second iORF overlapping ORF3a and the iORF overlapping S are not conserved in most

315

other sarbecoviruses (Table S6 and 29). The expression of the second iORF overlapping ORF-3a

316

is low (Figure S20) and probably originate from ribosomes that failed to initiate at ORF3a and

317

ORF3c. An extended version of this ORF was pulled-down 31and was shown to elicit a strong

318

antibody response 32 but we find mainly translation of the short version (Figure S21A). The

319

internal S-ORF is situated just downstream of the ORF-S AUG, suggesting ribosomes might

320

initiate translation via leaky scanning. This region in the S-protein shows extremely-rapid

321

evolution30 but in the SARS-CoV-2 isolates that have been sequenced its coding capacity is not

322

impaired. Future work will have to delineate if this ORF, which is highly expressed (Figure 4B

323

and Figure S20), represents a functional protein. Importantly, translated ORFs that do not act as

324

functional polypeptides could still be an important part of the immunological repertoire of the

325

virus as MHC class I bound peptides are generated at higher efficiency from rapidly degraded

326

polypeptides 33.

327
328

Finally, although we identified two internal out-of-frame ORFs within ORF3a, we did not detect

329

translation of SARS-CoV ORF3b homologue, which contains a premature stop codon in SARS-

330

CoV-2 (Figure S21A). In addition, we did not find evidence of translation of ORF14, which

331

appears in some SARS-CoV-2 annotations 23 (Figure S21B).

332

Translation of viral proteins relies on the cellular translation machinery, and coronaviruses, like

333

many other viruses, are known to cause host shutoff 34. In order to quantitatively evaluate if

334

SARS-CoV-2 skews the translation machinery to preferentially translate viral transcripts, we

335

compared the ratio of footprints to mRNAs for virus and host CDSs at 5 hpi and 24 hpi in Vero

336

cells and at 7hpi in Calu3 cells. Since at 24 hpi our ribosome densities were masked by a

337

contaminant signal which do not originate from ribosome protection, for samples from this time

338

point we used the footprints that were mapped to subgenomic RNA junctions (and therefore

339

reflect bona fide transcripts) to estimate the true ribosome densities. In all samples the virus

340

translation efficiencies fall within the low range of most of the host genes (Figure 4D-4F and

341

Figure S23A-C), indicating that viral transcripts are likely not preferentially translated during

342

SARS-CoV-2 infection. Instead, during infection viral transcripts take over the mRNA pool,

343

probably through massive transcription coupled to host induced RNA degradation 35,36.

344

In summary, in this study we delineate the translation landscape of SARS-CoV-2.

345

Comprehensive mapping of the expressed ORFs is a prerequisite for the functional investigation

346

of viral proteins and for deciphering viral-host interactions. An in-depth analysis of the ribosome

347

profiling experiments revealed a highly complex landscape of translation products, including

348

translation of 23 novel viral ORFs and illuminating the relative production of all canonical viral

349

proteins. The new ORFs we have identified may serve as novel accessory proteins or as

350

regulatory units controlling the balanced production of different viral proteins. Studies on the

351

functional significance and antigenic potential of these ORFs will deepen our understanding of

352

SARS-CoV-2 and of coronaviruses in general. Overall, our work reveals the coding capacity of

353

SARS-CoV-2 genome and highlights novel features, providing a rich resource for future

354

functional studies.

The ligated products used for reverse transcription with SSIII (Invitrogen) for first strand cDNA

555

synthesis. The cDNA products were 3’ ligated with a second adaptor using T4 ligase and

556

amplified for 8 cycles in a PCR for final library products of 200-300bp. For Ribo-seq libraries,

557

cells were treated with either 50µM lactimidomycin (LTM) for 30 minutes or 2µg/mL

558

Harringtonine (Harr) for 5 minutes, for translation initiation libraries (LTM and Harr libraries

559

correspondingly), or left untreated for the translation elongation libraries (cycloheximide [CHX]

560

library). All three samples were subsequently treated with 100µg/mL CHX for 1 minute. Cells

561

were then placed on ice, washed twice with PBS containing 100µg/mL CHX, scraped from the

562

T-75 flasks (Vero cells) or 10cm plates (Calu3 cells), pelleted and lysed with lysis buffer (1%

563

triton in 20mM Tris 7.5, 150mM NaCl, 5mM MgCl2, 1mM dithiothreitol supplemented with 10

564

U/ml Turbo DNase and 100µg/ml cycloheximide). After lysis samples stood on ice for 2h and

565

subsequent Ribo-seq library generation was performed as previously described 5. Briefly, cell

566

lysate was treated with RNAseI for 45min at room temperature followed by SUPERse-In

567

quenching. Sample was loaded on sucrose solution (34% sucrose, 20mM Tris 7.5, 150mM NaCl,

568

5mM MgCl2, 1mM dithiothreitol and 100µg/ml cycloheximide) and spun for 1h at 100K RPM

569

using TLA-110 rotor (Beckman) at 4c. Pellet was harvested using TRI reagent and the RNA was

570

collected using chloroform phase separation. For size selection, 15uG of total RNA was loaded

571

into 15% TBE-UREA gel for 65min, and 28-34 footprints were excised using 28 and 34 flanking

572

RNA oligos, followed by RNA extraction and ribo-seq protocol 5

573

Virus genomic sequencing

574

RNA from viruses (culture supernatant after removal of cell debris) was extracted using viral

575

RNA kit (Qiagen). The SMARTer Pico RNA V2 Kit (Clontech) was used for library preparation.

576

Genome sequencing was conducted on the Illumina Miseq platform, in a single read mode 60bp

577

for BetaCoV/Germany/BavPat1/2020 EPI_ISL_406862 and in a paired-end mode 150bp x2 for

578

BavPat1/2020 Ref-SKU: 026V-03883 producing 2,239,263 and 4,332,551 reads

579

correspondingly. Reads were aligned to the viral genome using STAR 2.5.3a aligner. Even

580

coverage along the genome was assessed and the relative abundance junctions (that may reflect

581

genomic deletion) were calculated. For EPI_ISL_406862 passage 4 (that was used for Vero cells

582

infection) the junctions that were found in more than 1% of genomes are listed in Table S2. For

junctions in abundance of more than 1% of the genomes were detected. All genomic sequencing

585

data was deposited.

587

Sequence alignment, normalization and metagene analysis

588

Sequencing reads were aligned as previously described 38. Briefly, linker

589

(CTGTAGGCACCATCAAT) and poly-A sequences were removed and the remaining reads

590

from were aligned to the Chlorocebus sabaeus genome (ENSEMBL release 99) and to the

591

SARS-Cov-2 genomes [Genebank NC_045512.2 with 3 changes to match the used strain

592

(BetaCoV/Germany/BavPat1/2020 EPI_ISL_406862), 241:C−>T, 3037:C−>T, 23403:A−>G].

593

(infection of Vero cells) or to the Hg19 and NC_045512.2 with the same sequence changes

594

(infection of Calu3). Alignment was performed using Bowtie v1.1.2 39 with maximum two

595

mismatches per read. Reads that were not aligned to the genome were aligned to the

596

transcriptome of Chlorocebus sabaeus (ENSEMBL) and to SARS-CoV-2 junctions that were

597

recently annotated 18. The aligned position on the genome was determined as the 5’ position of

598

RNA-seq reads, and for Ribo-seq reads the p-site of the ribosome was calculated according to

599

reads length using the off-set from the 5’ end of the reads that was calculated from canonical

600

cellular ORFs. The offsets used are +12 for reads that were 28-29 bp and +13 for reads that were

601

30-33 bp. Reads that were in different length were discarded. In all figures presenting ribosome

602

densities data all footprint lengths (28-33bp) are presented.

603

Novel junctions were mapped using STAR 2.5.3a aligner 40, with running flags as suggested at

604

Kim et. al., to overcome filtering of non-canonical junctions. Reads aligned to multiple locations

605

were discarded. Junctions with 5’ break sites mapped to genomic location 55-85 were assigned

606

as leader-dependent junctions. Matching of leader junctions to ORFs, and categorization of

607

junctions as canonical or non-canonical, was adapted from Kim et. al. 18 Supplementary table 3,

608

or was assigned manually for strong novel junctions that appear only in our data.

609

For the metagene analysis only genes with more than 50 reads were used. For each gene

610

normalization was done to its maximum signal and each position was normalized to the number

611

of genes contributing to the position. In the virus 24hr samples, normalization for each gene was

612

done to its maximum signal within the presented region.

613

For comparing transcript expression level, mRNA and footprint counts from bowtie alignment

614

were normalized to units of RPKM in order to normalize for gene length and for sequencing

615

depth, based on the total number reads for both the host and the virus. The deconvolution of

616

RPKM for RNAs was done by subtracting the RPKM of a gene from the RPKM of the gene

617

located just upstream of it in the genome. The junction counts were based on STAR alignment

618

number of uniquely mapped reads crossing the junction.

619

The estimation of the viral footprint densities from the 24 hpi samples was performed by

620

calculating the ratio of the RPKM of ORF1a to the total number of leader canonical junctions at

621

5hpi. This ratio was used as a factor to calculate a proxy for the “true’ viral footprint densities

622

from the number of footprints that were mapped to leader canonical junctions at 24hpi.

623

To quantify the translation levels of novel viral ORFs at 5hpi and 7hpi, many of which are

624

overlapping, three types of calculations were used based on ORF type. For ORFs that have a

625

unique region, with no overlap to any other ORF, bowtie aligned read density was calculated in

626

that region. For out-of-frame internal ORFs, the read density of the internal ORF region was

627

calculated by estimating the expected 3-bp periodicity distribution of footprints based on non-

628

overlapping translated regions in the main ORF. Using linear regression, we calculated the

629

relative contribution of the frames of the main and of the internal ORF to the reads covering the

630

region of the internal ORF. The relative contribution of the internal ORF was then multiplied by

631

the read density in that region to obtain the estimated translation level of the internal out-of-

632

frame ORF. For in-frame internal ORFs the read density of the main overlapping ORF is

633

calculated from a non-overlapping region and then subtracted from the read density in the

634

overlapping internal ORF region to get an estimate of translation levels of the internal ORF. In

635

cases where the unique region used to calculate read density contained the start-codon of the

636

ORF, the first 20% of the codons in the region were excluded from the calculation to avoid bias

637

from initiation peaks, unless the region was very short and trimming it would harm the ability to

638

estimate coverage (ORF 8 and extended ORF M). The exact regions that were used for

639

calculation can be found in Table S5. Finally, read density was normalized to the length of the

640

region used for calculation and to the sum of length normalized reads in each sample to get TPM

641

values. P-values for the relative contribution levels of out-of-frame ORFs were calculated from

642

both replicates using a mixed-effects linear model using the 3-base periodicity distribution as the

643

fixed effect and the replicates as random effect. In parallel, ORF-RATER was used to quantify

644

the translation levels of the viral ORFs (using regression), giving largely similar values

645

(Spearmen’s R = 0.92 and R = 0.87 in VeroE6 and Calu3, respectively).

646
647
648

Prediction of translation initiation sites and transmembrane domains

649

Translation initiation sites were predicted using PRICE 24 and ORF-RATER 25. To estimate the

650

codons generating the sequencing reads with maximum likelihood, PRICE requires a predefined

651

set of annotated coding sequences from the same experiment. Thus, it does not perform well on

652

reference sequences with a small number of annotated ORFs such as SARS-CoV-2. Since our

653

experiment generated ribosome footprints from both SARS-CoV-2 and host mRNAs, which

654

were exposed to the exact same conditions in the protocol, we used annotated CDSs from the

655

host cells to evaluate the parameters of the experiment. For libraries of infected Vero cells

656

sequencing reads were aligned using Bowtie to a fasta file containing chromosome 20 of

657

Chlorocebus sabaeus (1240 annotated start codons, downloaded from ensembl:

658

ftp://ftp.ensembl.org/pub/release99/fasta/chlorocebus_sabaeus/dna/) and the genomic sequence

659

of SARS-CoV-2 (Refseq NC_045512.2). A gtf file with the annotations of Chlorocebus sabaeus

660

and SARS-CoV-2 genomes was constructed and provided as the annotations file when running

661

PRICE. For technical reasons, the annotation of the first coding sequence (CDS) of the two

662

CDSs in the “ORF1ab” gene was deleted since having two CDSs encoded from a single gene

663

was not permitted by PRICE. For libraries of infected Calu3 cells sequencing reads were mapped

664

to a fasta file containing chromosome 1 of hg19 (2843 annotated start codons) and the genomic

665

sequence of SARS-CoV-2 (Refseq NC_045512.2). A gtf file with the annotations of hg19 and

666

SARS-CoV-2 genomes was constructed and provided as the annotations file when running

667

PRICE. For the data that was generated from infected Vero cells at 5hpi training and ORF

668

prediction by PRICE were done once using the CHX data from both replicates, and again using

669

all Ribo-seq libraries from both replicates, and the resulting predictions were combined. To test

670

reproducibility, the same predictions were performed on each replicate separately. For the data

671

that was generated from infected Calu3 cells at 7hpi training and ORF prediction by PRICE were

672

done using all Ribo-seq libraries from both replicates The predictions were further filtered to

673

include only ORFs with at least 100 reads at the initiation site in the LTM samples of at least one

674

replicate. ORFs were then defined by extending each initiating codon to the next in-frame stop

675

codon.

676

ORF-RATER was used with the default values besides allowing all start codons with at most one

677

mismatch to ATG. For each cell type, two runs of ORF-RATER were used. One in which ORF-

678

RATER was trained on cellular annotations (chr 20 for the Vero cells, and chr 1 for the Calu

679

cells) and SARS-CoV-2 canonical ORFs (similar to the procedure that was used for running

680

PRICE). In the second run only SARS-CoV-2 canonical ORFs were used for training. In both

681

cases ORF1b and ORF10 were omitted from the training set. BAM files from STAR alignment

682

were used as input. The CHX data from both replicates was used in the first prune step to omit

683

low coverage ORFs. The calculations of the P-site offsets, and the regression were performed for

684

each Ribo-Seq library separately. The final score was calculated based on all three types of

685

libraries. Score of 0.5 was used as cut-off for the final predictions these were further manually

686

curated. Additional ORFs that were not recognized by the trained models (likely due to

687

differences in the features of viral genome compared to cellular genomes) but presented

688

reproducible translation profile in the two cell lines were added manually to the final ORF list

689

(Table S4). ORFs were manually identified as such if they had reproducible initiation peaks in

690

the CHX libraries that were enhanced in the LTM and Harr libraries, and exhibited increased

691

CHX signal in the correct reading-frame along the coding region.

692

Mapping reads to CUG initiation upstream the TRS-leader

693

Reads from ribosome profiling libraries were aligned using bowtie to a single reference that

694

contained the transcripts and the genome allowing no mismatches or gaps. Reads with p-site

695

mapped to position 59 of the viral genome were collected and divided to four groups according

696

to the nucleotide in position +17 of the read (position 76 of the genome). The first group contains

697

reads that are short (28 nucleotides) and do not have any nucleotide at position +17. The other

698

three groups, referred to as T, A and G, correspond to combinations of genomic and subgenomic

699

RNAs based on their sequence, as shown in figure S14. Group T is attributed to the genome or to

700

ORF E and ORF M subgenomic RNAs, group A to the subgenomic RNAs of ORF S, ORF7a,

701

ORF8 and ORF N, and group G to the sub-genomic RNA of ORF 6. Reads mapped uniquely to

702

the subgenomic RNA of ORF3a were excluded from calculation, and the number of reads in

703

each group was summed. Group T, containing genomic reads, was further divided based on the

704

nucleotide at position +18, where reads with A at that position can originate from the

705

subgenomic RNA of ORF M and reads with T at that position can originate from the genome or

706

from the subgenomic RNA of ORF E. Final division of the genomic group was done based on

707

position +19 where T corresponds to genomic reads and A corresponds to ORF E subgenomic

708

reads. RNA values as calculated from junction densities (described above) were summed for the

709

subgenomic and genomic RNAs in each group. The analysis was performed for each ribosome

710

profiling library separately.

711

Mining of proteomics data

712

Data downloaded from Bojkova et al.14 was searched using Byonic search engine using 10ppm

713

tolerance for MS1 and 20ppm tolerance for MS2, against the concatenated database containing

714

our 26 novels ORFs as well as the human proteome DB (SwissProt Nov2019), and the SARS-

715

CoV-2 proteome. Modifications allowed were fixed carbamidomethylation on C, fixed TMT6 on

716

K and peptide N-terminus, variable K8 and R10 SILAC labeling, variable M oxidation and

717

Variable NQ deamidation. Data downloaded from Davidson et al.15 was searched using Byonic

718

search engine using 10ppm tolerance for MS1 and 0.6Da tolerance for MS2, against the

719

concatenated database containing our 26 novel ORFs as well as the human proteome DB

720

(SwissProt Nov2019), and the SARS-CoV-2 proteome. Modifications allowed were fixed

721

carbamidomethylation on C, variable N-terminal protein acetylation, M oxidation and NQ

722

deamidation.

723

Immunofluorescence

724

Cells were plated on ibidi slides, fixed in 3% paraformaldehyde for 20 minutes, permeabilized

725

with 0.5% Triton X-100 in PBS for 2 minutes, and then blocked with 2% FBS in PBS for 30

726

minutes. Immunostaining was performed with rabbit anti-SARS-CoV-2 serum. Cells were

727

washed and labeled with anti-rabbit FITC antibody and with DAPI (4=,6-diamidino-2-

728

phenylindole). Imaging was performed on a Zeiss AxioObserver Z1 wide-field microscope using

729

a X40 objective and Axiocam 506 mono camera.
