ABSTRACT

27

Positive-strand RNA viruses have been the etiological agents in several major disease

28

outbreaks over the last few decades. Examples of that are flaviviruses, such as dengue

29

virus and Zika virus that cause millions of yearly infections and spread around the

30

globe, and coronaviruses, such as SARS-CoV-2, which is the cause of the current

31

pandemic. The severity of outbreaks caused by these viruses stresses the importance

32

of virology research in determining mechanisms to limit virus spread and to curb

33

disease severity. Such studies require molecular tools to decipher virus-host

34

interactions and to develop effective interventions. Here, we describe the generation

35

and characterization of a reporter system to visualize dengue virus and SARS-CoV-2

36

replication in live cells. The system is based on viral protease activity causing

37

cleavage and nuclear translocation of an engineered fluorescent protein that is

38

expressed in the infected cells. We show the suitability of the system for live cell

39

imaging and visualization of single infected cells as well as for screening and testing

40

of antiviral compounds. Given the modular building blocks, the system is easy to

41

manipulate and can be adapted to any virus encoding a protease, thus offering a high

42

degree of flexibility.

43

IMPORTANCE

44

Reporter systems are useful tools for fast and quantitative visualization of viral

45

replication and spread within a host cell population. Here we describe a reporter

46

system that takes advantage of virus-encoded proteases that are expressed in infected

47

cells to cleave an ER-anchored fluorescent protein fused to a nuclear localization

48

sequence. Upon cleavage, the fluorescent protein translocates to the nucleus, allowing

49

for rapid detection of the infected cells. Using this system, we demonstrate reliable

50

reporting activity for two major human pathogens from the Flaviviridae and the

51

Coronaviridae families: dengue virus and SARS-CoV-2. We apply this reporter

52

system to live cell imaging and use it for proof-of-concept to validate antiviral activity

53

of a nucleoside analogue. This reporter system is not only an invaluable tool for the

54

characterization of viral replication, but also for the discovery and development of

55

antivirals that are urgently needed to halt the spread of these viruses.

56

INTRODUCTION

57

Positive sense single stranded RNA viruses constitute a major fraction of endemic and

58

emerging human viruses (1). Among the positive-strand RNA viruses, flaviviruses

59

such as dengue virus (DENV) and Zika virus (ZIKV) are some of the most prevalent

60

arboviral pathogens and are considered a major public health problem (2, 3).

61

Currently, there are no universal vaccines or specific antiviral drug approved for the

62

prevention or treatment of infections with these viruses (4). Members of the

63

Coronaviridae family also have a positive-strand RNA genome and have caused

64

major outbreaks in the last two decades (5, 6). Currently, the world is facing the

65

pandemic outbreak of SARS-CoV-2, the causative agent of coronavirus disease 2019

66

(COVID-19) (7, 8). As of August 2020, over 19 million confirmed cases and more

67

than 700,000 confirmed deaths have been reported in 216 countries (9). Despite

68

immense efforts by research teams around the world, there is still a dire need for

69

effective and widely available treatment options and a prophylactic vaccine.

70

Once released into the cell, the full genome of flaviviruses and the large open reading

71

frame (ORF1ab) of coronaviruses are translated as polyproteins. Signal peptides and

72

internal transmembrane regions direct polyprotein synthesis to the endoplasmic

73

reticulum (ER) membrane where co-translational cleavage generates the mature viral

bioRxiv preprint doi: https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.08.31.276683; this version posted September 1, 2020. The copyright holder for this

74

proteins (10, 11). The flaviviral protease NS2B/3, together with host proteases,

75

cleaves the flavivirus polyprotein into three structural and seven non-structural

76

proteins (12, 13). In the case of coronaviruses, ORF1ab is expressed as two

77

polyproteins, which are cleaved into sixteen non-structural proteins (nsp) by the viral

78

papain-like protease (PLpro) residing in nsp3 and the 3C-like protease (3CLpro) of nsp5

79

(14–17). The replication of viral RNA of both virus groups was shown to occur on ER

80

derived membranes, in specialized virus-induced membrane compartments termed

81

replication organelles (10, 11, 18–20).

82

Reporter systems for detection of virus infection are an invaluable tool for the

83

characterization and quantification of virus infection kinetics, for the characterization

84

of virus-host cell interactions and for the identification of antiviral compounds. One

85

approach is the insertion of tags into the viral genome that, upon replication and

86

translation, allow for visualization of the infected cells. However, this approach

87

requires functional molecular clones of a given genome, which are not always

88

available. In addition, insertion of a tag frequently causes attenuation of viral

89

replication competency and therefore, the search for adequate insertion sites is time-

90

consuming or might fail.

91

An alternative approach is the use of engineered fluorescent reporter proteins stably

92

expressed in cells and altering their subcellular distribution upon viral infection (21–

93

23). Building on this idea, here we established a reporter system based on an ER-

94

anchored green fluorescent protein (GFP) that upon cleavage by a viral protease is

95

released from the ER and translocated into the nucleus. Using this system, we

96

demonstrate the reliable reporting activity of DENV and SARS-CoV-2 infected cells.

97

Moreover, we apply this reporter cell system to live cell imaging and assessment of an

98

antiviral compound.

MATERIALS AND METHODS

100

Cell lines and virus strains. HEK-293T, A549 and VeroE6 cells were purchased

101

from ATCC; Huh7 cells (24) were obtained from Heinz Schaller (Center for

102

Molecular Biology, Heidelberg). Generation of the cell lines Huh7-Lunet and the

103

derivative Huh7-Lunet-T7, stably expressing the RNA polymerase of bacteriophage

104

T7, have been previously described (25, 26). All cells were cultured at 37°C and 5%

105

CO2 in Dulbecco’s modified Eagle medium (DMEM, Life Technologies) containing

106

10% fetal bovine serum, 100 U/mL penicillin, 100 µg/mL streptomycin and 1% non-

107

essential amino acids (complete medium). Huh7-Lunet-T7 cells were cultured in

108

complete medium, supplemented with 5 µg/mL zeocin. A549-ACE2 were generated

109

by transduction of A549 with lentiviruses encoding for the human Angiotensin-

110

converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) gene as previously described (41).

111

Wild-type (WT) DENV-2 was produced from an infectious molecular clone based on

112

strain 16681 as described elsewhere (27). The DENV reporter virus genome encoding

113

the Turbo far red fluorescent protein FP635 (DENV-faR) has been previously

114

described (28). SARS-CoV-2 (strain BavPat1) was kindly provided by Prof. Christian

115

Drosten (Charité Berlin, Germany) through the European Virology Archive. Except

116

for DENV-faR that was generated by electroporation of BHK-21 cells as previously

117

described (28), all virus stocks were generated by infection of VeroE6 cells.

118

Supernatants were harvested, filtered, and virus concentration was determined by

119

plaque assay. For infection experiments, cells were inoculated as specified in the

120

results section for 1 h at 37°C. Fresh complete medium was then added, and cells

121

were incubated for the indicated time spans.

Generation of the reporter construct. A synthetic DNA construct containing the

126

sequence encoding the reporter protein was generated by Integrated DNA

127

technologies (Coralville, IA, USA). The reporter sequence was inserted into the

128

lentiviral

129

Oligonucleotides encoding the protease cleavage sites were designed to allow

130

insertion into the vector via MluI and BamHI restriction sites. The primer pairs (Table

131

2) spanning a given protease cleavage site were heated to 95°C and allowed to anneal

132

by decreasing the temperature in 5°C increments every 2 min. The resulting double-

133

stranded DNA product was inserted via MluI and BamHI into pWPI-RC and ligation

134

products were amplified in E. coli (strain DH5. Integrity of amplified plasmids was

135

confirmed by restriction pattern analysis and sequence analysis of the insert region,

136

respectively. The complete nucleotide and amino acid sequences of the reporter

137

construct are available on request. The expression of the reporter construct was under

138

the control of the eukaryotic translation elongation factor 1-alpha promoter.

Lentiviral transduction and generation of reporter cell lines. Cells stably

141

expressing the protease reporter constructs were generated by lentiviral transduction.

142

Subconfluent HEK-293T cells were transfected with the pWPI vector encoding the

143

reporter construct together with packaging plasmids pCMV-Gag-Pol and pMD2-

144

VSV-G (kind gifts from D. Trono, EPFL, Lausanne). After 2 days, the supernatant of

145

transfected cells was harvested, filtered, and stored at -80°C. Lentiviruses were

146

titrated by SYBR green I-based real-time PCR-enhanced reverse transcriptase (SG-

147

PERT) assay (29, 30) using the Takyon SYBR green kit (Eurogentec). The titer was

148

determined by comparison with a standard curve of known RNA concentrations.

149

Lentiviral transduction was performed by addition of the filtered supernatant to Huh7,

150

Huh7-Lunet-T7 or A549-ACE2 cells (multiplicity of infection (MOI) = 5) in presence

151

of 4 µg/mL of polybrene. For the generation of stable cell lines expressing the

152

reporter constructs, cells were cultured in medium containing 1 µg/mL puromycin.

153

Cells stably expressing the SARS-CoV-2 optimized reporter construct were FACS-

154

sorted to obtain single cell clones with homogenous expression levels of the

155

fluorescent reporter.

156

Indirect immunofluorescence (IF). Cells were seeded on glass cover slips and

fixed with paraformaldehyde (PFA, 4% in PBS) at room temperature (RT). PFA was

159

removed, cells were washed once with PBS and the cover slips were covered with

PBS containing Triton X-100 (0.2%) to permeabilize the cells. Cells on cover slips

161

were blocked with skimmed milk (2%) in PBS containing Tween20 (PBS-T (0.02%))

162

for 1 h. After blocking, the cover slips were placed on 30 µL of primary antibody,

diluted in the blocking buffer, with the cell side facing the drop. Cells were incubated

164

for 1.5 h at RT and washed thrice with PBS-T (0.02%). The cover slips were then

169

Western blot. Cells were washed once with PBS and lysed in western blot lysis

170

buffer (1% Triton X-100). After sonification and denaturation at 95°C, protein

171

concentration was measured by Bradford assay. Cell lysates were mixed with

172

Bradford reagent (1:5; Bio-Rad) and absorbance was measured at 595 nm. For each

173

sample, 10 µg of total lysate was resolved by electrophoresis into a 10% or 15%

174

sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel for NS3 or GFP, respectively. Proteins

175

were transferred to a polyvinylidene fluoride membrane overnight at 4°C. Membranes

176

were blocked in skimmed milk (5%) in PBS-T (0.2%) for 1 h at RT. After washing

177

thrice with PBS-T (0.2%) for 15 min, membranes were incubated with primary

178

antibody for 1 h at RT. The membranes were washed thrice and HRP-conjugated

179

secondary antibody was added. After incubation for 1 h at RT, the membrane was

180

washed thrice, and the bound antibodies were detected using enhanced

181

chemiluminescence solution (Perkin Elmer, Waltham, MA, USA). Images were

187

using TransIT-LT1 (Mirus Bio) transfection reagent according to the manufacturer’s

188

instructions. Four hours post transfection (hpt) the transfection medium was

191

live cell imaging, A549-ACE2 or a selected clone of A549-ACE2 stably expressing

192

the fluorescent reporter (A549-ACE2-RC), were seeded on 35 mm dishes (Ibidi) with

SARS-CoV-2 (MOI = 10) and 2 hpi the medium was exchanged for imaging medium.

195

Lid was moved to the locked position and silicon was used to seal the dish in order to

196

prevent evaporation. Images were collected with a 20x lambda air objective on a

Nikon Eclipse Ti widefield microscope. Multiple observation fields were imaged for 8

198

h or 18 h at an interval of 10 min for transfection or infection, respectively.

199

Compound screening assay. A549-ACE2 cell clones were seeded in duplicates for

200

each condition. On the next day, the cells were treated with a serial dilution of 1:3,

201

starting at 1.1 µM Remdesivir (Hoelzel-biotech, Germany) or with the solvent

202

dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) serving as a control. After 30 min, cells were infected

203

with SARS-CoV-2 (MOI = 5) in the presence of the compound and 16 h later, cells

204

were fixed and stained for N protein by IF. Images were acquired with a Perkin Elmer

205

spinning disk confocal microscope. Signal intensity of N protein staining and nuclear

206

GFP signal was quantified on a single cell level by a semi-automated image analysis

workflow (31). Cells were considered as positive for infection in the reporter cell line

208

when the nuclear GFP signal intensity was greater than 7,000 arbitrary fluorescence

units. Inhibition was quantified by normalizing the values to those obtained with cells

RESULTS

218

Design and characterization of DENV reporter constructs.

219

In order to generate a reporter system that can specifically indicate virus infection, we

220

designed a construct expressing a GFP fusion protein that could selectively be cleaved

221

by viral proteases. The reporter construct was engineered for viruses that produce ER

222

tethered polyproteins that are processed by viral proteases in close proximity to ER

223

membranes. The transmembrane (TM) domain of the ER-resident protein sec61β was

used to target the reporter protein to ER membranes (Figure 1). This ER anchor was

225

connected to a GFP moiety containing the nuclear localization signal (NLS) sequence

226

from simian virus 40 large T-Antigen via a variable linker. The linker region was

227

flanked by restriction enzyme recognition sites allowing the easy insertion and

228

screening of different protease cleavage sequences (Figure 1A). Protease cleavage of

229

the linker would result in GFP translocation from the cytosolic ER to the nucleus,

230

which can be easily detected and quantified by light microscopy.

231

The DENV polyprotein is cleaved into the individual viral proteins by either the host

232

signal peptidase of the viral NS2B/3 serine protease (12, 13). The ER-resident NS2B

233

protein acts as a co-factor of NS3 protease and anchors it to ER membranes (35, 36).

234

To determine an optimal system for reporting DENV infection, several previously

235

described NS2B/3 specific cleavage sequences were inserted into the reporter

236

construct (Table 3).

238

Reporting activity of the cells expressing each of the constructs was first tested by

239

assessing the subcellular GFP localization by IF. Reporter cell lines were generated by

240

lentiviral transduction of Huh7 cells at an MOI of 5 to ensure maximal transduction

241

efficiency. Subsequently, the cell pools expressing an individual construct were

242

infected with DENV for 48 h (MOI = 5) to observe GFP localization in infected

243

versus non-infected cells. To ensure specificity of GFP translocation, cells were fixed

244

and stained for DENV NS3 protein.

245

In DENV-infected cells, NS3 was observed in the perinuclear region as previously

246

described (10, 18, 39). While the GFP signal from the reporter constructs 1, 2, 3 and 7

247

showed an ER-like pattern in mock infected cells, nuclear signal was observed in cells

248

expressing constructs 4, 5, 6 and 8 already in the absence of DENV (Figures 2A and

249

2B). In infected cells expressing the reporter construct 1, a noticeable increase of

250

nuclear GFP signal was found (Figure 2C). Increased nuclear GFP localization, upon

251

DENV infection, was also observed in reporter cell lines expressing constructs 3, 4, 5,

252

7, and 8. No clear differences of GFP localizations were seen for constructs 2 and 6

253

following virus infection. For construct 1, all cells with nuclear GFP signal were also

254

positive for NS3 staining and an additional ~6% of cells were positive for NS3

255

staining alone (Figures 2C and 2D). The other constructs showed a higher percentage

256

of cells only positive for NS3 staining and in cells expressing constructs 2, 6 and 7,

257

nuclear GFP signal was observed in the absence of NS3 staining (Figure 2C).

258

To investigate cleavage of the various reporter proteins in DENV infected cells, we

259

used western blot analysis of cell lysates prepared 48 h post infection (Figure 2E).

260

Based on the construct design, the cleaved GFP-NLS fusion protein was predicted to

261

have a molecular weight of ~34 kDa. In the mock infected cell lines, we observed a

262

GFP protein with the expected molecular weight and additional bands that were also

263

found in cells transfected with empty plasmid. Upon DENV infection, additional ~30

264

kDa GFP-positive bands were detectable in cell lysates containing reporter constructs

265

1, 4, 5, 7 and to a lesser extent in cell lysates with constructs 3 and 8, which is

266

consistent with the predicted cleavage product size. Notably, construct 1 showed

267

higher levels of specific cleaved product compared to the other cell lines.

268

To summarize, DENV infected cells expressing reporter construct 1, containing the

269

NS2B/3 cleavage site from the capsid region, showed the highest level of the correct

270

cleavage product in western blot analysis as well as robust and specific nuclear

271

translocation of GFP signal by fluorescence microscopy. Therefore, reporter construct

272

1 was chosen for generation of stable cell lines for further characterization. These

273

Huh7-derived cell lines were designated reporter construct (RC) cell lines Huh7-RC

274

and Lunet-T7-RC.

275

Time-course experiments confirm early and reliable identification of DENV

276

NS2B/3 positive cells.

277

Next, we analyzed the kinetics of GFP translocation in the reporter cell line Huh7-RC.

278

Cells were infected with either the WT DENV or with a DENV reporter expressing a

279

far red fluorescent protein (DENV-faR; MOI = 5) (28). Cells were fixed at 24 h, 48 h

280

or 72 h post infection and subsequently analyzed by wide-field fluorescence

281

microscopy (Figure 3A).

282

Mock infected reporter cells exhibited the predicted ER-like localization of the GFP

283

signal. In contrast, reporter cells infected with WT virus showed nuclear GFP

284

localization as early as 24 h after infection and the proportion of nuclear signal

285

increased at later time points (Figure 3A). Reporter cells infected with DENV-faR

286

showed a similar trend, although a lower number of reporting cells was observed at 24

287

h and 48 h post infection in comparison to WT infected reporter cells (Figure 3A),

288

consistent with lower replication capacity of the reporter virus (28). Cells infected

289

with DENV-faR showed an increase of red fluorescence in a time-dependent manner

290

providing evidence for viral replication and spread. Importantly, ~83% to 100% of

291

cells exhibiting red fluorescence also showed nuclear translocation of GFP at 48 h or

292

72 h post infection, respectively (Figure 3A). Additionally, only 2-3% of cells were

293

positive for nuclear GFP in absence of reporter virus signal. These results indicate that

294

the reporter cell line successfully detected DENV infected cells and that the infected

295

cells can be reliably identified as early as 24 h post infection. Furthermore, this

296

experiment demonstrated the suitability of the reporter construct to define the

297

percentage of DENV infected cells without the need for intracellular staining.

298

Live cell imaging of cells expressing the DENV polyprotein.

299

Recently, a plasmid-based expression system for induction of DENV replication

300

organelles in transfected cells has been described (40). This system, designated

301

"plasmid-induced replication organelle - dengue (pIRO-D), encodes the viral

302

polyprotein that is translated from an RNA generated in the cytoplasm by a stably

303

expressed T7 RNA polymerase. In this way, the pIRO-D system allows the analysis of

bioRxiv preprint doi: https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.08.31.276683; this version posted September 1, 2020. The copyright holder for this

304

viral proteins in cells, independent of viral replication. However, since no fluorescent

305

protein coding sequence is incorporated into the construct, expression of the DENV

306

polyprotein cannot be followed by live cell imaging.

307

To overcome this limitation, we determined whether our DENV reporter cell line

308

could be combined with the pIRO-D system to analyze the expression of the viral

309

polyprotein in real-time. Huh7-Lunet cells stably expressing the T7 RNA polymerase

310

and the reporter construct (Lunet-T7-RC) were seeded in dishes with glass bottoms

311

and on the next day transfected with the pIRO-D construct (Figure 3B). The growth

312

medium was changed to imaging medium at 4 h after transfection and the dishes

313

transferred to a live cell imaging microscope. The GFP signal was recorded every 10

314

min for 8 h (final time point at 12 h post transfection). Representative images of mock

315

transfected and pIRO-D-transfected cells at 2 h increments are shown in Figure 3C; a

316

video spanning an 8 h observation period of transfected cells is shown in

317

supplementary movie S1.

318

No nuclear translocation of the GFP reporter was detected in mock transfected Lunet-

319

T7-RC cells (Figure 3C, upper row). In pIRO-D-transfected cells, nuclear localization

320

was already detected in a few cells as early as 4 h post transfection, suggesting a

321

robust expression of the viral polyprotein. The number of cells with nuclear GFP

322

signal as well as the intensity of the signal increased over time.

Development of a reporter system for identification of SARS-CoV-2 infected

325

The ability to rapidly detect virus infection in cell culture on a large scale is a valuable

326

tool for studies of virus-host interactions, but also for identification and evaluation of

327

antiviral drugs. The recent outbreak of SARS-CoV-2 has created a dire need for such

328

tools to characterize virus infection and develop therapeutics. Therefore, we adapted

329

and optimized the reporter system to sense SARS-CoV-2 infection. The first two open

330

reading frames of coronaviruses are expressed as polyproteins ORF1a/b, which are

331

cleaved into the individual proteins by viral proteases PLpro and 3CLpro (14–16). The

332

sequence of the SARS-CoV-1 Frankfurt isolate was analyzed to determine the

333

protease cleavage sites between individual nsps, and the deduced sequences were

334

inserted into the linker region of our reporter construct (Table 4). The generation of

335

constructs 2, 11 and 13 failed and they were not further pursued.

342

post infection. Cytosolic GFP localization was observed in all mock infected cells

343

expressing the reporter constructs except for construct 3, where nuclear signal was

344

evident (Figure 4A and 4B). No clear differences in GFP localization between mock

345

and virus infected cells were observed for reporter constructs 1, 5 and 7 (Figure 4C),

346

while all the others showed an increase in nuclear GFP signal upon infection

347

(Figure 4C and 4D). Among the different constructs, the reporter construct 14 was the

348

most sensitive, showing the highest number of cells double positive for dsRNA and

349

nuclear GFP together with the lowest number of cells single positive for dsRNA

350

staining (Figure 4D) and therefore was selected for further investigation.

351

Live cell imaging of SARS-CoV-2 infection.

352

To determine the kinetics of the reporting activity we investigated SARS-CoV-2

353

infection in reporter cells by live cell imaging. Since transiently transduced cells

354

expressing the SARS-CoV-2 reporter construct showed highly heterogenous GFP

355

signal intensity as well as the formation of large fluorescent aggregates (Figures 4A

356

and 4C), we generated single cell clones by FACS sorting for cells with low

357

expression. Among the twenty cell clones generated, clone C2 was selected based

358

both on SARS-CoV-2 infection susceptibility and reporting activity (data not shown).

359

The A549-ACE2 cells were transiently transduced with lentivirus encoding for the

360

SARS-CoV-2 reporter construct 14 and seeded on glass bottom plates. After 24 h,

361

cells were infected with SARS-CoV-2 (Figure 5A). Previous studies have determined

362

that a complete virus replication cycle can occur within 6 h after infection but that

363

virus replication and assembly continues to increase up to 24 h in A549-ACE2 cells

364

(41). Therefore, live cell imaging was started at 2 h post infection and images were

365

acquired every 10 min for 18 h (final time point 20 h post infection) (supplemental

Movie S2). Representative images of mock and SARS-CoV-2 infected cells are

367

shown in Figure 5B.

368

Mock infected cells exhibited an ER-like GFP signal throughout the observed time

369

frame. In infected cells, a time-dependent increase in the numbers of cells showing

370

nuclear GFP signal was observed with the earliest translocation event starting at 5.5 h

371

post infection (supplementary Movie S2). These data demonstrate the suitability of

372

our reporter system for live cell imaging analysis of SARS-CoV-2 infection.

373

Application of the SARS-CoV-2 reporter for drug screening.

374

The need for effective treatment for COVID-19 prompted us to investigate the

375

suitability of the reporter cell line for drug screening. A proof-of-concept experiment

376

was performed by using the nucleoside analogue Remdesivir, which is currently the

377

only FDA-approved drug for treatment of SARS-CoV-2 infection. Both the A549-

378

ACE2 C2 reporter clone and the parental A549-ACE2 cells without reporter construct

379

expression were incubated with serial dilutions of Remdesivir for 30 min and infected

380

with SARS-CoV-2 (MOI = 5). The compound remained present throughout the

381

duration of the experiment. Cells were fixed at 16 h post infection and GFP

382

translocation was evaluated using confocal microscopy.

383

Treatment with 1.1 µM Remdesivir lead to the loss of viral N protein fluorescence

384

signal in both cell lines confirming the previously described antiviral activity (42, 43)

385

(Figure 5C). Nuclear GFP signal was observed in DMSO treated reporter cells

386

infected with SARS-CoV-2 confirming the reporting activity of the cell line. The

387

percentage of cells displaying nuclear GFP signal and cytosolic N protein staining in

388

the different Remdesivir dilutions was quantified by a semi-automated image analysis

389

workflow (31) (Figure 5D). The IC50 calculated for the N protein staining was 40 nM

390

(R2 = 0.987, 95% CI = 27.05 – 55.89 nM), in line with IC50 values found in our in-

391

house assay (H. Kim and R. Bartenschlager, unpublished). Quantification with the

392

reporter signal showed an IC50 of 14 nM (R2 = 0.997, 95% CI = 15.21 – 17.97 nM).

393

This decrease in IC50 value is likely due to reduced sensitivity of the reporter

394

construct that relies on 3CLpro activity and the higher background in the read-out in

395

comparison to IF staining of the highly abundant N protein. Nevertheless, the two IC50

396

values differ by only a factor of ~3 and therefore are quite comparable. Thus, our

397

reporter system can be reliably used in primary screens to screen e.g. large compound

398

libraries.

399

DISCUSSION

400

This study describes the generation and characterization of a fluorescence-based

401

reporter system for detection of DENV and SARS-CoV-2 infection. The reporter

402

construct contains three functional elements: a fluorescent protein fused to an NLS,

403

the TM domain of sec61β for ER membrane anchoring and an exchangeable protease

404

cleavage site cassette located within the linker region that connects the fluorescent

405

protein and the ER anchor. This design allows easy adaptation of the reporter system

406

to other viruses that encode for specific viral proteases, especially for other positive-

407

stranded RNA viruses replicating in the cytoplasm. The high selectivity and

408

specificity of the selected constructs, as shown by IF, western blot and live cell

409

imaging, render this tool suitable for applications that require single cell analysis,

410

such as live cell imaging and correlative light-electron microscopy (CLEM)

411

approaches. Moreover, combining our reporter cell lines with image analysis pipelines

412

that quantify nuclear translocation events allows for rapid and robust assessment of

413

antiviral efficacy of compounds or other antiviral interventions, including high-

414

throughput screening of large compound libraries.

415

Among the different cleavage sites tested for DENV, the reporter construct 1,

416

composed of the cleavage site between capsid and prM, allowed reliable and selective

417

identification of infected or transfected cells with a construct expressing the viral

418

polyprotein (Figures 2 and 3). Interestingly, for several DENV reporter constructs,

419

nuclear GFP localization was observed in absence of the viral protease (Figure 2A). A

420

possible explanation for this could be that unspecific cleavage of the linker region

421

might be mediated by cellular proteases due to high levels of expression of the

422

reporter construct upon transient transduction.

423

Reporter constructs for detection of flavivirus infection have been described

424

previously were either cytosolic or employed viral non-structural proteins as ER

425

anchors (21–23, 38). Most of these reporter systems rely on the expression of large

426

fragments of viral proteins (21–23) which can alter the physiological stoichiometry of

427

the viral proteins and induce undesired pleiotropic effects. Indeed, even expression of

428

single NS proteins can affect cellular functions, such as alteration of mitochondrial

429

morphodynamics by NS4B (44). In contrast, since our reporter construct does not

430

contain viral sequences, except for the cleavage site, it is less prone to affect cellular

431

pathways and processes.

432

The flexibility granted by the modular nature of our constructs allows for simple

433

adaptation of the reporter system to different viruses that encode proteases acting in

434

close proximity of the ER membranes. This allowed us to rapidly adapt the system to

435

the detection of SARS-CoV-2 infection in cell culture. Transient transduction of cells

436

with lentiviruses coding for the different constructs allowed fast screening and

437

identification of the most suitable cleavage site (Figure 4). Notably, while it was

438

sufficient to use cell pools under antibiotic selection for DENV reporter cell lines

439

Huh7-RC and Lunet-T7-RC, we had to establish single cell clones for the

bioRxiv preprint doi: https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.08.31.276683; this version posted September 1, 2020. The copyright holder for this

440

SARS-CoV-2 reporter proteins because in most cells large fluorescent aggregates

441

were observed (Figure 4A). This is likely due to differences in the ability of cell lines

442

to respond to high levels of GFP fusion proteins. In addition to sorting for cells with

443

lower reporter expression as done here, this problem might be overcome by

444

employing less active promoter or by using an alternative fluorescent protein.

445

Live cell imaging demonstrated that SARS-CoV-2 infected cells can be identified as

446

early as 5.5 h post infection (Figure 5B). Real-time identification of SARS-CoV-2-

447

infected cells is currently mainly performed by employing recombinant viruses

448

expressing reporter genes (45–47). While these studies report robust and reliable

449

identification of infected cells, our reporter cell line has advantages in certain settings.

450

The use of reporter viruses requires molecular clones and the adaptation of the

451

genomic sequence for each different isolate, which for viruses with large RNA

452

genomes like SARS-CoV-2 involves substantial cloning efforts. Additionally, the

453

relatively high mutation and recombination rate of RNA viruses during genome

454

replication makes reporter viruses inherently unstable. Moreover, integration of a

455

reporter gene into the recombinant virus may attenuate the replication efficiency, as

456

observed when comparing WT to DENV-faR virus infection (Figure 3B). In contrast,

457

our cell line allows the detection of wildtype virus isolates, although in this system

458

conserved cleavage site sequences are required.

459

We tested the suitability of the SARS-CoV-2 optimized reporter cell line to assess the

460

antiviral activity of Remdesivir and determined an IC50 of 16 nM in our reporter

461

system. By using N staining as an alternative read-out, we obtained a somewhat lower

462

efficacy of Remdesivir (IC50 = 40 nM), which is closer to the data reported in the

463

literature (42, 43, 48). The reduced sensitivity of the reporter construct, which relies

464

on 3CLpro activity and GFP translocation, might stem from failure to detect cells with

bioRxiv preprint doi: https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.08.31.276683; this version posted September 1, 2020. The copyright holder for this

465

low levels of infection whereas the highly expressed N protein is already detectable

466

by IF. Additionally, the selected cell clone 2 might differ in Remdesivir metabolism

467

which can impact the antiviral efficacy of the nucleoside analogue. It is important to

468

note that the IC50 value varies depending on which cell lines and assays are employed

469

and the IC50 values determined in this study are in a similar range with only a 3-fold

470

difference. Nevertheless, compounds found to exhibit antiviral activity in our reporter

471

construct should be further validated, e.g. by plaque assay and/or viral RNA level

472

quantification. Therefore, the reporter cell line can be employed in a primary screen to

473

lower the number of candidates for validation in more sophisticated and time-

474

consuming assays, thus reducing costs and increasing speed.

475

Two additional applications of our system shall be mentioned. The first is the use for

476

CLEM, a powerful imaging method that can be used to mark and identify cells of

477

interest amongst a large number of non-infected or un-transfected cells and

478

subsequent analysis of this traced cell by electron microscopy methods (49).

479

Secondly, the reporter cell line as described here can also be employed for protease

480

inhibitor screens in areas that do not have access to biosafety level 3 laboratories. This

481

can be done by transient or stable expression of the protease individually and

482

monitoring of the reduction of nuclear GFP as a result of protease inhibition, similar

483

to a recent study (50).

484

In conclusion, we describe a reporter system suitable for the detection of DENV and

485

SARS-CoV-2 infected cells. The system is easy to handle and flexible and should be

486

applicable to any virus encoding a cytoplasmic protease. It is suitable for a large

487

number of methods and assays, including high content screening. In all these respects,

488

we expect this tool to facilitate investigations of virus-host interactions, but also the
