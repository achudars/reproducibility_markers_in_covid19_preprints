Abstract:

53
54

Respiratory viruses such as coronaviruses represent major ongoing global threats,

55

causing epidemics and pandemics with huge economic burden. Rapid spread of virus

56

through populations poses an enormous challenge for outbreak control. Like all

57

respiratory viruses, the most recent novel human coronavirus SARS-CoV-2, initiates

58

infection in the upper respiratory tract (URT). Infected individuals are often

59

asymptomatic, yet highly infectious and readily transmit virus. A therapy that restricts

60

initial replication in the URT has the potential to prevent progression of severe lower

61

respiratory tract disease as well as limiting person-to-person transmission.

62

We show that prophylactic intra-nasal administration of the TLR2/6 agonist INNA-051 in

63

a SARS-CoV-2 ferret infection model effectively reduces levels of viral RNA in the nose

64

and throat. The results of our study support clinical development of a therapy based on

65

prophylactic TLR2/6 innate immune activation in the URT to reduce SARS-CoV-2

66

transmission and provide protection against COVID-19.

71

Coronaviruses (CoV) are pleomorphic, positive-sense, single-stranded RNA-enveloped

72

viruses, members of the Coronoviridae family, that mainly infect wild animals and cause

73

mild disease1. In addition, seven human CoVs that belong to either the

74

Alphacoronavirus- or Betacoronavirus-genus have now been identified. Four of these

75

human CoVs usually cause a mild, upper respiratory tract illness (common cold). Another

76

three novel human CoVs have emerged in the past two decades through transmission

77

to humans via an intermediate animal host2, and caused outbreaks of significant

78

respiratory morbidity and mortality: in 2003, Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome

79

(SARS) CoV in China3, in 2012 Middle Eastern Respiratory Syndrome (MERS) CoV in

80

Saudi Arabia4 and more recently in December 2019, SARS-CoV-2, a novel CoV type

81

identified in lower respiratory tract of patients presenting viral pneumonia in Wuhan,

82

China5. Unlike the highly pathogenic SARS or MERS CoVs, SARS-CoV-2 infections

83

have spread rapidly around the globe, causing broad spectrum respiratory symptoms,

84

from very mild to severe, life-threatening disease (COVID-19) mostly in at risk

85

populations such as the elderly and those with comorbidities.

86

As with other respiratory CoVs, SARS-CoV-2 primarily spreads via the airborne route,

87

with respiratory droplets expelled by infected individuals6. Virus can be transmitted

88

from symptomatic, as well as pre- or asymptomatic individuals7,8, with asymptomatic

89

individuals being able to shed virus, and therefore being capable to transmit the disease,

90

for longer than those with symptoms9. As with other respiratory viruses such as influenza,

91

recent evidence suggests that, the epithelium of the upper respiratory tract (URT) is the

92

initial site of SARS-CoV-2 infection10,11. This is consistent with the abundant nasal

93

epithelial cell expression of the SARS-CoV-2 receptor, angiotensin-converting enzyme 2

94

(ACE2) and its decreasing expression throughout the lower respiratory tract11.

95

A topical treatment of the URT that boosts anti-viral immunity and restricts viral replication

96

is a promising method to promote viral clearance, reduce viral shedding and

97

transmission. The TLRs are key microbe-recognition receptors with a crucial role in

98

activation of host defence and protection from infections and therefore attractive drug

99

targets against infectious diseases12-14. Synthetic agonists of the intracellular viral

100

DNA/RNA-recognising TLR molecules, TLR3, TLR7/8 and TLR9, are capable of

101

boosting protective innate immune responses against respiratory viruses. However,

102

their success in the clinic has been limited, due to short-duration of benefit or induction

103

of adverse effects, related to the release of pro-inflammatory cytokines and activation

104

of the type-1 Interferon pathway15-18. TLRs expressed on the cell surface such as TLR2

105

offer an alternative approach. TLR2 dimerizes with TLR1 or TLR6 to recognize a broad

106

variety of commensal and pathogenic microbial molecules and its activation is tightly

107

regulated to maintain immune homeostasis19. A series of novel synthetic molecules,

108

named the INNA compounds, have been developed with TLR2/6 agonist properties.

109

Importantly, TLR2/6 agonists of the INNA compound series do not directly activate

110

Type-1 interferons (unpublished data).

111

Airways administration of INNA compounds has been shown to protect from lethal

112

influenza virus infection, prevent viral transmission and secondary bacterial

113

superinfections in mouse disease models20-22. Intranasal (i.n.) treatment with INNA

114

compounds also reduces viral load and lung inflammation in mouse models of

115

rhinovirus infection (unpublished data). The demonstrated prophylactic benefit is

116

associated with fast TLR2/6-mediated up-regulation of a series of innate immune

117

response elements in airway epithelial cells, defined by early, rapid expression of NF-

118

κB-regulated anti-microbial genes, including IFN-λ and chemokines, that precede

119

immune cell recruitment and support prolonged antiviral defence, suppresses viral

120

load and virus-induced pulmonary inflammation (unpublished data).

121

To determine whether TLR2/6 agonists are also active against SARS-CoV-2, we used

122

prophylactic i.n. administration of the novel compound INNA-051, in a SARS-CoV-2

123

challenge ferret model23.

124

Ferret challenge models are commonly used to understand human respiratory virus-

125

induced diseases and to evaluate the efficacy of related vaccines and drugs24,25. Use of

126

ferrets is appropriate in the case of SARS-CoV-2 infection, as they express the virus

127

entry ACE2 receptor in their airways26-28 and SARS-CoV-2 i.n. inoculation in ferrets

128

results in virus replication in the URT and dose-dependent viral shedding23,28.

129

In the present study, ferrets received two i.n. administrations of INNA-051 or vehicle-

130

control (PBS), at 4 days before and 1 day prior to i.n. challenge with 5.0 x 106 plaque-

131

forming units (PFU) of SARS-CoV-2 in 1ml volume (day 0). Four groups (6

132

animals/group) were used: Group 1 received two 1 ml doses (100μg/mL) INNA-051

133

(high dose); Group 2 received two 1 ml doses (20μg/mL) INNA-051 doses (low dose);

134

Group 3 received one 1ml dose (20ug/mL) INNA-051 at -4 days and one 1 ml dose

135

INNA-051 (100μg/mL) at -1 day (mixed dose); Group 4 received two doses of vehicle

136

(PBS) alone. After inoculation with SARS-CoV-2, ferrets were monitored for 12 days.

137

In life samples were taken at days 1, 3, 5, 7, 10 and 12, with scheduled culls at days

138

3 (n=6) and end of study days 12-14 (n=18) (Fig 1A).

139

Previous in vivo studies in mice have shown that respiratory application of INNA

140

compounds have a good safety profile, without significant pro-inflammatory side

141

effects or systemic cytokine release syndrome (unpublished data). Intranasal

142

administration to ferrets of two doses of INNA-051, prior to SARS-CoV-2 challenge,

143

did not induce observable or, measurable clinical signs of inflammation or changes in

144

the animal’s activity.

145

Assessment of body temperature revealed some variation between treatment groups

146

(Fig 1B), with 2 of 6 ferrets in the INNA-051 high dose group 1 showing a transient

147

increase of temperature >40.0ºC, only after the first, but not the second dose. No

148

significant changes from baseline were noticed in body weight, with the variation

149

among groups being less than 2% (Fig 1C).

150

It has been previously described that SARS-CoV-2 infection in ferrets is not associated

151

with the development of severe symptomatology, but it represents a robust model of

152

mild disease that allows the study of respiratory viral replication23,29. In this context, no

153

obvious differences in clinical disease signs were observed among treatment groups

154

in this experimental study. Assessment of body temperature (Fig 1B) and weight loss

155

(Fig 1C) did not reveal significant variation between the INNA-051 and PBS-treated

156

groups.

157

To follow the dynamics of SARS-CoV-2 viral replication and assess the impact of

158

INNA-051 prophylactic treatment, nasal wash and throat swab samples were taken 4

159

days before viral challenge and at 1, 3, 5, 7, 10 and 12-days post challenge (dpc).

160

Analysis of viral RNA in nasal wash samples at 1 dpc confirmed infection in all

161

treatment groups, with lower viral RNA levels detected in INNA-051 treatment Group

162

3 (Fig. 2A). Reduction of viral RNA in treatment Group 3 was also evident at 3 dpc

163

(p=0.0155) (Fig. 2A). By 5 dpc. all INNA-051 treated groups had significantly (>10-

164

fold) reduced viral RNA compared to the vehicle-control group (2-way ANOVA

165

Dunnett’s multiple comparison test: Group 1 p=0.0244; Group 2 p=0.0107; Group 3

166

p=0.0071 compared to vehicle-control Group 4) (Fig 2A). On 5 dpc, the viral RNA

167

levels in the nasal washes of the majority of INNA-051 treated animals remained low

168

or below quantifiable limits throughout the course of infection. Viral RNA levels were

169

found to be below the level of quantification in nasal washes of PBS-treated animals

170

from 10 dpc onwards (Fig 2A).

171

Analysis of viral RNA in throat swabs provided further evidence of the capacity of

172

INNA-051 treatment to reduce SARS-CoV-2 in the URT (Fig 2B). On 3 dpc lower viral

173

RNA levels were found in throat swabs of INNA-051 treated animals, with significantly

174

greater reduction again observed (p=0.0345) in INNA-051 treatment Group 3. By 5

175

dpc, all groups treated with INNA-051 had significantly reduced (>10 fold) viral RNA

176

levels, compared to the vehicle control group (2-way ANOVA Dunnett’s multiple

177

comparison: Group 1 p=0.0002, Group 2 p=<0.0001 and Group 3 p=0.0039 compared

178

to vehicle control Group 4). Highly significantly reduction in viral RNA in the throat of

179

INNA-051 treated animals was also apparent on 7 dpc (2-way ANOVA Dunnett’s

180

multiple comparison: Group 1 p=0.0014, Group 2 p=<0.0001 and Group 3 p=0.0002

181

compared to vehicle control Group 4), while by 10 dpc to the end of the study, the

182

levels of viral RNA were below the limit of quantitation in all treatment groups (Fig 2B).

183

Because all INNA-051 treatment groups exhibited reduced viral RNA in the nose and

184

throat, we combined these groups into a single data set (supplementary figures) and

185

compared to the group treated with vehicle. Using 2-way ANOVA Sidak’s multiple

186

comparison test, significant (>10 fold) reduction in nasal viral RNA was observed at 5

187

dpc (p=0.0057) and highly significant (p<0.0001), greater than 10-fold reduction in

188

throat viral RNA was apparent from 5 to 7 dpc following INNA-051 i.n. treatment

189

(Figure S1). Group 2 (20ug/mL) appears to be the most optimal dosing in this study

190

After 5 days post-exposure to SARS-CoV-2, INNA-051 had statistically significant

191

reduction of virus in throat swabs (p=<0.0001) with 24 fold (96% reduction) and nasal

192

wash (p=0.0107) 15 fold (93% reduction) in this group compared to untreated animals.

193

These results indicate a similar profile with the protective effects of natural acquired

194

immunity in the ferret challenge model, as observed following re-challenge with SARS-

195

CoV-223.

196

To assess SARS-CoV-2 detected beyond the URT, lung tissue samples were

197

collected, on scheduled cull day 3 (6/24 animals) and days 12-14 (18/24 animals) dpc

198

and analysed for viral RNA levels. On day 3 dpc, two culled ferrets from the control

199

vehicle group had detectable viral RNA levels (7.42x104 and 2.86x104 copies/ml) (Fig

200

2C). There was one ferret in Group 1 showing detectable, but below the quantifiable

201

limit, viral RNA, and no other INNA-051 treated ferrets showing detectable viral RNA

202

in lung tissue on day 3 and days 12-14 dpc

203

This study provides evidence supporting a novel approach to prevent SARS-CoV-2

204

transmission, based on reduced viral shedding, following prophylactic i.n

205

administration of INNA-051. Global efforts for prevention of SARS-CoV-2 infection

206

have so far been mostly focused on social distancing and hygiene measures as well

207

as on R&D efforts for the development of vaccines. Our data demonstrate, for the first

208

time, in an in vivo SARS-CoV-2 infection model, that INNA-051 is highly effective at

209

reducing URT viral shedding, providing the potential to control virus transmission and

210

COVID-19 disease.

211

TLR2 stimulation at mucosal surfaces triggers rapid up-regulation of protective, innate

212

immune defence responses, and also activates counter-regulatory signalling that

213

suppresses development of excessive inflammation and tissue damage and promotes

214

the integrity of local epithelial barrier function30,31. In addition, the INNA compounds

215

have been specifically designed to exert TLR2-mediated pharmacological activity on

216

mucosal epithelium, without being systemically absorbed (Ena Respiratory

217

unpublished data), a property that is expected to facilitate their development as safe,

218

antiviral drug candidates. The lack of obvious clinical signs of inflammation following

219

the administration of two doses of INNA-051 administered i.n supports this view.

220

Histopathology from the study indicates that i.n. INNA-051 administration does not

221

exacerbate SARS-CoV-2 pathology in the ferret lung in this setting (Figure S2).

222

It has been previously shown that i.n administration of an INNA compound in a mouse

223

model of influenza triggers a cascade of innate immune signals that results in

224

reduction of viral load, prevention of lower-respiratory infection and viral transmission

225

between animals20-22. In a mouse rhinovirus infection model, we have shown that

226

prophylactic treatment with an INNA compounds primes airway mucosal immunity

227

providing prolong protection (unpublished data). Effective and accelerated anti-viral

228

responses against rhinovirus have also been demonstrated following INNA compound

229

treatment in an in vitro model of primary bronchial epithelial cells from healthy

230

individuals and donors with asthma (unpublished data).

231

Although the ferret SARS-CoV-2 model has limitations and may not represent the severe

232

spectrum of COVID-19 disease, our findings are highly encouraging and indicative of the

233

potential impact i.n. administration of INNA-051 prophylactically may have against

234

SARS-CoV-2 in humans. The fact that a significant reduction of URT viral RNA levels

235

was observed in INNA-051-treated outbred ferrets during the peak of viral replication

236

(5-7 days dpc) in this model23 implies airway immunity priming and enhancement of

237

antiviral host defence. The predictive value of antiviral effectiveness data from

238

respiratory viral infection ferret models and translation into human infectious disease has

239

been established25,32. For this reason, the SARS-CoV-2 ferret model has been used,

240

during the current pandemic, to evaluate the therapeutic effect of a number of FDAPage 8 of 24

bioRxiv preprint doi: https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.09.25.309914; this version posted September 25, 2020. The copyright holder for this

241

approved/repurposed drugs including, lopinavir-ritonavir, hydroxychloroquine sulfate,

242

or emtricitabine-tenofovir33. These drugs were found to have no or only modest (~4

243

fold for emtricitabine-tenofovir) effect against SARS-CoV2 viral replication, as

244

measured by viral titres in nasal wash from the ferrets33.

245

Substantial reduction of SARS-CoV viral shedding in the URT and therefore control of

246

respiratory virus transmission may not be easily achievable without potentiation of

247

airways antiviral immune defences34. Systemic antiviral drugs, as well as vaccines

248

may not be effective in halting respiratory viral transmission even if they achieve

249

suppression of clinical disease and in fact preliminary results from an experimental

250

study with one of the leading SARS-CoV-2 vaccine candidates (an adenovirus-

251

construct expressing SARS-CoV-2 spike protein) in non-human primates have shown

252

little effect on the virus load in nasal washes35. To address these potential limitations,

253

particularly during the urgent circumstances of an epidemic, parallel use of an i.n.

254

administered innate immune modulator with the characteristics of INNA-051 may be

255

highly appropriate to rapidly boost innate immunity at the primary site of respiratory

256

infection which is protective within days of treatment. The use of i.n. INNA-051 for

257

antiviral respiratory prophylaxis therefore offers several additional advantages,

258

including fast-acting protection, and is in contrast to vaccines that take 2-4 weeks to

259

mount a protective response. The limited risk for development of antiviral resistance,

260

the option of self-administration and the non-prohibitive cost for large-scale

261

manufacturing are also especially attractive factors.

262

In conclusion, this study provides evidence that prophylactic i.n. administration of the

263

TLR2/6 agonist INNA-051 offers a promising approach for prevention and

264

management of SARS-CoV-2 infection that can be used as a stand-alone method of

265

antiviral prophylaxis and is complimentary to potential vaccination programs. This

266

approach is particularly appealing to individuals at elevated risk of community

267

transmission or development of severe disease, including front-line health care

268

workers, vulnerable communities, the elderly, the immunocompromised and those

269

with existing comorbidities.

Methods

313

Animals.

314

Twenty-four healthy, female outbred ferrets (Mustela putorius furo) aged 6-8 months

315

were obtained from a UK Home Office accredited supplier. The mean weight at the

316

time of first INNA-051 treatment was 845g/ferret (range 740-1040g). Animals were

317

housed in social groups of six prior to and post INNA-051 treatment at Advisory

318

Committee on Dangerous Pathogens (ACDP) containment level 2. Animals were

319

transferred to ACDP containment level 3 and housed in pairs post SARS-CoV-2

320

challenge. Cages met with the UK Home Office Code of Practice for the Housing and

321

Care of Animals Bred, Supplied or Used for Scientific Procedures (December 2014).

322

Access to food and water was ad libitum and environmental enrichment was provided.

323

All experimental work was conducted in accordance with and under the authority of a

324

UK Home Office approved project licence that had been subject to local ethical review

325

at PHE Porton Down by the Animal Welfare and Ethical Review Body (AWERB) as

326

required by the Home Office Animals (Scientific Procedures) Act 1986. Animals were

327

sedated by intramuscular injection of ketamine/xylazine (17.9 mg/kg and 3.6 mg/kg

328

bodyweight) for administering of treatments, in-life sampling and viral challenge.

329
330

INNA-051.

331

INNA-051 belongs to a series of closely-related, pegylated synthetic analogues of the

332

diacylated lipopeptide, S-[2,3-bis(palmitoyl oxy)propyl] cysteine (Pam2Cys) (INNA

333

compound series), with selective TLR2/TLR6 agonist activity. Pam2Cys is inherently

334

insoluble and has been rendered soluble by others through addition of the amino acid

335

motif SK436. Oligo lysine sequences have, however, been shown to be toxic, albeit at

336

high concentration37 and to modulate viral infection processes independent of TLR

337

activation38. Any off-target effects were mitigated by incorporating polyethylene glycol

338

as a solubilising agent, in the INNA compound series38. The EC50s for INNA-051 for

339

the human TLR2/6 receptor is calculated at 40.1 pg/mL or ~19pM.

340

Freeze dried INNA-051 provided by Ena Respiratory, Melbourne, Australia was

341

resuspended in phosphate buffered saline (PBS) (1mg/ml) and stored 2-8ºC.

342

Immediately prior to treatment, INNA-051 (1mg/ml) was further diluted in PBS to the

343

required treatment doses; high dose (100µg/ml), low dose (20µg/ml) and mixed dose

344

(20µg/ml first dose and 100µg/ml second dose).

Inoculum.

347

SARS-CoV-2 Victoria/01/202039 was generously provided by Peter Doherty Institute

348

for Infection and Immunity, Melbourne, Australia at P1 and passaged twice in

349

Vero/hSLAM cells [ECACC 04091501], obtained from the European Collection of

350

Authenticated Cell Cultures (ECACC) PHE, Porton Down, UK. Whole genome

351

sequencing was performed, on the challenge isolate, SISPA protocol and then

352

sequenced using Nanopore as described previously40. Virus titre was determined by

353

plaque assay on Vero/E6 cells [ECACC 85020206]. Challenge substance dilutions

354

were conducted in Phosphate Buffer Saline (PBS). Challenge virus was delivered by

355

intranasal instillation (1.0 ml total, 0.5 ml per nostril) at 5.0 x 106 pfu/ml.

356
357

Experimental Design.

358

Experimental design and viral challenge dose were informed by a previous dose-

359

dependent ferret study23. Prior to commencing the experiment, animals were randomly

360

assigned to the four treatment groups, to minimise bias. A temperature/ID chip (Bio-

361

Thermo Identichip, Animalcare Ltd, UK) was inserted subcutaneously into the dorsal

362

cervical region of each animal.

363
364

INNA-051 was delivered by intranasal instillation (1.0 ml total, 0.5 ml per nostril) to

365

three groups (n=6) of ferrets 4 days and 1 day prior to challenge. On each day, group

366

1 received a high dose [100µg/ml], group 2 a low dose [20µg/ml] and group 3 received

367

a 20µg/ml dose 4 days prior to challenge and a 100µg/ml] dose 1 day before challenge.

368

PBS was delivered to control group ferrets (n=6) 4 days and 1 day prior to challenge.

369

Two ferrets each from the high dose, low dose and control groups were scheduled for

370

euthanasia on day 3 (n=6). Remaining ferrets (n=18) were scheduled for euthanasia

371

on days 12-14; high and low dose [day 12 n=1, day 13 n=2, day 14 n=1], mixed dose

372

[n=2 days 12-14] and control [n=2 days 12 and 14].

373
374

Nasal washes and throat swabs for all ferrets were taken prior to first treatment, at

375

days 1 and 3 pc (n=24) and at days 5, 7, 10 and 12 pc for surviving ferrets (n=18). At

376

necropsy, tissue samples were taken for histopathology and analysed by PCR. Nasal

377

washes were obtained by flushing the nasal cavity with 2 ml PBS. Cotton throat swabs

378

(Koehler Technische Produkten, VWR) were gently stroked across the back of the

379

pharynx in the tonsillar area and retained in viral transport media (VTM). Throat swabs

380

were processed, and aliquots were stored in AVL at -80ºC until assay.

381
382

Clinical and euthanasia observations.

383

Animals were monitored for clinical signs of disease twice daily (approximately 8 hours

384

apart) for the entirety of the experiment. Clinical signs of disease were assigned a

385

score based upon the following criteria. Activity was scored as follows; 0 = alert and

386

playful, 1 = alert, playful when stimulated, 2 = alert, not playful when stimulated, 3 =

387

not alert or playful. No clinical signs were noted throughout the experiment. To meet

388

the requirement of the project license, immobility, neurological signs or a sudden drop

389

in temperature were predetermined automatic euthanasia criteria. Animals were also

390

deemed to have reached a humane endpoint if their body weight was at or below 30%

391

baseline. If any ferret reached any of these three criteria, they were to be immediately

392

euthanised using a UK Home Office approved Schedule 1 procedure. No animals

393

reached these end-points during this study.

394
395

Temperature was taken using a microchip reader and implanted temperature/ID chip.

396

Temperature was recorded at each clinical scoring point using the chip to ensure any

397

peak of fever was recorded. Animals were weighed at the same time each day

398

throughout the experiment.

399
400

Necropsy Procedures.

401

Ferrets were anaesthetised with ketamine/xylazine (17.9 mg/kg and 3.6 mg/kg

402

bodyweight) and exsanguination was effected via cardiac puncture, followed by

403

injection of an anaesthetic overdose (sodium pentabarbitone Dolelethal, Vetquinol UK

404

Ltd, 140 mg/kg). A necropsy was performed immediately after confirmation of death.

405

The left lung was dissected and used for subsequent virology procedures.

406
407

RNA Extraction.

408

RNA was isolated from nasal wash, throat swabs, EDTA treated whole blood, BAL

409

and lung tissue. Weighed lung tissue was homogenised and inactivated in RLT

410

(Qiagen) supplemented with 1%(v/v) Beta-mercaptoethanol. Tissue homogenate was

411

then centrifuged through a QIAshredder homogenizer (Qiagen) and supplemented

412

with ethanol as per manufacturer’s instructions. Non-tissue samples were inactivated

413

in AVL (Qiagen) and ethanol. Downstream extraction on all inactivated samples was

414

then performed using the BioSprint™96 One-For-All vet kit (Indical) and Kingfisher

415

Flex platform as per manufacturer’s instructions.

416
417

Quantification of Viral Loads by RT-qPCR.

418

Reverse transcription-quantitative polymerase chain reaction (RT-qPCR) targeting a

419

region of the SARS-CoV-2 nucleocapsid (N) gene was used to determine viral loads

420

and was performed using TaqPath™ 1-Step RT-qPCR Master Mix, CG (Applied

421

Biosystems™), 2019-nCoV CDC RUO Kit (Integrated DNA Technologies) and

422

QuantStudio™ 7 Flex Real-Time PCR System. Sequences of the N1 primers and

423

probe were: 2019-nCoV_N1-forward, 5’ GACCCCAAAATCAGCGAAAT 3’; 2019-

424

nCoV_N1-reverse, 5’ TCTGGTTACTGCCAGTTGAATCTG 3’; 2019-nCoV_N1-probe,

425

5’ FAM-ACCCCGCATTACGTTTGGTGGACC-BHQ1 3’. The cycling conditions were:

426

25°C for 2 minutes, 50°C for 15 minutes, 95°C for 2 minutes, followed by 45 cycles of

427

95°C for 3 seconds, 55°C for 30 seconds. The quantification standard was in vitro

428

transcribed RNA of the SARS-CoV-2 N ORF (accession number NC_045512.2) with

429

quantification between 1 x 101 and 1 x 106 copies/µl. Positive samples detected below

430

the lower limit of quantification (LLOQ) were assigned the value of 5 copies/µl, whilst

431

undetected samples were assigned the value of < 2.3 copies/µl, equivalent to the

432

assays lower limit of detection (LLOD).

433
434

Histopathological Analysis.

435

Samples from the left cranial and left caudal lung lobe together with nasal cavity, were

436

fixed by immersion in 10% neutral-buffered formalin and processed routinely into

437

paraffin wax. Nasal cavity samples were decalcified using an EDTA-based solution

438

prior to embedding. 4 µm sections were cut and stained with haematoxylin and eosin

439

(H&E) and examined microscopically. In addition, samples were stained using the

440

RNAscope technique to identify the SARS-CoV-2 virus RNA. Briefly, tissues were pre-

441

treated with hydrogen peroxide for 10 minutes (room temperature), target retrieval for

442

15 mins (98-101°C) and protease plus for 30 mins (40°C) (Advanced Cell Diagnostics).

443

A V-nCoV2019-S probe (Cat No. 848561, Advanced Cell Diagnostics) was incubated

444

on the tissues for 2 hours at 40°C. Amplification of the signal was carried out following

445

the RNAscope protocol using the RNAscope 2.5 HD Detection kit – Red (Advanced

446

Cell Diagnostics).

451

fitted to a straight line in a QQ plot confirming normal distributions for comparison. A

452

p-value <0.05 was considered statistically significant. Statistical analyses were

453

performed using GraphPad Prism, version 8.4.2.

Figure 1. Clinical observations. (a) Schematic of experimental design. Ferrets

585

received INNA-051 and PBS treatments 4 days and 1 day prior to challenge with 5.0

586

x 106 pfu/ml SARS-CoV-2. Nasal wash and throat swabs were collected at days 1, 3,

587

5, 7, 10 & 12 post challenge (p.c.) for all treatment groups and control group.

588

Scheduled culls were performed for 6/24 ferrets on day 3 p.c. and 18/24 ferrets on

589

days 12-14 p.c. (b) Temperatures were measured twice daily (approximately 8 hours

590

apart), using implanted temperature/ID chips. Mean temperatures +/- standard error

591

of the mean (SEM) are displayed. Temperature dip post SARS-CoV-2 challenge (*)

592

was attributed to sedation. (b) Weight was recorded daily and percentage change from

593

the ferret weight prior to treatment plotted. Mean percentage weight change +/- SEM

594

are displayed.
