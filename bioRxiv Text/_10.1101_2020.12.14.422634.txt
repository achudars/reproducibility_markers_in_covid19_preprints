Abstract
The SARS-CoV-2 coronavirus outbreak continues to spread at a rapid rate worldwide. The main
protease (Mpro) is an attractive target for anti-COVID-19 agents. Unfortunately, unexpected
difficulties have been encountered in the design of specific inhibitors. Here, by analyzing an
ensemble of ~30,000 SARS-CoV-2 Mpro conformations from crystallographic studies and
molecular simulations, we show that small structural variations in the binding site dramatically
impact ligand binding properties. Hence, traditional druggability indices fail to adequately
discriminate between highly and poorly druggable conformations of the binding site. By
performing ~200 virtual screenings of compound libraries on selected protein structures, we
redefine the protein’s druggability as the consensus chemical space arising from the multiple
conformations of the binding site formed upon ligand binding. This procedure revealed a unique
SARS-CoV-2 Mpro blueprint that led to a definition of a specific structure-based pharmacophore.
The latter explains the poor transferability of potent SARS-CoV Mpro inhibitors to SARS-CoV-2

Mpro, despite the identical sequences of the active sites. Importantly, application of the
pharmacophore predicted novel high affinity inhibitors of SARS-CoV-2 Mpro, that were validated
by in vitro assays performed here and by a newly solved X-ray crystal structure. These results
provide a strong basis for effective rational drug design campaigns against SARS-CoV-2 Mpro
and a new computational approach to screen protein targets with malleable binding sites.

In December 2019, a new coronavirus (CoV), belonging to the clade b of the Betacoronavirus
viral genus, caused an outbreak of pulmonary disease in the Hubei province in China.1, 2 In the
first months of 2020, the new pandemic spread globally and it is still continuing. The virus shares
more than 80% of its genome with that of the SARS coronavirus discovered in 2002 (SARSCoV).1, 2 Hence it has been named severe acute respiratory syndrome-coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV2) by the International Committee on Taxonomy of Viruses.

The most promising tools for the cessation of the epidemic spread of COVID-19 are vaccines.3
The majority of them could trigger an immunogenic response using inactivated viral vectors or
RNA sequences encoding SARS-CoV-2 spike glycoprotein.4 Unfortunately, the SARS-CoV-2
spike protein uses conformational masking and glycan shielding to frustrate the immune
response, possibly hindering vaccine effectiveness.5

Interfering with viral replication is an alternative and promising strategy of treatment. In this
context, the chymotrypsin-like proteinase (often referred to as the main protease, Mpro hereafter)
is an excellent pharmaceutical target.6, 7 It does not depend on host immunogenic responses and
it is essential for generating the 16 non-structural proteins, critical to the formation of the replicase
complex.

Mpros are highly conserved enzymes across CoVs. 8, 9 SARS-CoV Mpro was already suggested
as one of the main drug targets in the pandemic associated with that virus, about 15 years ago. 1012
Inhibitors of proteases (e.g. aspartyl protease) are also common drugs used in the clinic against
other deadly viruses, e.g. HIV-1.13

The SARS-CoV Mpro active form is a homodimer (Figure 1A), with each monomer consisting of
N-terminal, catalytic and C-terminal regions14 (Figure 1B). Mpros were shown to process
polyproteins on diverse cleavage sites, using a cysteine/histidine catalytic dyad: 15 the histidine
(His41 in SARS-CoV-2) forms a hydrogen bond (Hbond) with a water molecule that, in turn,
interacts with an aspartate (Asp187) and a histidine (His164) side chain. Asp187 is further
stabilized through a salt-bridge with a nearby arginine (Arg40, Figure 1C). In this way, His41 can
act as a base, extracting a proton from the catalytic cysteine (Cys145) sidechain and activating it
for the nucleophilic attack that cuts the polypeptide.

SARS-CoV-2 Mpro shares 96% sequence identity with Mpro from SARS-CoV (Section S1, Figure
S1A). Twelve residues differ between both Mpros and only one, namely, Ser46 in SARS-CoV-2
(Ala46 in SARS-CoV), is located at the mouth of the active site cavity (Figure S1B). The binding
sites share 100% of sequence identity (Figure S1A). Thus, exploiting the known libraries of SARSCoV Mpro inhibitors has been a strategy followed by many research groups. Unfortunately, most
SARS-CoV Mpro inhibitors with good (nM) activity against SARS-CoV Mpro in vitro and in cellbased assays, exhibited limited (sub-µM) potency against the protein from SARS-CoV-2 in
enzymatic assays, and low-µM IC50 values (4-5 µM) in cell-based assays.16, 17

A similar scenario has emerged from the virtual screening (VS) of Mpro inhibitors towards SARSCoV-2. Indeed, none of these strategies: (i) repurposing of SARS-CoV drugs for SARS-CoV-2,18,
19
(ii) Deep Docking trained on SARS-CoV Mpro inhibitors,20 (iii) libraries of the other SARS
proteases,21-23 and (iv) clinically approved drugs for other SARS Mpros or other similar
proteases,24-29 led to clinical advances. Because only 12 residues, far from the binding site, differ
between SARS-CoV Mpro and SARS-CoV-2 Mpro, the mutation of distant residues can
substantially contribute to the binding site plasticity and to the ligand binding through allosteric
regulation.30 This is both disappointing and puzzling from a pharmaceutical perspective. Recently,
however, it has been shown that the dipeptide prodrug GC376, and its parent GC373 inhibit the
two proteases with IC50 values in the nanomolar range. 31 This suggests that, despite the intrinsic
and significant differences between the two Mpros, common binding features against some
classes of high-affinity ligands are retained.

Molecular dynamics (MD) simulations18 provided hints to address this riddle: they showed that the
SARS-CoV Mpro active sites display major differences in both shape and size. In particular, while
both Mpros reduce their accessible volume upon inhibitor binding by approximately 20%, the
maximal volume of the holo SARS-CoV Mpro active site is over 50% larger than that of SARSCoV-2. In addition, the accessibility of the binding hotspots (i.e. the key residues for substrate
binding) and the flexibility of one of the two loops delimiting the binding pockets (ASL1 in Figure
1B) differs between the two Mpros.18 The simulations indicate that the binding sites of the two
Mpros are dynamically diverse and that ligand binding can impact them differently.

Therefore, transferable binding features across Mpros, as well as unique ones for SARS-CoV-2
are difficult to predict: the exceptional flexibility and plasticity of the binding site is here coupled
with large adjustments of the cavity shape in response to the binding of an inhibitor. This clearly
emerges from an analysis of the SARS-CoV-2 Mpro binding pocket’s conformational changes
(performed here) across the majority of the 196 X-ray crystal structures available in the Protein
Data Bank up to September 30 th 2020.18, 32-34 This flexibility makes a rational drug-design
approach extremely challenging:18, 35 the screening potential of Mpro conformational space is too

It is therefore imperative to identify the relationship between SARS-CoV-2 conformational space,
flexibility, druggability and ligand binding. Here, we analyzed the mentioned 196 X-ray crystal
structures, along with about ~31,000 conformations extracted, not only from the longest (100 µs)
MD simulation of SARS-CoV-2 MPro so far37, but also from binding site enhanced sampling
simulations carried out here. Among these structures, we selected ~24,000 conformations for
which we systematically performed druggability analyses on the binding sites. The top 110
druggable structures were selected for virtual screening of a sample library of ~12,600 ligands.
The latter includes marketed drugs and compounds under development, the internal chemical
libraries from Fraunhofer Institute and the Dompè pharma company, as well as the so-far known
inhibitors of SARS-CoV Mpro from literature.

We redefine here the protein druggability in a new way exploiting the chemical space shaped by
the different configurations of the binding site upon virtual screening. Specifically, we identified a
consensus protein-ligand interaction fingerprint across the chemical space and the corresponding
SARS-CoV-2 Mpro unique structure-based pharmacophore. Our pharmacophore was able to
identify known nM-binders (IC50 ≤ 400 nM) of SARS-CoV-2 Mpro and to distinguish those from
micromolar inhibitors. The latter was able to identify Myricetin and Benserazide as nM inhibitors,
here experimentally validated by enzymatic activity binding assay. The predicted binding of
Myricetin is also in striking agreement with the recently solved X-ray crystal structure by some of
us. Our pharmacophore also provides a rationale for the variability in ligand affinity of currently
known SARS-CoV ligands and for the general lack of transferability of SARS-CoV ligands to
SARS-CoV-2, shedding light on the complexity, plasticity and druggability of SARS-CoV-2 Mpro.

To understand how Mpro’s binding site conformation affects the druggability and the chemical
space of selected binders, we start by considering ~30,000 Mpro conformations spanning
different binding site arrangements and flexibility obtained from different sources (Table 1). These
include:

analyzing all of them, we selected 43 structures for follow-up analysis. These exhibit a RMSD
lower than 1 Angstrom with respect to the excluded ones. Therefore, they can be considered a
good representative ensemble of the overall deposited SARS-CoV-2 X-ray crystal structures (“Xray ensemble” hereafter, see Table S1 for details).

collections of 30 and 40 representative conformations extracted from a three-state and a fourstate Markov state model (MSM), respectively (see Section S2, Figure S2). The MSM analysis
was performed on the 100 µs-long MD trajectory. These are included to identify conformations
representing structural changes potentially related to binding.

Next, we calculated specific binding site parameters for the ensembles. These include the volume,
the hydrophobicity/hydrophilicity and others (see Supplementary Section S3 for the complete list).
We discuss only these two parameters, because they turn out to be key descriptors of the SARSCoV-2 Mpro active site druggability (see below). The latter was evaluated with the “druggability”

suite 2019-4 (Schrödinger, LLC, New York, NY, 2019) and the CNN and LR (Convolution Neural
Network and Linear Regression) druggability models41 as implemented in the TRAPP package.42
Although TRAPP and SiteMap use different approaches for computing the pocket characteristics
(3D grid-based versus residue-based), the trends in the computed parameters are similar.

From this analysis, we conclude the following:

(i) The binding site volumes computed with TRAPP for the holo X-ray crystal structures are
distributed over a slightly larger and more variable range of values than that for the apo X-ray
crystal structures (Figure 2A, Figure S3). The distribution of volumes is higher in the MD and
enhanced sampling simulations: for instance, in the MD10000 ensemble, the volume of the apo
protein has a variation of as much as 48% (Figure 2A) with respect to the average value. Similar
trends were observed for volumes computed with SiteMap (see Table S2). This difference in
volume distributions between X-ray crystal structures and MD snapshots could be caused by
crystal packing. We therefore calculated the minimum distance between two crystallographic
symmetry images, as well as the minimum distance between the binding site residues and the
nearest image (see Section S3.2). Depending on the space group, the minimum distance between
a non-hydrogen atom in the binding site and an image atom turns out to span between ~2.4 Å
and ~9.3 Å (Table S3, Figure S5). Therefore, crystal packing might constrain the binding site of
some of the crystal structures to more compact conformations.

During the MD simulations, on the other hand, the large range and variability in binding site
volume are associated with conformational changes of loops ASL1 (res. 22-53) and ASL2 (res.
184-194) (Figure 2B). It can be seen that ASL1 is more flexible than ASL2, from the MSM analysis
(Section S2) and by calculation of the residue occurrence in the binding site (Section S3, Figure
S3). Volume variability also results from the transient participation (with a frequency of ~25%) of
the N- and C-terminal tails of the adjacent subunit in the binding site (Figure 2C). During the MD
simulation, these two termini move in the proximity of the pocket. For the seven apo X-ray crystal
structures, where the termini are resolved (Table S1), the C-terminus is never close to the binding
sites, whereas the N-terminus is always so (see Figure 2D). In the holo crystal structures, the Nand C-terminal tails of the adjacent subunit can both be found close to the binding site (see Figure
2D). A similar scenario is observed for the holo structures in the LRIP/tC ensemble, where both
terminals are present in the binding pocket even more often (in about 40% of simulated structures,
Figure S3).

(ii) The binding site hydrophobicity is here estimated in terms of hydrophobicity distribution across
the different conformational ensembles, calculated with TRAPP. The distribution of the MD
ensemble (based on the apo structure) can be fitted with a Gaussian centered around a
hydrophobicity ~55 on the TRAPP scale41 (Figure S6A). Similarly, the apo X-ray crystal structures
could be fitted with a Gaussian that is shifted to a peak at a higher hydrophobicity of ~65 (Figure
S6A). The distribution of the holo X-ray crystal structures exhibits three peaks: one at lower
hydrophobicity (~42-55), one at the apo X-ray crystal structures hydrophobicity (~60-70), and one
at high hydrophobicity (~80-90) (Figure S6A). The high hydrophobicity conformations include
complexes in which large ligands, with a molecular mass of 400 Da or greater, are covalently
bound to Cys145 (PDB IDs 6LU7, 7BUY, and 7C8R). The hydrophobicity distribution from
tConcoord can be fit with a more spread Gaussian spanning from low (~20) to high hydrophobicity
values. The hydrophobicity distribution of the LRIP conformations is instead bivariate and
overlaps with that of the MD ensemble. The observed trends for hydrophobicity computed with
SiteMap for the crystal structure and MSM ensembles are similar, see Section S3.

1.1. Druggability. Here, we analyze the druggability as defined by the CNN and LR scores from
TRAPP41 along with DScore/ SiteScore from SiteMap.43, 44 All pockets in the crystallographic
structures (except one, PDB ID 6WTK) are scored as druggable: their druggability indices are
above the scores’ thresholds for druggability (0.9, 0.9, 0.5, 0.8 for SiteMap, DScore, LR and CNN
models of TRAPP, respectively, Figure S6. These thresholds were taken from Halgren et al.44).
There is not, however, any notable correlation between the druggability scores from the
SiteScore/DScore and TRAPP methods. This is expected because the observed variations in the
druggability index is within the method prediction uncertainty. Despite the slightly lower
druggability indices in SiteScore and TRAPP-LR for the apo X-ray crystal structures compared to
the holo crystal structures, they are still predicted to be druggable within the uncertainty of the
methods. In contrast, about 50% of the simulated structures (MD, LRIP, and tConcoord) were
predicted not to be druggable (Figure S6).

35
36
37
38

The druggability scores of the simulated, and, more, of the X-ray crystal structures correlate with
binding site hydrophobicity (Figure S6, Section S3.3, and Table S4, S5). The correlation with other
binding site features is much smaller (see Table S4, S5). We conclude that, as expected, the
more hydrophobic the pocket is, the more druggable it is.

included a set consisting of 180 compounds with pIC50 against SARS-CoV Mpro greater than 6
reported in the literature (active molecules, hereafter). 12, 16, 45-67 Our sample library is chemically
very diverse as compared to the crystallographic ligands in complex with SARS-CoV-2 Mpro and
the active molecules (see Figure S7). A more detailed chemoinformatics analysis is reported in
Section S4.1-2.

We selected SARS-CoV-2 Mpro conformations with scores above the druggability thresholds.
These include all the X-ray crystal structures except 6WTK (42 structures), 10 MSM ensemble
conformations (MSM selection), and 8 representatives of the top 10% scoring conformations from
the MD10000 and LRIP/tC ensembles (see Table 1, Section S4.3, Table S6, Figure S8-9).

The ligands were screened against the conformations using OpenEye FRED 68 and Schrödinger
Suite Glide Version 85012.69, 70 We discuss here the results obtained with FRED. Those obtained
with Glide present similar trends and are reported in the Supporting Information (Section S4.4
and Figure S10). Also, we report here only the calculation results obtained with the
MD10000/LRIP/tC and X-Ray selections. The data obtained with the MSM selection are reported
in the SI (Section S4.5, Figure S11).

The quality of the virtual screenings was evaluated in terms of: (i) Enrichment Factor (EF) defined
as EF(1%) = ( #active molecules in the top 1% / #molecules in the top 1% ) / ( active molecules
in the whole set). (ii) Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC) curves, used to evaluate the true
positive rate and the area under the curve (AUC).

The structures from the MD10000/LRIP/tC and MSM selections, along with the apo X-ray
structures, exhibited a poor EF (below 5%), despite being identified as druggable by all the
druggability prediction methods here implemented (Figure 3). The poorer performance of the apo
X-ray crystal structures was expected since they exhibited overall lower druggability scores with
respect to the holo structures (Figure S6F). This was not the case with the selected structures
from the MD10000 and LRIP/tC ensembles (see Section S4.3), where only the 10% of the
structures with highest druggability scores were used for screening. This suggests that the
druggability prediction methods are not sensitive enough to distinguish between high- and lowEF conformations for the chemical space considered (see also discussion below). On the other
hand, for the holo X-ray crystal structures, both “well-performing” (EF > 15%) and “poorlyperforming” (EF < 5%) conformations were identified (Figure 3).

Next, we determined which of these ensembles exhibits a Protein-Ligand Interaction Fingerprint
(PLIF) comparable to the one established by the ligands co-crystallized with SARS-Cov2 Mpro.
In the PLIF of the latter (Figure 4A), we observe an overall predominance of Hbond interactions
over hydrophobic ones, with Cys145 (catalytic dyad), Gly143, Ser144, His163 and Glu166 as the
most attractive residues to form Hbond interactions (comparable occurrence) with the ligands.
The only exception is represented by His41 (catalytic dyad), which is similarly involved in Hbonds
and hydrophobic interactions.

The PLIF of the well-performing conformations (Figure 4B, upper panel) matches the one of the
crystallographic complexes well (Figure 4A). Namely, the same hot-spot (i.e. preferential residues
for ligand binding) residues emerge: the ligands form Hbonds with Cys145 (catalytic dyad),
Gly143, Ser144, Gly166, and His163, as well as hydrophobic interactions with His41 (catalytic
dyad). The main difference between the two PLIFs is in the lower occurrence of Hbonds involving
Gly143, Ser144 and Cys145 (catalytic dyad) than in the crystallographic complexes, and in the
higher occurrence of hydrophobic contacts with Thr25 and His41 (the second residue in the
catalytic dyad). This change in the surrounding of the reactive cysteine, Cys145 (Thr25, Gly143,
Ser144) might be due to the presence of several covalent ligands in the crystal structures.
Covalent binding might locally alter the PLIF, and this effect is not considered in the virtual
screening.

In all the other selections (i.e. poorly-performing X-ray structures Figure 4B lower panel, MD10000
and LRIP/tC selection Figure 4C, and MSM selection Figure S11), the key Hbonds above
discussed have an occurrence that is markedly lower than non-specific hydrophobic interactions.
Also the latter interactions substantially decrease, including those with His41 (catalytic dyad).
Moreover, in the MSM, MD10000 and LRIP/tC selections, ligands interact with almost all residues
of the binding site (Figure 4C and Figure S11), but with an occurrence below 25% (for each
interaction type) and with a strong predominance of hydrophobic interactions versus HBonds.
This points to a rather non-specific binding of the screened molecules in the MD/MSM-selected
structures.

Summarizing, we found that our evaluation of the virtual screening procedure correctly identifies
the conformations able to provide the most similar PLIF to the known crystallized ligands of SARSCoV2 Mpro.

To rationalize why the binding site structural determinants cause such dramatic differences in the
PLIF of crystal structures (i.e. poorly/well-performing), MSM, MD10000 and LRIP/tC selections,
we compared the average binding site shapes for the different selections. We found that the
residues in the MSM, MD10000 and LRIP /tC selections are distributed over a larger volume than
in the crystal structures (Figure 4D-F); therefore, the spatial location of the hotspots (i.e. HBond
donors/acceptors, hydrophobic patches, charges) is significantly different. MSM, MD10000 and
LRIP/tC selections were composed of structures with high druggability scores (see Section S3.3),
suggesting that the druggability scores are, in this case, unable to identify the binding site features
responsible for good performances (defined here as EF and AUC, see above) in virtual screening.
Even re-selecting the conformations from the MD-ensembles using the similarity with respect to
well-performing structures as criterion (i.e. Root Mean Square Deviation, RMSD), did not provide
a satisfying performance (Section S5, Figure S12), indicating that key features for obtaining high
enrichment factors in the virtual screening, i.e. the precise placement of interacting residues, are
missing.

Let us now compare the average binding site shape of the well- versus the poorly-performing
crystal structures: two adjacent cavities can be observed on the well-performing structures (Figure
4D): one including Glu166, Pro168, Gln189, Thr190 and Gln192, that is missing in the poorlyperforming structures (Figure 4E); the other including Thr25 Leu27, His41, Asn142, Cys145,
Met165, Glu166 and Gln189 that is also present in the poorly-performing structure, but wider and
less deep than in well-performing ones. Therefore, interactions with Pro168 only appear in the
well-performing structures, and the occurrence of Gln189 is much higher in well-performing than
in poorly-performing ones. Notably, the binding site shape of the poorly-performing structures
shares strong similarities with that of the apo structures (Figure 4G).

This difference in binding site shape is a consequence of the fact that in the well-performing
structures, the small helix near P2 group (residues 46–50) and the β-hairpin loop near P3–P4
substituents (residues 166–170) shift about 2.7 Å apart with respect to the poorly-performing
ones, whereas the P5 loop (residues 190–194) moves closer to the P3–P4 loop. Also, two
methionines, Met49 and Met165, change their side-chain orientation impacting the side chain
positions of the overall P2 loop, as well as the exposure of His163 (Figure 4H); the interaction
with the latter significantly decreases in the poorly-performing structures, as already discussed
above. These differences are similar to those observed between the well-performing and the apo
structures (Figure S13).

Taken together, these results may explain why the druggability indices are unable to distinguish
the binding site features linked to a good performance in virtual screening: very subtle variations
of the conformations of the binding site residues induced upon binding, and therefore not present
in the structural ensembles generated in the absence of a ligand, can lead to significant
differences in the EF. These subtle variations are very challenging to discriminate in terms of
druggability indices.

To identify the relevant ligand features that might relate to high affinity binding, we extract here
the consensus chemical space, defined by the common ligands across the top 1% of the wellperforming structures in the virtual screening. These are 32 molecules, 16 of which belong to the
“active” molecules in our library (“consensus active” hereafter, Figure S14 and Table 1). We next
calculated the corresponding pharmacophore (i.e. an ensemble of steric and electronic features
that is necessary to ensure the optimal supramolecular interactions with a specific biologic target)
and linearly combined it with the X-ray pharmacophore. This is done to consider possible
additional features coming from covalent binding that cannot be covered by the virtual screening
protocol. The consensus pharmacophore combined with the X-ray pharmacophore constitutes
the “active-pharmacophore”, hereafter (see Methods, Figure 5).

Next, we tested the predictive power of our active-pharmacophore in discriminating the higher
affinity binders across all the so-far known SARS-CoV-2 Mpro inhibitors: these are 46 molecules
coming from the papers published until November 20 th 2020, which were not included in our
sample library and that display a measured affinity spanning from 30 nM to 125 µM 17, 31, 71-77).
Some of these molecules were excluded by the docking software due to their excessive size or
due to the presence of metals (e.g. candesartan cilexetil, Evans blue, phenylmercuric acetate).

For this purpose, we calculated the Dice coefficient, which measures the number of features in
common between the molecule and the active-pharmacophore, relative to the average number of
features present.78 When scoring the 46 known SARS-CoV-2 Mpro binders according to the Dice
coefficient, the highest scored molecules were 11a, 11b, 11r, UAWJ246, UAWJ247, UAWJ248
and CG373 (see Figure S15), which are also the highest affinity (IC50 ≤ 400 nM) SARS-CoV-2
Mpro binders (nM-binders, hereafter). On the other hand, it is not possible to discriminate the subµM-binders of SARS-CoV-2 Mpro (400 nM < IC50 ≤ 1000 nM) from the µM ones (IC50 > 1000
nM) (see Figure S16). Of course, these results have to be taken with care given the fact we are
comparing assay-dependent IC50 values coming from different labs. Also, several of these
inhibitors are predicted to be covalent binders and, therefore, their IC50 values can be
controversial (see the discussion offered in the Limitation paragraph). Therefore, in the next
section, we analyzed the chemical space shaped by the well-performing conformations upon
ligand binding, and offer a rationale for the predictive power of our active-pharmacophore in
identifying nM-binders of SARS-CoV-2 Mpro.

3.1. Rationalization of the active-pharmacophore and SARS-CoV to -CoV-2 Mpro ligands'
transferability. The PLIF of the consensus chemical space is dominated by the “consensus
active” ones (the latter PLIF is almost identical to the former one, Figure S17A) and it shows a
predominance of HBond interactions with His163, Glu166, Gly189 and Cys145 (Figure 5A), as

well as hydrophobic interactions with Thr25, His41, Met165, Pro168 and Gln189. Accordingly, the
same trends can be seen for the PLIF of the SARS-CoV-2 Mpro nM-binders (Figure 5B), the only
differences being (i) the additional high occurrence of Gly143 and Ser144 Hbonds (as already
observed in the PLIF of the X-Ray structures), and (ii) the lower occurrence of hydrophobic
interactions with Thr25.

When comparing the binding poses of the “consensus active” molecules and the nM-binders of
SARS-CoV-2 Mpro (Section S6), we found indeed that: the indole group (in 11a, 11b and 7 of the
16 molecules of the “consensus active” set) or the benzyl group (in GC373, 11r and 6 of the 16
molecules of the “consensus active” set), or the benzimidazole group (in 1 of the 16 of the
“consensus active” set) is buried in the upper sub-cavity defined by residues Glu166, Pro168,
Gln182, Gln189 and Thr190 (Figure 5E-F). Notably, this cavity was shrunk in the poorlyperforming structures, further validating the quality of our model that correctly excluded the
conformations potentially incompatible with nM-binders. The benzothiazole moiety of the
“consensus active” is instead located in the lower part of the binding cavity defined by Thr24,
Thr25 and Thr26. This benzothiazole moiety is absent in the SARS-CoV-2 Mpro nM-binders,
possibly explaining the lower occurrence of hydrophobic interactions with Thr25.

This suggests that the binding to the lower part of the binding site (Thr24, Thr25, Thr26) is not a
relevant feature for the nM affinity of SARS-CoV-2 ligands. In contrast, the high occurrence of
Gly143 and Ser144 Hbonds appears to be a signature of nM-binders of SARS-CoV-2 Mpro, also
found in the PLIF of the known X-ray ligands of SARS CoV-2 complexes. Notably, the formation
of these two Hbonds appear to be significantly hampered in the “consensus active” set due to the
presence of the above-mentioned benzothiazole moiety, that seems to compromise the
juxtaposition of the Hbond acceptors of the ligands. Accordingly, none of the SARS-CoV-2 nMbinders, display benzothiazole or analogous bulky aromatic groups in such a position (Figure
S14).

Analysis of all the 166 holo SARS-CoV-2 Mpro crystal structures also showed that the majority
of their ligands do not have a benzothiazole or analogous bulky aromatic groups in the Thr24,
Thr25, Thr26 subpocket (Figure S18). The two exceptions are PDB IDs 7JKV and 6XR3, where
the ligands are covalently bound and the bulky group appear twisted in the cavity in a different
position with respect the predicted the other X-rays and docking poses: this is possibly due to
ligand-dependent conformational rearrangement upon covalent bond formation with Cys145.
Concerning the µM binders known so-far, only very few of them are predicted to have a bulky
group in such a position (Figure S16). In other words, our results suggest that the bottom part of
the binding cavity in SARS-CoV-2 Mpro should only host small aromatic/hydrophobic moieties (or
nothing at all) to facilitate the formation of Gly143 and Ser144 Hbonds, the latter being a signature
of the currently known nM-binders to SARS-CoV-2 Mpro.

Recently, the X-ray structure of GC373 in complex with SARS-CoV-2 Mpro was solved (PDB ID:
7BRR, recently superseded by PDB ID 7D1M (released on October 28 th 2020). The ligand in the
crystal structure appears in two different conformations, one resembling the predicted pose from
us, where the benzyl group of GC373 is not buried in the upper sub-cavity defined by residues
Glu166, Pro168, Gln182, Gln189 and Thr190; The other where this benzyl group it is exposed
toward the solvent. Yet, when the crystallographic complex undergoes 500 ns of MD simulations,
the pose where the aromatic ring is exposed toward the solvent rearranges as in the predicted
docking pose (see Section S7 and Figure S19). Such results further validate our activepharmacophore.

We next calculated the PLIFs of both the sub-µM (Figure S17B) and µM inhibitors (Figure 5C) of
SARS-CoV-2 Mpro, which we were unable to discriminate with our active-pharmacophore. We
found that indeed the two PLIFs are very similar and they both feature a drastic decrease of the
occurrence of all the key HBonds found by the nM-binders of SARS-CoV-2 Mpro. The sub-µM
and µM PLIFs turn out to resemble the PLIF of the “active” molecules that were not in our
consensus group (i.e. nM-binders for SARS-CoV Mpro predicted to be low affinity binders for
SARS-CoV-2 Mpro, Figure S20A, Section S8). Indeed, the “active” molecules excluded by our
consensus present differences that may hamper a positive scoring and, possibly, a successful
binding to the receptor, like an excessively long peptidic chain (i.e. Figure S20, molecules a and
d), bulky substituents (i.e. Figure S20, molecules a and b) or a five membered ring rarely observed
in Mpro inhibitors (i.e. Figure 20, molecule c).

This suggests that our active-pharmacophore is not only able to discriminate the nM-binders of
SARS-CoV-2 Mpro (IC50 ≤ 400 nM) from the rest, but it also identifies key specific transferable
and not-transferable binding features of nM SARS-CoV Mpro binders to SARS-CoV-2 Mpro ones.
Taken together, these results suggest that our active-pharmacophore is a fair representation of
the SARS-CoV-2 Mpro blueprint in the chemical space. Namely, it correctly represents a set of

binding features compatible with the induced SARS-CoV-2 conformational space of the binding
site. The latter is in part determined by the ligand upon binding and in part it depends on the
residues differing in SARS-CoV-2 Mpro with respect to SARS-CoV Mpro, as also shown in
Bzówka et al.18

We considered a set of publicly available compounds within the E4C network, 79 from the EUOPENSCREEN Bioactive CompoundLibrary,80 coming from the PROBE MINER repository.79, 81
The set was re-scored based on the Dice similarity of their docked pose to our activepharmacophore (see Methods). Benserazide (EOS100736) and Myricetin (EOS100814)
compounds (see schemes in Figure 6A, B) were predicted as nM-binders of SARS-CoV-2 Mpro
candidates. SARS-CoV-2 Mpro biochemical assays performed here established the accuracy of
our predictions by measuring IC50 values as low as 140 nM and 220 nM, respectively (see
Section S9, Figure S21).

The docking pose of Myricetin, as coming out from our virtual screening procedure, shows an
orientation which is comparable to the one observed in the newly solved X-ray structure with PDB
ID 7B3E (resolution 1.77 Å, see Figure 6C). In this pose, the bicyclic ring in the two structures
nicely overlap, while the 3,4,5-trihydroxyphenyl moiety is rotated in our predicted pose with
respect to the crystallographic one. By refining the docking pose (see Section S9.1 and Figure
6C) both the bicyclic ring and the 3,4,5-trihydroxyphenyl moiety assumes an orientation nearly
identical to the one found in the X-ray pose after covalent binding with Cys145, with an overall
RMSD of 0.46 Å between the refined predicted pose and the crystallographic one. Interestingly,
Baicalin features the same isoflavon scaffold as Myricetin, yet it binds the protein with a different
orientation, as shown by X-ray studies (PDB ID 6M2N). Our procedure predicted such orientation,
although the overall binding pose differed more significantly from the X-ray one than that with of
Myriecitin (see Section S9.2, Figure S22).

Myricetin and Benserazide contain polyhydroxy-phenolic moieties, which are considered
promiscuous due to their redox features but also to the presence of a high number of close Hbond
acceptor/donor sites that allow them to satisfy several 3D-pharmacophores. Nonetheless, these
compounds have, respectively, reached approved clinical usage (i.e. for Parkinson's disease82
and alcohol use disorder83) and are in use in our diet like other polyhydroxyphenol-containing
products.84 Also, Quercetin, structurally similar to Myricetin, was identified mild inhibitor of SARSCoV-2 Mpro (KI ~ 7 μM).85

SARS-CoV-2 Mpro is an important target for COVID-19 drug discovery because of its key role for
viral replication and low similarity with human proteases.6, 7 Given its conserved nature with
respect to the other Mpros across Coronaviruses and the presence of a huge number of
crystallized structures (apo and holo), several drug repurposing and structure-based drug design
campaigns have been conducted.20-29 Unfortunately, this has so far led to only 7 SARS-CoV-2
Mpro inhibitors in the nM range (IC50 ≤ 400 nM). This contrasts with SARS-CoV Mpro, for which
127 nM inhibitors are known in this range.46, 47, 52, 54, 56, 60-62, 65 The observed difficulties in identifying
potent SARS-CoV-2 Mpro inhibitors was suggested to arise from the large plasticity of the binding
site,18 along with other factors (also observed for SARS-CoV Mpro), including induced-fit
conformational changes and formation of covalent bonds upon ligand binding 30. Therefore, the
available binding space can differ significantly from ligand to ligand.

Accounting for receptor binding site flexibility in molecular docking is a significant challenge. This
can be partially overcome with a careful choice of the most appropriate receptor and reference
ligand(s) or by performing ensemble docking approaches. 86, 87 While it seems logical to employ
multiple protein structures and ligands where available, very few published studies have
systematically evaluated the impact of using additional information on proteins and ligands'
structure.88 These studies arrive at the conclusion that alternative structure-based design
approach may be to define pharmacophores based on the binding site and use them to search
large chemical databases.89, 90

Our paper exploits the particularly large amount of structural information available for Mpro (~200
X-ray structures in the apo and in the holo forms), along with a very long MD simulation from the
D. E. Shaw group37 and structures generated here by enhanced sampling of the binding site

dynamics. First, we have determined the potential druggability of each of the ~30,000 Mpro
conformations generated from these sources, as calculated using TRAPP and SiteMap
druggability tools.38, 42, 43 Next, we have used a sample library to understand how selected
potential high-druggable protein conformations perform when probed with a diverse chemical
space, here defined by 13,000 compounds (see t-SNE plot in Figure 7, and methods for details).

Our library included also “active” molecules, i.e. molecules that are known to bind with nM affinity
(pIC50 > 6) to SARS-CoV Mpro. Therefore, virtual screenings against ~200 protein conformations
were performed. We found that only a few of these highly-druggable (“well-performing”)
conformations recognize a sufficiently high percentage of such “active” molecules: The ones in
common among across the well-performing structure, “consensus active” molecules (16 in total)
represent a small subgroup of the overall “active” molecules’ ensemble with specific features. In
particular, the “consensus active” (16 molecules) are mostly clustered in two main areas of the tSNE plot, both corresponding to peptidomimetic structures but differing from each other by the
presence of a benzothiazole moiety and an additional peptide bond. The specific protein-ligand
interaction fingerprint (PLIF) of the “consensus active” molecules strikingly resembles the one
emerging from the SARS-CoV-2 Mpro co-crystalized ligands. The latter indeed cluster in the same
region of the t-SNE plot. Notably, no consensus was found for the poorly-performing structures.

We then combined the crystallographic and the virtual screening PLIFs (i.e. the chemical space
emerging from experimental structures and the chemical space selected upon virtual screening).
Within the limitations of the procedure (discussed in the Limitation paragraph), we obtained an
“active-pharmacophore” that we first used against a selection of SARS-CoV-2 Mpro binders (46
molecules): the latter are very diverse and they are spread overall the t-SNE plot (Figure 7). The
active-pharmacophore could predict known nM-binders for SARS-CoV-2 Mpro (12 molecules out
of the total of 46), which are also clustered in the peptides and peptidomimetics region of the tSNE plot, and discriminate these from the µM ones. Moreover, it could also discriminate the
transferable from the non-transferable binding features from SARS-CoV to SARS-CoV-2 Mpro.

The former include the interaction with the catalytic dyad residues along with: (i) His163, whose
mutation to Ala inactivates SARS-CoV Mpro,91 (ii) Glu166, which plays a role in the dimerization
(required for enzymatic activity) in SARS-CoV.92 In addition, its interactions with the N-finger of
the other subunit assist the correct orientation of residues in the binding pocket for both proteins, 92,
93
(iii) Gln189, which correlates evolutionally with residues from the Cys44-Pro52 loop in both
proteins, which was shown to regulate ligand entrance to the binding site 18 in both proteins, and
(iv) Ser144, whose mutation to Ala hampers the catalytic activity in SARS-Cov MPro.94

The non-transferable binding features include the ability to place large hydrophobic/aromatic
groups in the part of the cavity defined by Thr25 and Thr26 that is partially lost in SARS-CoV-2
Mpro compared to SARS-CoV Mpro. This appears to affect HBonds with Gly143 and Ser144.
Accordingly, this cavity is empty or occupied by a smaller aromatic group like a benzyl ring in all
the known nM-binders and the co-crystallized ligands of SARS-CoV-2 Mpro. In contrast, several
of the known nM-binders of SARS-CoV Mpro have benzothiazole or analogous bulky aromatic
groups in this position.

We finally used our active-pharmacophore against a public library of compounds. We predicted
two ligands to be nM for SARS-CoV-2: Benserazide and Myricetin. Biochemical assay
experiments confirmed them to be nM binders of SARS-CoV-2 (Figure S21). Our predicted pose

of Myricetin is in very good agreement with the just solved X-structure of the complex (Figure 6C).
This was not expected since Baicalin baring the same isoflavon scaffold of Myricitin binds in a
reversed position (PDB ID 6M2N). Thus, the pharmacophore not only successfully predicts poses
in a highly flexible binding site as that of SARS-CoV-2 Mpro, but it also discriminates between
different orientations of quite similar scaffolds.

the co-crystalized ligands are shown in red, with selected ligands shown in 2D representation on the side (labeled e-g). The
inset with a magnified portion of the t-SNE plot is reported at the bottom of the figure. The “active” molecules appear to be
more chemically diverse than the SARS CoV-2 Mpro co-crystallized ligands since they are spread over all the t-SNE plot,
while the co-crystallized ligands mostly cluster in the bottom part of the plot. This region corresponds to peptides covalently
bound to SARS-CoV-2 Mpro-C145 (PDB ids: 6LU7, 6LZE, 6M0K, 6WTJ, 6WTK, 6WTT, 6XA4, 6XBH, 6XBG, 6XBI, 6Y2F,

This work was carried out within the framework of EXSCALATE4CORONAVIRUS (E4C) 79 project.
E4C aims to exploit the most powerful computing resources currently based in Europe to
empower smart in silico drug design applied to the 2019-2020 SARS-CoV-2 coronavirus
pandemic, while increasing the accuracy and predictability of Computer-Aided Drug Design
(CADD). We here used 400,000 core-hours on the JURECA supercomputer in the Jülich
Supercomputing Centre. Advanced CADD in combination with high throughput biochemical and
phenotypic screening are allowing the rapid evaluation of simulation results and the reduction of
time for the discovery of new drugs.96 The work presented here indeed shows how a
computational procedure combined with experimental validation can correctly predict structure
and affinity trends of effective hit molecules for a given target. This kind of combined approaches
may be a key strategy especially against pandemic viruses and other pathogens, where the
immediate identification of effective treatments is of paramount importance.

Our methodological approach also demonstrates that only a small fraction of the binding sites of
the apo protein from crystal structures or simulations are similar to those of the well-performing
holo structures. However, even the conformations with high structural similarity and high
druggability scores, generated by molecular dynamics simulations, yielded low enrichment factors
in virtual screening. Thus, druggability assessment methods fail to discriminate between small
structural variations of the binding site that lead to successful performance in virtual screening.
These small structural differences significantly impact ligand binding predictions as observed in
our virtual screening campaigns. They could also be a source of disappointing results in other
virtual screening campaigns carried out so far by research groups world-wide.22, 28, 32, 33, 95 These
observations indicate that there is space to improve the discriminatory ability of druggability
scores by training on a wider range of structures generated by simulation as well as
crystallography. Moreover, they highlight the need to develop simulation methods to generate
holo-like protein structures for virtual screening.

Expression and enzymatic activity. SARS-CoV-2 Mpro (ORF1ab polyprotein residues 32643569, GenBank code: MN908947.3) has been produced, purified and used as described in Zhang
et al.17 The detection of enzymatic activity of the SARS-COV-2 3CL-Pro was performed under
conditions similar to those reported by Zhang et al.17 Enzymatic activity was measured by a
Förster resonance energy transfer (FRET), using the dual-labelled substrate, DABCYLKTSAVLQ↓SGFRKM-EDANS (Bachem #4045664) containing a protease specific cleavage site
after the Gln. In the intact peptide, EDANS fluorescence is quenched by the DABCYL group.
Following enzymatic cleavage, generation of the fluorescent product was monitored (Ex 340 nm,
Em 460 nm), (EnVision, Perkin Elmer). The assay buffer contained 20 mM Tris (pH 7.3), 100 mM
NaCl and 1 mM EDTA. The assay was established in an automated screening format (384 well
black microplates, Corning, #3820)

Primary screen and dose response. In the primary screen, test compounds (stock at 10 mM in
100 % DMSO), positive (Zinc-Pyrithione [medchemexpress, Cat. No.: HY-B0572] 10 mM in 100
% DMSO) and negative (100 % DMSO) controls, were transferred to 384-well assay microplates
by acoustic dispensing (Echo, Labcyte). Plate locations were: test compounds at 20µM final
(columns 1 to 22); positive control Zinc-Pyrithione at 10 µM final (column 23); and negative control
0.2 % v/v (column 24). 5 µl of SARS-CoV-2 Mpro stock (120 nM) in assay buffer were added to
each plate well and incubated with the compounds for 60 min at 37 °C. After addition of 5 µl
substrate (30 µM in assay buffer), the final concentrations were: 15 µM substrate, 60 nM SARSCoV-2 Mpro, 20 µM compound, and 0.2% DMSO, in a total volume of 10 µL/well. The
fluorescence signal was then measured at 15 min and inhibition (%) calculated relative to controls.
To flag possible optical interference effects fluorescence was also measured 60 min after
substrate addition, when the enzymatic reaction was complete. Results were normalized to the
100 % and 0 % inhibition controls.

concentration responses, starting from 20 µM top concentration with 1:2 dilution steps. To flag
optical and non-specific interference effects, a counter screen was performed during hit profiling
with the assay protocol adjusted so that compound addition occurred at 60 min post substrate
addition, when the enzymatic reaction was complete.

Markov State Modeling. Kinetically distinct states were identified from the 100 𝜇s simulation37
from D. E. Shaw Research through Markov state modeling. Two alternative Markov state models
were created with two different sets of input features 1) with Cartesian coordinates of all alpha
carbons in the dimer and 2) 10,668 distances in the range 0.5 to 1.3 nm spread across the whole
dimer. Further dimensionality reduction was done with time-lagged independent component
analysis (tICA)97, 98 in five dimensions and with a lag time of 10 ns. The obtained 5-dimensional
space was further discretized into 50 distinct states through k-means clustering, which were used
to construct Markov state models with lag time 10 ns. Perron cluster-cluster analysis, PCCA++,
was finally used to obtain 1) three and 2) four kinetically distinct macrostates. Markov state
modeling was done with the software PyEMMA99 and visualizations with VMD.100

Druggability analysis of Sars-CoV2 main protease structure. The SiteMap tool,101 together
with the TRAPP (TRAnsient Pockets in Proteins) approach42 were used for the characterization
of the proteins’ binding sites. The SiteScore is based on a weighted sum of several properties
accounting for the degree of pocket enclosure (a surrogate for pocket curvature), pocket size, and
the balance between hydrophobic and hydrophilic character in the binding site. The Dscore uses
almost the same properties as SiteScore but different coefficients are used and hydrophilicity is
not considered. TRAPP provides tools for (i) the exploration of binding pocket flexibility and (ii)
the estimation of druggability variation in an ensemble of protein structures. 42 Specifically, two
methods were applied: Langevin Rotationally Induced Perturbation (LRIP) 39 and tConcoord102 to
generate conformational ensembles that explore the flexibility of the Mpro binding pocket.
Subsequently, the binding pocket’s druggability in each of the generated protein conformations

Generation of binding pocket conformational ensembles using LRIP and tConcoord. We
based the conformational ensemble generation on the high-resolution X-ray crystal structures
with PDB IDs 6LU7 (2.16 Å resolution103) and 6Y2G (2.20 Å resolution17). All 306 residues of
SARS-CoV-2 Mpro are resolved in PDB ID 6LU7; for PDB ID 6Y2G, the unresolved C-terminal
residues (see Table S1) were modeled using PyMol. 104 All TRAPP analysis was conducted on
homodimeric structures, generated with the symmetry wizard of PyMol. 104 All heteroatom records
were removed from the protein structures and hydrogen atoms were added at a pH of 7.4 using
the CHARMM force field105 and pdb2pqr.106 The structure of the covalent ligand (N3), needed to
define the binding pocket in TRAPP, was obtained from the PDB ID 6LU7 and, in the case of
6Y2G, positioned in the binding pocket by alignment of 6LU7 to 6Y2G using PyMol 104. For both
crystal structures, 6LU7 and 6Y2G, 200 energy minimized conformations were generated with
tConcoord102 using TRAPP4. Additionally, ensembles were generated with LRIP39 at 300 K,
generating 100 conformations for each pocket lining residue. For 6LU7, 100 perturbations were
made, each followed by 100 MD steps for relaxation. For 6Y2G, 300 perturbations were made,
each followed by 300 MD steps for relaxation. The parameters for 6Y2G were chosen to increase
conformational sampling and improve sampling statistics.

Druggability calculation. The active site pocket of SARS-CoV-2 Mpro was defined with TRAPP4
by assigning a distance of 3.5 Å around all atoms of the ligand N3 from PDB ID 6LU7. This
distance was used to detect residues that potentially may contribute to the binding site and to
define dimensions of a 3D grid that was then used to compute the binding pocket shape. Then
the binding pocket for each structure was mapped on the 3D grid. The druggability score of this
pocket was computed using linear regression (LR) or a convolutional neural network (CNN) and
scaled between 0 and 1.41 Scores were calculated for all conformations generated for 6LU7 and
6Y2G from LRIP and tConcoord, as well as for frames collected every 10 ns from the conventional
MD simulations.37 For each structure, a set of the binding site residues that line the binding pocket
was detected using the procedure implemented in the TRAPP package. Specifically, each residue
was characterized by the number of atoms that contact with the binding pocket.

Structure Selection: First we selected all structures (generated by tConcoord, LRIP, or extracted
from MD trajectories) with the top 10% of the LR and CNN druggability score. These structures
were then clustered by the binding site similarity into 8 clusters using k-means procedure (see
Figure S8 and also Section S4.3 for more details).

sources, literature, the Clarivate Analytics Integrity database, the GOSTAR database and the data
repository shared by the Global Health Drug Discovery Institute, were added. A final unique list
of about 13,500 drugs were obtained. All compounds 46, 47, 52, 54, 56, 60-62, 65 were converted from 2D
to 3D and prepared with Schrödinger’s LigPrep tool.107 This process generates multiple sets of
coordinates for different stereoisomers, tautomers, ring conformations (1 stable ring conformer by
default) and protonation states. The Schrödinger Epik software 108, 109 was used to assign
tautomers and protonation states that would be more populated at the selected pH range (pH = 7
± 1). Ambiguous chiral centers were enumerated, allowing a maximum of 32 isomers to be
produced for each input compound. OPLS3 parameters were generated for each ligand. Multiple
conformations for each compound were generated and a 1,000 step torsional sampling was
performed. The conformers were retained if the minimized energy of the conformer is within 50
kJ/mol of the global minimum.110 After preparation, this resulted in 23,000 coordinate files for
different conformers, tautomers and protomers of the compounds in the library.

Glide Docking. The protein was preprocessed with the Protein Preparation Wizard from the
Schrödinger Suite version 2019-4 with the default parameters.108, 109, 111, 112 The protonation states
of each side chain were generated using Epik for pH = 7 ± 2. 108, 109 All water molecules were
removed. Energy minimization was performed using the OPLS3 force field. 110, 113 Glide Version
8501269, 70 was used for all docking calculations. Docking of the compounds, prepared as
described above, was performed to both active sites of the homodimer. The grids for the docking
were prepared using the default parameters, with the internal grid box centered on the centroid
of the co-crystallized ligand, when available. The external grid box was defined by checking the
option “Dock ligands similar in size” (~32 x ~32 x ~32 Å). The internal grid box guides the docking
algorithm to the region of interest, while the external grid box allows greater flexibility in ligand
size and orientation. The Glu166 (backbone nitrogen bound hydrogen atom as well as the
backbone oxygen atom), His163 (sidechain NE2 bound hydrogen atom) and His164 (sidechain
oxygen atom) were defined as possible Hbond constraints. A standard precision (SP) Glide
docking was carried out, generating 20 poses per docked molecule; During the docking
procedure, poses were rejected, if they were not able to fulfill at least 2 of the Hbond constraints
defined above. Glide score version 5.0114 was used to rank the binding poses. This is an empirical
scoring function designed to reproduce trends in the binding affinity.

FRED Docking. The SARS-CoV-2 Mpro receptors were generated by OpenEye
Spruce4Docking,68, 115, 116 using as input the structures pre-processed by the Protein Preparation
Wizard and Epik in the Schrödinger Suite. The protonation state of the receptor was not altered.
The OpenEye Docking suite performs rigid docking of pre-generated conformers. Here, these
conformers were generated from the prepared library (see above) using OpenEye OMEGA.117
Conformers with internal clashes and duplicates were discarded by the software and the
remaining ones were clustered on the basis of the root mean square deviation (RMSD). For virtual
screening, a maximum of 200 conformers per compound, clustered with a RMSD of 0.5 Å, was
used. If the number of conformers generated exceeded the specified maximum, only the ones
with the lowest energies were retained. Rigid-body docking was performed using OpenEye
FRED,68, 115, 116 which is included in the OEDocking 3.4.0.2 suite.68, 115, 116 Each conformer was
docked by FRED in the negative image of the active site of the target protein, which consists of a
shape potential field in the binding site volume. The highest values in this field represent points

where molecules can have a high number of contacts, without clashing into the protein structure.
In its exhaustive search, FRED translates and rotates the structure of each conformer within the
negative image of the active site, scoring each pose. The first step has a default translational and
rotational resolution of 1.0 and 1.5 Å, respectively. The 100 best scoring poses were then
optimized with translational and rotational single steps of 0.5 and 0.75 Å, respectively, exploring
all the 729 (six degrees of freedom with three positions = 36) nearby poses. The best scoring
pose was retained and assigned to the compound. The binding poses were evaluated by using
the Chemgauss4 scoring function implemented in OpenEye. 68, 115, 116

PLIF generation and representation. For the generation of the Protein Ligand Interaction
Fingerprints (PLIF) the Open Drug Discovery Toolkit (ODDT) package was implemented in an inhouse python script.121 Each PLIF represents a group of docked or co-crystallized molecules
saved as a series of binary fingerprints, each one representing the interaction of the molecule
itself with the receptor residues. For each residue of the receptor, 8 bits are used to describe the
presence or absence of different types of interaction (hydrophobic, aromatic face-to-face,
aromatic edge-to-edge, Hbond acceptors and donors, and ionic interactions) with the ligand. The
active-pharmacophore was derived by the average of the fingerprint of the “active” molecules in
the consensus, docked on the well-performing structures, with the fingerprint of the co-crystallized
ligands in the X-ray structures considered in this work. The resulting vector components were
then rounded according to a cutoff in order to form a bit vector representation. The most suitable
cutoff value was derived by iterating cutoff values between 0.1 and 0.9 and calculating the Dice
similarity index between the resulting bit vector and the PLIF generated by the docking poses of
the known SARS-CoV-2 Mpro binders. The cutoff, which would result in the highest dice similarity
when compared to the nanomolar affinity ligands was chosen. The molecules used for generation
of the crystal structure consensus fingerprint slightly overlap (7 out of 36 crystal ligand
conformations) with the sub-µM affinity ligands that are scored with the dice coefficient. When
removing these from the query, the pharmacophore is still able to locate the higher affinity ligands
in the top positions. The same Dice was screened against a selected number of EUOPENSCREEN ERIC Bioactive Compound Library. The PLIF representation in the form of
stacked histograms used in this work was generated using python matplotlib library (v 3.3.1). 122
In the histograms, each interaction is represented by a bar, whose height is proportional to the
number of times the interaction was observed among the group of molecules, divided by the
number of molecules. Bars representing different types of interactions with the same residue are
stacked onto each other, to visualize more easily the most important residues.

T-SNE plot. T-Distributed Stochastic Neighbor Embedding (t-SNE) plot. Embedding is based on
the 2048-bit Morgan118 fingerprint with a radius of 3. Scikit-learn t-SNE implementation with a
custom Tanimoto distance metric was used (see supporting information) in an in-house python
script. This algorithm performs a nonlinear dimensionality reduction technique that models each
high-dimensional object, i.e. a molecule in this case, by a two-dimensional point, in such a way
that similar objects (i.e. similar molecules) are modeled by nearby points and dissimilar objects
are modeled by distant points.

Limitations. As with any modelling study, our models also have limitations. Protein mobility is
most probably increased by the presence of moving and displaceable water molecule 123. In the
molecular screenings, individual water molecules, which may be critical in the binding process,
were not accounted for. Solvation effects can account for up to 100-fold difference in binding
affinity (corresponding to ~3 kcal/mol in binding free energy 124). Also, we in part rely on scoring
functions to rank and select the best binding poses. Current docking/scoring methods 124, 125 were
suggested to provide reasonable predictions of ligand binding modes, but their performance is
often disappointing in predicting ligand binding affinities. Additionally, those methods are often
system-dependent, making it very hard to decide which scoring function is suitable for the chosen
target protein. To partially overcome this issue, we carefully set-up Glide and Fred docking
procedure by reproducing a set of covalent and non-covalent SARS-CoV-2 Mpro-ligand crystal
poses.

Moreover, we compare assay-dependent IC50 data coming from different laboratories. In
addition, several of the known Mpros inhibitors are covalently bound to the protein. Irreversible
(covalent) enzyme inhibitors cannot be unambiguously ranked for biochemical potency by using
IC50 values, because the same IC50 value could originate either from relatively low initial binding
affinity accompanied by high chemical reactivity, or the other way around 126. In other words, the
important quantity to be considered would be the rate of covalent modification, (k inact/KI), that
describe the efficiency of covalent bond formation resulting from the potency (KI) of the first
reversible binding event and the maximum potential rate (k inact) of inactivation.127 This information
is unfortunately not available for most of the ligands here considered.
