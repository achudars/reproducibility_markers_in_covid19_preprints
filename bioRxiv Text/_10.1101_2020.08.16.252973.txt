SARS-CoV-2 ORF9b Targets Multiple Antiviral Pathways to Inhibit IFNs
1

Abstract

2

Severe acute respiratory syndrome corona-virus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), the

3

etiologic agent of the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), has a

4

catastrophic effect on human health and society. Clinical findings indicated that

5

the suppression of innate antiviral immunity, especially the type I and III

6

interferon (IFN) production, contributes to the pathogenesis of COVID-19.

7

However, how SARS-CoV-2 evades antiviral immunity still needs further

8

investigations. Here, we reported that the open reading frame 9b (ORF9b)

9

protein encoded by the SARS-CoV-2 genome inhibits the activation of type I

10

and III IFN response by targeting multiple molecules of innate antiviral

11

signaling pathways. SARS-CoV-2 ORF9b impaired the induction of type I and

12

III IFNs by Sendai virus or the dsRNA mimic poly (I:C). SARS-CoV-2 ORF9b

13

inhibits the activation of type I and III IFNs induced by the components of

14

cytosolic dsRNA-sensing pathways of RIG-I/MDA5-MAVS signaling, including

15

RIG-I, MDA-5, MAVS, TBK1, and IKKε rather than IRF3-5D, the active form of

16

IRF3. SARS-CoV-2 ORF9b also suppressed the induction of type I and III IFNs

17

by TRIF and STING, the adaptor protein of endosome RNA-sensing pathway

18

of TLR3-TRIF signaling and the adaptor protein of cytosolic DNA-sensing

19

pathway of cGAS-STING signaling, respectively. Mechanistically, SARS-CoV-2

20

ORF9b protein interacts with RIG-I, MDA-5, MAVS, TRIF, STING, TBK1, and

21

prevents TBK1 phosphorylation, thus impeding the phosphorylation and

22

nuclear trans-localization of IRF3 activation. Overexpression of SARS-CoV-2

6

which causes coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), is a novel emerging

7

coronavirus that is spreading globally and may be lethal to humans and other

animals, posing significant threats to public health worldwide.2-4 In the 21st

HCoV-OC43, and HCoV-HKU1, which, in most condition, only cause the

16

common cold via the infection of the human upper respiratory tract, but in

17

children, elderly, and immunocompromised patients, they also lead to severe

coronaviruses are not essential for viral replication and virion assembly, they

emerging. dsRNA, produced by many viruses during replication, is a common

viral pathogen-associated molecular patterns (PAMPs) assumed for immune

sensing by pattern recognition receptors (PRRs).14 The cytosolic retinoic

15

acid-inducible gene (RIG)-I-like receptors (RLRs) and the endosomal toll-like

16

receptors (TLRs) recognize dsRNAs from intermediates generated during viral

17

replication, resulting in the serial activation of signaling cascades to induce the

18

production of type I and III IFNs.14,15 The coronaviruses have a homologous

19

genome, the similar replication intermediates, and a same life cycle; thus, it

20

seems that SARS-CoV-2 can be similarly recognized by the RNA sensors as

other coronaviruses to elicit immune responses.16 MDA5 can recognize murine

sensing of MHV in oligodendrocyte cells.18 Upon the sensing of cytosolic

Results

2

SARS-CoV-2 ORF9b antagonizes type I and III IFNs

3

To explore the function of SARS-CoV-2 ORF-9b in viral infection, SeV was

4

used to infect HEK293T cells expressing SARS-CoV-2 ORF9b. Using

5

RT-qPCR analysis, we found that, compared with the control HEK293T cells

6

that not express any viral protein, SARS-CoV-2 ORF9b expressing cells

7

exhibit suppressed induction of IFN-β, IFN-λ1, and two ISGs called ISG56 and

8

CXCL10 after SeV infection (Fig. 1). Similar results were observed when

9

transfected a dsRNA mimic poly (I:C) into HEK293T cells to stimulate the

10

antiviral immunity (Fig. 1). However, SARS-CoV-2 ORF-9c, another alternative

11

ORF within the N gene, has no effect on neither SeV infection- nor poly (I:C)

12

transfection-induced type I and III IFN production (Supplemental Fig. 1-2).

13
14

Next, we try to map the layer where SARS-CoV-2 ORF-9b exerts its inhibitory

15

effect on IFN production. We co-transfected SARS-CoV-2 ORF-9b with RIG-IN

16

(an active form of RIG-I), MDA-5, MAVS, TBK1, and IRF3-5D into HEK293T

17

cells. The luciferase reporter assays showed that SARS-CoV-2 ORF9b could

18

obviously inhibit the activities of type I (IFN-β-Luc) and III (IFN-λ1-Luc) IFN and

19

ISG (ISRE-Luc) luciferase reporters induced by RIG-IN, MDA-5, MAVS, TBK1,

we first explore its subcellular localization using confocal microscopy. The

plasmid expressing SARS-CoV-2 ORF9b was transfected into HeLa cells, 20

showed that SARS-CoV-2 ORF9b has a strong co-localization signal with

17

mitochondria, but it is only weakly co-localized with ER and Golgi (Fig. 3). Next,

18

we studied the co-localization of SARS-CoV-2 ORF9b with components of the

microscopy observation showed that SARS-CoV-2 ORF9b has a completely

2

co-localization with MASV but partially localized with RIG-I, MDA-5, TBK1,

3

TRIF, and STING (Fig. 3).

4
5

Results from luciferase reporter assays suggest that the action step of

6

SARS-CoV-2 ORF9b might be upstream of IRF3 (Fig. 2). We postulated that it

7

might interact with molecules upstream IRF3 of the innate antiviral signaling

8

pathways. To determine which protein is the target of SARS-CoV-2 ORF9b, we

9

performed coimmunoprecipitation experiments. The plasmid expressing

10

Myc-tagged SARS-CoV-2 ORF9b were co-transfected with plasmids of RIG-I,

11

MDA-5, MAVS, TBK1, TRIF, STING, or IRF3 individually. Whole cell lysates

12

were subjected to immunoprecipitation using antibodies as indicated (Fig. 4).

13

Immunoprecipitation results indicate that SARS-CoV-2 ORF9b can associate

14

with RIG-I, MDA-5, MAVS, TBK1, TRIF, and STING, but not IRF3, which

15

consistent with the co-localization studies (Fig. 4). These data show that

16

SARS-CoV-2 ORF9b may target multiple molecules of the RIG-I/MDA-5-MAVS,

transduced from upstream molecules of RIG-I/MDA-5-MAVS, TLR3-TRIF, and

2

cGAS-STING signaling pathways. Thus, we investigated the effect of

3

SARS-CoV-2 ORF9b on TBK1 phosphorylation, an important biochemical

4

process for IRF3 activation and subsequent IFN transcription. The

5

phosphorylation of TBK1 was induced by overexpression of RIG-IN, MAVS, or

6

TRIF, and by STING activated by its ligand 2’-3’cGAMP. When SARS-CoV-2

ORF9b plasmid was co-transfected, the phosphorylation of TBK1 induced by

SARS-CoV-2 ORF9b Targets Multiple Antiviral Pathways to Inhibit IFNs

SARS-CoV-2 ORF9b was co-expressed in these cells, IRF3 phosphorylation

2

was dramatically impaired (Fig. 5). To determine whether SARS-CoV-2 ORF9b

3

can still affect IRF3 phosphorylation in a viral infection, we used RNA virus,

4

SeV, as a surrogate for SARS-CoV-2 to perform the virus infection studies.

5

Control HeLa cells transfected with empty vector and HeLa cells expressing

6

SARS-CoV-2 ORF9b were infected with SeV, 20 hours later, the cells were

7

lysed for SDS-PAGE and immunoblotting analysis. The results indicated that

8

SeV infection could induce the phosphorylation of both TBK1 and IRF3 (Fig. 6).

9

When SARS-CoV-2 ORF9b was overexpressed in these cells, SeV-induced

10

TBK1 and IRF3 phosphorylation was significantly suppressed. Thus,

11

SARS-CoV-2 ORF9b can inhibit TBK1 and IRF3 phosphorylation stimulated by

12

SeV infection.

13
14

The transcription of IFNs was initiated by the phosphorylated IRF3 that

translocated into the nucleus. The retention of IRF3 in the cytosol from its

nuclear translocation will arrest its action on IFN induction. Since SARS-CoV-2

17

ORF9b inhibits IRF3 phosphorylation, next, we examined the effect of the

18

SARS-CoV-2 ORF9b on SeV-induced IRF3 nuclear translocation. In resting

19

cells, IRF3 was primarily distributed in the cytosol regardless of the expression

20

of SARS-CoV-2 ORF9b or not (Fig. 6). When infected with SeV, IRF3 was

translocated into nucleus of the control cells, however, IRF3 was restricted in

SARS-CoV-2 ORF9b impairs antiviral immunity

5

Although SARS-CoV-1 ORF9b suppresses IFN production, whether it can

6

antagonize the antiviral immunity during a viral infection is still unknown. Thus,

7

we activated the antiviral signaling pathways by transfecting TBK1, and

8

explore whether SARS-CoV-2 ORF9b could affect the antiviral ability of cells

9

expressing TBK1. HEK293T cells expressing TBK1 alone and HEK293T cells

10

expressing both TBK1 and SARS-CoV-2 ORF9b were infected with VSV-eGFP,

11

commonly used as a model virus to study the effect of IFN on viral replication.

12

The infection of the virus was determined by examining the GFP positive cell

13

under the fluorescent microscopy. The viral replication was determined by

14

measuring the titer of the virus released into the culture medium. The results

15

show that HEK293T cells expressing TBK1 and SARS-CoV-2 ORF9b have

16

more GFP positive cells than that expressing TBK1 alone, suggesting that

17

SARS-CoV-2 ORF9b might promote VSV-eGFP infection (Fig. 7). The viral

18

titer from the culture medium of HEK293T cells expressing both TBK1 and

19

SARS-CoV-2 ORF9b is higher than that from HEK293T cells expressing TBK1

20

alone; thus, SARS-CoV-2 ORF9b may facilitate VSV-eGFP replication (Fig. 7).

21

These data indicate that overexpressing SARS-CoV-2 ORF9b can enhance

22

virus infection and replication by blunting TBK1-induced antiviral immunity.

Discussion

2

The pandemic of COVID-19 is affecting the economy, transport, country’s

3

relationships, and people’s life and health worldwide. A global effort is putting

4

to find various strategies COVID-19 treatment. The immune system is

5

essential for defense against virus infection; unfortunately, it is subverted by

6

SARS-CoV-2 by suppressing the type I and III responses and enhancing the

7

proinflammatory response, which will accelerate the viral replication and

8

damage to host tissues and organs.10 Type I and III IFN responses play a

9

critical role in human antiviral immunity against SARS-CoV-2 and restoration of

10

type I and III IFNs in COVID-19 patients is effective as a therapeutic option in

warranted.15,27,28,36 Here, we identify SARS-CoV-2 ORF9b can antagonize type

13

I and III IFNs and impair host antiviral immunity. Overexpression of

14

SARS-CoV-2 ORF9b inhibits the production of type I and III IFNs induced by

15

SeV and poly (I:C). SARS-CoV-2 ORF9b inhibits the activation of

16

RIG-I/MDA-5–MAVS, TLR3-TRIF, and cGAS-STING signaling pathways.

17

Molecular mechanism studies show that SARS-CoV-2 ORF9b interacts with

18

RIG-I, MDA-5, MAVS, TRIF, STING, and TBK1. SARS-CoV-2 ORF9b inhibits

19

TBK1 phosphorylation induced by RIG-/MDA-5-MAVS and cGAS-STING

signaling. Consequently, SARS-CoV-2 ORF9b inhibits the phosphorylation and

does not affect IFN activation induced by RIG-I signaling.38 Thus, it is of great

12

interest to further investigate whether SARS-CoV-2 ORF9b also involves in the

13

suppression of IFNs. During the preparation of this manuscript, another

14

recently showed that SARS-CoV-2 ORF9b suppresses type I interferon

15

responses by targeting TOM70.39 Although the molecular mechanism of how

16

Orf9b inhibits type I IFN responses through interacting with TOM70 is not

17

investigated, it is proposed that ORF9b may compete with HSP90 for binding

18

to TOM70 or may induce the production of lactic acid, which has been proven

19

to inhibit IFN-I responses.39 Consistent with the above findings, we

20

demonstrated that SARS-CoV-2 ORF9b inhibits the production of type I IFN

SARS-CoV-2 ORF9b Targets Multiple Antiviral Pathways to Inhibit IFNs

2

Lacking a biosafety level 3 laboratory, we have to use another RNA virus, SeV,

3

to perform the viral infection studies. We found that overexpression of

4

SARS-CoV-2 ORF9b can significantly reduce the production of IFN-β, IFN-λ1,

5

ISG56, and CXCL10 stimulated by SeV infection (Fig. 1). We also found that

6

SARS-CoV-2 ORF9b can inhibit SeV-induced phosphorylation and nuclear

7

trans-localization of IRF3 (Fig. 6). Moreover, overexpression of SARS-CoV-2

8

ORF9b in HEK-293 cells can facilitate the replication of VSV-eGFP, which is

9

sensitive to IFN signaling activation; thus SARS-CoV-2 ORF9b may enhance

10

VSV-eGFP replication by suppressing IFN production (Fig. 7). Although

11

SARS-CoV-1 ORF9b was reported to inhibit IFN production, its role in viral

12

infection is currently unknown; thus, this is the first report that coronavirus

13

ORF9b suppresses SeV-induced type I and III IFN production and promote

VSV-eGFP replication.

Luciferase reporter assays showed that SARS-CoV-2 ORF9b could inhibit the

promoter activities of IFN-β, IFN-λ1, and ISGs induced by multiple molecules

18

of RIG-I/MDA-5-MAVS, TLR3-TRIF, and cGAS-STING signaling pathways (Fig.

20

with numerous components of RIG-I/MDA-5 signaling pathways, such as RIG-I,

21

MDA-5, and MAVS. Although we found that SARS-CoV-2 ORF9b associates

with MAVS (Fig. 4) and inhibits MASV-induced IFN activation (Fig. 2), it cannot

explain why SARS-CoV-2 also inhibit TRIF- and STING-induced IFN

2

production. Thus, we hypothesis that SARS-COV-2 might (1) target TRIF and

3

STING directly or target signaling molecules that parallel to or downstream of

4

the converging point of RIG-I/MDA-5-MAVS, TLR3-TRIF, and cGAS-STING

5

signaling pathways. Thus, firstly, we evaluate whether SARS-CoV-2 ORF9b

6

directly targets TRIF and STING. Coimmunoprecipitation results indicated that

7

SARS-CoV-2 ORF9b could be associated with TRIF and STING (Fig. 4), which

8

also consists of the co-localization between SARS-CoV-2 ORF9b and TRIF or

9

STING (Fig. 3). Although these results can explain why SARS-CoV-2 ORF9b

10

can inhibit TRIF and STING-activated IFN signaling pathways, we are also

11

curious about whether it can target TBK1, a molecular at the converging point

12

of RIG-I/MDA-5-MAVS, TLR3-TRIF, and cGAS-STING signaling pathways.

13

Coimmunoprecipitation results indicated that SARS-CoV-2 ORF9b could

14

interact with TBK1 (Fig. 4); thus, demonstrated that SARS-CoV-2 ORF9b

15

might perform its inhibitory effect on IFN production at the layer of TBK1.

16

Combined with the results that SARS-CoV-2 ORF9b inhibits the induction of

17

type I and III IFNs byTBK1 but not IRF3-5D, we propose that ORF8b fulfills this

18

role at the layer or upstream of TBK1. Then we explore whether SARS-CoV-2

19

ORF9b can affect the phosphorylation of TBK1 and IRF3. Immunoblotting

20

results showed that overexpression of SARS-CoV-2 ORF9b could inhibit TBK1

SARS-CoV-2 ORF9b Targets Multiple Antiviral Pathways to Inhibit IFNs

RIG-I/MDA-5-MAVS signaling not only by interacting with RIG-I, MDA-5, and

2

MAVS but also by perturbing TBK1 phosphorylation. Similarly, SARS-CoV-2

3

ORF9b suppresses cGAS-STING signaling by interacting with STING and

4

inhibiting TBK1 phosphorylation. For the inhibition of TLR3-TRIF signaling,

5

SARS-CoV-2 ORF9b can only target TRIF but does not have any effect on

6

TRIF-induced TBK1 phosphorylation, suggesting that the inhibitory effect of

7

SARS-CoV-2 ORF9b on TRIF-induced IFN signaling activation is achieved by

8

interacting with TRIF directly but not by affecting TBK1 phosphorylation. In

9

addition, the M protein of both SARS-COV-1 and 2 can inhibit IFN production

10

by

11

phosphorylation;34,40 thus, the inhibition of TBK1 phosphorylation is not

12

required for the antagonizing of IFNs by these viral proteins. Overexpression of

13

SARS-CoV-2 ORF9b can inhibit IRF3 phosphorylation induced by RIG-IN,

14

MAVS, STING, TRIF, and SeV infection, thus the inhibition of IRF3

15

phosphorylation may be indispensable for IFN antagonizing by these viral

16

proteins. Therefore, SARS-CoV-2 ORF9b can target and interact with RIG-I,

17

MDA-5, MAVS, TRIF, and STING, and impaired TBK1 phosphorylation aviated

18

by the RIG-I/MDA-5-MAVS and cGAS-STING signaling pathways but not

20

provide the following novel findings: besides MAVS, ORF9b may also

associate with the dsRNA receptor RIG-I and MDA-5, TBK1, TRIF, and STING.

that besides mitochondrial localization, SARS-CoV-2 also localizes on ER and

7

Golgi (Fig. 3). ER is an important platform for TRIF and STING, while, Golgi is

8

an important platform for and TBK1.41-43 Thus, these findings explain the

9

co-localization and association of SARS-COV-2 ORF9b with TRIF, STING, and

10

TBK1.The localization of SARS-CoV-2 ORF9b on ER and Golgi may provide

11

the platform for its inhibition effects on TRIF, STING- and TBK1-induced IFN

12

production. Thus, this study extended our understanding of the molecular

13

mechanisms of coronavirus ORF6b-mediated IFN antagonizing.

14
15

SARS-CoV-2 is more sensitive to IFN treatment than other coronaviruses,28

16

multiple viral proteins become more critical to suppress IFN production at

17

different steps to ensure the production and function of IFNs are minimized

18

during SARS-CoV-2 infection. SARS-COV-2 ORF9b targets multiple proteins

19

of the distinct immune signaling pathways, which may suppress IFN signaling

20

at different steps. Similarly, SARS-CoV- 2 ORF6 and MERS-CoV ORF4b are

21

capable of perturbing multiple innate antiviral signaling pathways by target

22

various components of these pathways.38,44,45 Although cGAS-STING is

SARS-CoV-2 ORF9b Targets Multiple Antiviral Pathways to Inhibit IFNs
1

cytosolic dsDNA sensing pathway, coronaviruses, a family of RNA viruses,

2

also encode viral proteins such as papain-like protease to impair STING

3

function; thus, this pathway is essential in defending against coronavirus

4

infection.20,21 And the inhibition of cGAS-STING pathway by SARS-CoV-2

5

ORF9b may suggest that this pathway may play a role in SARS-CoV-2

6

clearance, thus, drugs or chemicals such as 2’-3’cGAMP that activates this

7

pathway may be considered to be used in COVID-19 treatment.

8
9

Distinct methods have shown that SARS-CoV-2 ORF9b inhibits type I and III

10

IFN production by targeting multiple proteins of antiviral signaling pathways,

11

we should be conscious that the transfection system might be different from

12

the real viral infection. Therefore, further studies should be conducted in the

13

context of real SARS-CoV-2 infection experiments. The accessory proteins of

14

coronaviruses have been proposed to be not essential for viral replication.

15

Ther are not directly involved in viral assembly,7 thus, theoretically, the ORF9b

16

null SARS-CoV-2 might available if it cannot affect the translation and

17

expression of N protein which is a structural protein for virion assembly.

18

However, whether this ORF9b null SARS-CoV-2 virus is accessibility still need

19

experimental validation. When this mutant virus is available, the real viral

20

infection studies should contribute to our understanding of the role of ORF9b in

21

IFN antagonizing.

SARS-CoV-2 ORF9b Targets Multiple Antiviral Pathways to Inhibit IFNs
1

Although the administration of exogenous IFNs is show to be valid for

2

SARS-CoV2 clearance on both SARS-CoV-2 patients and cell models,26,29,36,46

3

full evaluation of this treatment requires extensive studies on the relative

4

importance of all IFN-antagonizing viral proteins encoded by SAR-CoV-2. Thus,

5

our findings that the SARS-COV-2 ORF9b suppresses type I and III IFN

6

production contribute to our understanding of the pathogenesis of COVID-19,

7

and the identification of multiple protein targets may provide more precise

8

treatment of COVID-19.

IFN-λ1, ISG56, and CLXL10 production. Plasmids of pcDNA6B empty vector (500 ng) or
SCV2-ORF9b (500 ng) were transfected into HEK-293T cells, 24 hours later, cells were
infected with SeV infection or transfected with poly (I:C) transfection as indicated. At 9 and
12 hours after stimulation, the expression of IFN-β, IFN-λ1, ISG56, and CLXL10 in these
cells was determined by RT-qPCR analysis. The results of one representative experiment
was shown to represent three independent biological replicates. Error bars indicate SEM.

Figure 7 Overexpression of SARS-CoV-2 ORF9b impairs TBK1-dependent antiviral
immunity. Plasmids were transfected into HEK-293 cells as indicated, 24 hours

after transfection, the cells were infected with VSV-eGFP (MOI=0.001). Ten
hours after infection, the GFP-positive cells were observed (a), and the culture
supernatant (20 hours post-infection) was harvested for plaque assays to
measure the titer of extracellular VSV-eGFP (b). Fluorescent imaging results
are representative of two independent experiments. Scale bar, 50 μm. In panel
