Abstract

14

The coronavirus pandemic introduced many changes to our society, and deeply affected

15

the established in biomedical sciences publication practices. In this article, we present a

16

comprehensive study of the changes in scholarly publication landscape for biomedical sciences

17

during the COVID-19 pandemic, with special emphasis on preprints posted on bioRxiv and

18

medRxiv servers. We observe the emergence of a new category of preprint authors working in the

19

fields of immunology, microbiology, infectious diseases, and epidemiology, who extensively used

20

preprint platforms during the pandemic for sharing their immediate findings. The majority of these

21

findings were works-in-progress unfitting for a prompt acceptance by refereed journals. The

22

COVID-19 preprints that became peer-reviewed journal articles were often submitted to journals

23

concurrently with the posting on a preprint server, and the entire publication cycle, from preprint

24

to the online journal article, took on average 63 days. This included an expedited peer-review

25

process of 43 days and journal’s production stage of 15 days, however there was a wide variation

26

in publication delays between journals. Only one third of COVID-19 preprints posted during the

27

first nine months of the pandemic appeared as peer-reviewed journal articles. These journal articles

28

display high Altmetric Attention Scores further emphasizing a significance of COVID-19 research

29

during 2020. This article will be relevant to editors, publishers, open science enthusiasts, and

30

anyone interested in changes that the 2020 crisis transpired to publication practices and a culture

31

of preprints in life sciences.

Introduction

34

The lifecycle for any research starts and ends with a scholarly communication. Despite a

35

variety of avenues to communicate research findings, the foundation of the modern publication

36

practices is a publication in a peer-reviewed journal. The peer-review system is, at present, deeply

37

engraved in scientific minds as the golden standard for research quality. Certainly, the peer-review

38

process improves the drafted manuscript, but previous studies showed that its positive effect on

39

the overall quality of the final report is minor [1]. Besides, the traditional peer-review system is

40

notorious for reviewer bias, lack of agreement between reviewers, harsh criticism concealed by

41

anonymity, multiple cycles of reviews and rejections by different journals, and associated delays

42

and expenses [2].

43

Alternatively, or additionally, authors may choose to deposit their manuscripts to preprint

44

servers, institutionally or privately supported repositories of preprints. A preprint is a complete

45

manuscript shared publicly prior to officially undergoing the peer-review process. Notably, it has

bioRxiv preprint doi: https://doi.org/10.1101/2021.01.21.427563; this version posted January 21, 2021. The copyright holder for this preprint

46

likely undergone many rounds of internal review by authors and colleagues involved in its

47

preparation to ensure that ideas presented are well-versed and that the study can be easily validated

48

by the supporting data. A preprint submitted to one of the main preprint servers undergoes basic

49

screening for its scope, plagiarism, ethical issues and compliance, often performed as quickly as

50

within 24 hours, after which it is published online with a digital object identifier (DOI) that allows

51

it to be citable and trackable. Once posted on a preprint server, preprint can be read, commented

52

on-site or by email, and further shared on the Web and through social media (e.g. Twitter).

53

Additionally, any revision of a preprint’s content or status, such as publication in a peer-reviewed

54

journal, is time-stamped.

55

Over the last decade, biomedical sciences have been slowly adapting a preprint culture.

56

The bioRxiv server owned by Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory was launched in November 2013

57

with the purpose of covering all aspects of life sciences research [3], and by 2018, it accumulated

58

37,648 preprints. By the end of September 2020, this number has doubled to 97,194 preprints. The

59

medRxiv preprint server, launched in June 2019 by BMJ, Yale University, and Cold Spring Harbor

60

Laboratory to cover all aspects of research in the medical, clinical, and related health sciences [4],

61

contained 11,329 preprints on September 30, 2020. The first and the most well-known preprint

62

server, arXiv.org was launched in 1991, and by the end of September 2020 had accommodated

63

1,769,336 preprints [5] in the fields of physics, mathematics, computer science, quantitative

64

biology, quantitative finance, statistics, electrical engineering and systems science, and economics.

65

The preprint platforms were widely explored as hubs for disseminating scientific findings [6],

66

especially for early-stage researchers [7], which revealed a number of social and technical issues

67

associated with their adoption [8]. The top four concerns with preprint servers included scooping

68

of scientific results [9], poor data quality [10], spread of misinformation [11], and varied and non-

69

transparent deposition policies [6]. Additionally, many authors refrained from depositing preprints

70

due to unclear journal policies on whether a preprint will be accepted for a journal publication after

71

being deposited on a server [12]. Nevertheless, research communities, including life sciences [13],

72

persisted in their adoption of preprints [14], gradually realizing that a preprint submission offers

73

many advantages:

74
75
76
77

1. Allows authors to establish the scientific priority by timestamping the first public record
of the research study [15];
2. Provides authors with a community feedback that can help them to further improve the
manuscript quality [16,17];

78

3. Expedites research sharing [15,16];

79

4. Increases research visibility [18,19];

80

5. Streamlines the journal submission process [20];

81

6. Allows sharing studies that are difficult to publish in traditional journals (works-in-

82
83

progress, negative results, replications, contradictions) [16];
7. Provides an open-access publication record [16].

84

Those benefits are what make scientific publishers and funders embrace preprints and

85

acknowledge them as works of scholarly communication. In June 2020, the National Institutes of

86

Health (NIH) launched the Preprint Pilot [21] to index preprints that come from NIH-funded

87

projects in PubMed, the largest database of biomedical scholarly works. This pilot builds on the

88

role of PubMed Central as a repository for NIH-supported [22] peer-reviewed articles and NIH’s

89

guide notice NOT-OD-17-050 [23]. Library system vendors such as EBSCO, Proquest, Ex Libris,

90

and OCLC WorldCat have been investing substantially in open access discovery tools for a variety

91

of open sources, including preprints [24]. The practice of inviting journal submissions from

bioRxiv preprint doi: https://doi.org/10.1101/2021.01.21.427563; this version posted January 21, 2021. The copyright holder for this preprint

92

preprint servers is wide spread [25]. In June 2020, MIT Press and the Berkeley School of Public

93

Health launched a new COVID-19 journal, Rapid Reviews: COVID-19, which, after a thorough

94

peer-review, will publish preprint articles with good research and discredit those with bad [26].

95

Considering the reported influence of preprints on policy-making during the COVID-19 pandemic

96

[27] and ongoing article retractions [28], the concern about the quality of un-refereed preprints is

97

genuine [29]. The Sinai Immunology Review Project is an example of an institutional effort to

98

review and validate the COVID-19 related preprints posted to medRxiv and bioRxiv servers [30].

99

The Review Commons platform, launched in December 2019, is another initiative on that

100

direction, where preprint authors are offered an opportunity to request a journal-independent

101

portable peer review [31]. Lastly, it is worth mentioning new editorial policies from eLife that

102

resulted in the launch of Preprint Review [32] and made the preprint deposition mandatory prior

103

to a journal submission [33].

104

Since the first report on a pneumonia of unknown origin in Wuhan, China on Dec 30, 2019

105

[34], over 10,000 articles have been published in scholarly journals and on preprint servers, as well

106

as about 4,000 clinical trials registered. These figures attest an outstanding response of the

107

scientific community to what was in January 2020 simply known as the “novel coronavirus” [35].

108

As our health workers fought on the front lines against coronavirus and general population

109

followed rapidly changing policies, the scientific community immediately sought to contribute by

110

sharing and exchanging newly discovered information promptly and openly. Fortunately, the

111

necessary tools were already in-place and biomedical researchers quickly adopted preprint servers

112

as suitable platforms for timely, open, and transparent scientific communication. In this paper, we

113

set our goal to assess all aspects related to this adoption by analyzing the effect of COVID-19

114

pandemic on publication practices in biomedical sciences.

Scope.

118

medRxiv and bioRxiv preprint servers that compiled all their COVID-19 SARS-CoV-2 preprints

119

in the database that at the time of this study contained 1,964 bioRxiv and 7,258 medRxiv preprints.

120

For peer-reviewed scholarly works, we referred to journal and review articles indexed in PubMed,

121

of which about 1,400 had associated preprints.

122

Timeline.

123

China appeared on Dec 31, 2019 [36]. By the end of January, the first research reports appeared

124

as preprints, clinical trials, and journal articles [37]. In this manuscript, we focus on preprints

125

deposited between Jan 1 and Sept 30, 2020. The publication rates for these preprints were

126

evaluated on Sept 30 and on Dec 7, 2020. The deposition rate for preprints was evaluated during

127

Jan 1 – Nov 30, 2020. Altmetric analysis is based on articles published during Jan 1 - Nov 19,

128

2020, and includes articles with a publication date of Dec 1, 2020 (retrieved on Nov 19, 2020).

129

The latter date was included because we noticed that when date is unknown, Dimensions

130

automatically assigns it the first of the month. Similar enrichment of dates on the first of the year

131

and each month was observed in Crossref [38].

132

Terminology.

The scope of this study is COVID-19 related literature. For preprints, we focused on

database of COVID-19 SARS-CoV-2 preprints from medRxiv and bioRxiv [40], Rxivist [41],

155

Crossref [42], E-utilities [43], Dimensions [44], CORD-19 [45], and CADRE[46].

156

Metadata for each individual COVID-19 preprint deposited to bioRxiv or medRxiv was

157

gathered by accessing the bioRxiv database of COVID-19 SARS-CoV-2 preprints from medRxiv

158

and bioRxiv, to which we will further refer as BioRxiv API [40]. Data were retrieved in JavaScript

159

Object Notation (JSON) format. Data analysis and visualization was done in Python (pandas,

160

numpy, requests, matplotlib, bokeh, and seaborn) using Jupyter Notebook.

161

To search PubMed, we used Entrez Programming Utilities (E-utilities) [43], an application

162

programming interface (API) that allows searching 38 databases from the National Center for

163

Biotechnology Information (NCBI). For E-Utilities, data were downloaded via CSV and converted

164

to Microsoft Excel for further analysis and visualization.

165

Rxivist [41] is a Python-based web crawler that parses the bioRxiv website, detects newly

166

posted preprints, and stores metadata about each item in a PostgreSQL database. The metadata we

167

extracted contained title, authors, submission date, category, DOI for preprint and, if published,

168

the new DOI and the journal of publication.

169

Crossref [42] is an official DOI registration agency of the International DOI Foundation

170

that establishes a cross-publisher citation linking system for academic that include journals,

171

conference proceedings, books, data sets, etc. It works with thousands of publishers to provide

172

authorized access to their metadata including DOI, publication date and other basic information.

173

CORD-19 or COVID-19 Open Research Dataset [47] is a free resource of over 200,000

174

scholarly articles about COVID-19, SARS-CoV-2, and related coronaviruses prepared by the

175

Allen Institute for AI (AI2) in collaboration with many partners and released on March 16, 2020.

176

We used its 2020.09.02 release downloaded on 2020.09.30 from CADRE [46] for metadata

177

associated with refereed journal articles.

178

Dimensions [48] is a comprehensive database that links scholarly outputs to a research

179

analytics suite to track the impact of research across its life cycle. Dimensions tracks many preprint

180

servers [49] but we only used it for bioRxiv and medRxiv preprints (see Data Flow Chart in SI for

181

the links between used datasets).

Statistical analysis.

183

ANOVA were conducted on the Statistical Package for Social Sciences version 27 (SPSS). Data

184

are presented as means (M) ± standard deviations (SDs), accompanied by medians and modes,

185

when necessary.

186

Altmetric data. Altmetric Attention Scores were retrieved from Dimensions by querying for

187

articles published between Jan 1 and Nov 19, 2020, in selected journals. For COVID-19 related

188

publications in a journal, we used the recommended query for COVID-19 [50] supplemented with

189

the query for journal id. For journal publications unrelated to COVID-19, we gathered all articles

190

from the journal and removed those related to COVID-19 from the dataset. For COVID-19 articles

191

that were associated with preprints, we matched DOI’s of articles found by Dimensions to DOI’s

192

of articles we identified earlier as published preprints. To identify articles that were not associated

193

with preprints, we removed from the dataset of COVID-19 related publications all articles that had

194

associated bioRxiv and medRxiv preprints.

196

Analysis of published preprints. When a preprint is published in a peer-review journal, a

197

reference to the new DOI of the journal article appears next to its title, and DOIs of a preprint and

198

a published article are permanently linked in indexing platforms and tools, which pull from various

199

APIs. Rxivist [41] showed to be an excellent tool for extracting published DOIs for preprints

200

eventually appearing as peer-reviewed journal articles but only when bioRxiv records linked

201

preprints to their external publications. Rxivist also had a two weeks delay in updating its metrics,

202

and it might be of this delay that some peer-reviewed preprint analogues were missing from

203

Rxivist. Additionally, at the time of our study, Rxivist did not include medRxiv preprints in its

204

database, which changed after Nov 27, 2020. We found that the most reliable method of extracting

205

metadata about each individual preprint was by accessing the BioRxiv API [40]. Using the Python

206

library requests, we were able to extract information about each preprint based on DOI, which

207

gave us a column called ‘published.’ Within this column, if the preprint was also published in a

208

journal, the metadata provided the DOI that corresponded to the published version of the paper.

209

To ensure we found all published preprints, we also accessed data from Crossref, Dimensions, and

210

CORD-19 APIs. To establish the linkage between the preprints and corresponding peer-reviewed

211

journal articles we performed both, DOI and title matching. All channels were then combined and

212

duplicates were dropped. For detailed demonstration of data obtained by every data channel, see

213

Published Collections in SI.

214

To validate whether we found all peer-reviewed preprint versions based on a combination

215

of Rxivist, Crossref, CORD-19, Dimensions, and BioRxiv API, we randomly selected a sample of

216

100 preprints that our data returned as “unpublished” from both bioRxiv and medRxiv, and

217

searched Google Scholar by title. Our analysis of “unpublished” preprints returned 10% of bioRxiv

218

and 4% of medRxiv preprints as being published in refereed journals. All found journal

219

publications had slight modifications in article titles or authors’ list, and the original “unpublished”

220

preprints were not linked on preprint servers to the corresponding published versions. In

221

comparison, this false-negative rate is lower than the 37.5%, reported by Blekhman et al. [51]. All

222

manually found journal article versions of “unpublished” preprints were manually added to data

223

discussed in this article.

224

Double DOI. When we looked for published preprints based on title matching, we encountered

225

a few instances when two published DOIs existed for a peer-reviewed preprint version. In one

226

case, it was erratum for the paper and in the other case it was a publication on another preprint

227

server. In both cases, we used only the DOI for the article in the peer-reviewed journal and

228

publication on another preprint server was removed from further analysis. We also encountered a

229

few cases when preprints with different DOIs were linked to the same DOI of the published

230

version. On inspection, preprints with different DOIs were somewhat similar in titles and authors’

231

list but not identical. For our analysis, we kept only one DOI for a preprint that was published

232

earlier.

233

PubMed. As mentioned in the Introduction, the NIH Preprint Pilot started in June 2020 and at

234

this stage, it primarily focuses on NIH-supported and COVID-19 related preprints from various

235

servers. By Sept 26, PubMed indexed 1,048 preprints from medRxiv, bioRxiv, ChemRxiv, arXiv,

236

Research Square, and SSRN, of which 1,043 were on COVID-19, and this constituted only 11.5%

237

of 9,072 medRxiv and bioRxiv COVID-19 related preprints from the BioRxiv API. For these

238

reasons, we did not use PubMed as a data source for preprints. We used PubMed (through E-

239

Utilities) to obtain metadata on peer-reviewed articles of “Journal Article” and “Review” article

240

types as the most traditional types of scholarly output. These two types constitute about 24% [52]

241

of all PubMed publications that include 187 different publication types [53].

242

In analyzing PubMed dates, we found that articles with a missing day-of-publication were

243

coded as being published on January 1st; a similar issue was reported earlier for Crossref dates

244

[38]. Based on low number of preprints in January, we decided to avoid discussing January data

245

for PubMed (this month is omitted in Fig 2).

246

Categories. In general, we used a single category for a preprint as indicated in metadata from

247

the BioRxiv API. However, as of September 25, we found six out of total 1,956 of COVID-19

248

related bioRxiv preprints (0.3%) that displayed two categories. Since this contradicted the servers’

249

statement that “Only one subject area can be selected for an article”, we omitted the additional

250

category in our analysis. The journals’ scope categories were extracted from Crossref [54].

251

Publication process delays. Preprints deposition dates were extracted from Crossref. For

252

journal articles received, accepted, and published online dates, we used E-Utilities:

253

PubMedPubDate@PubStatus = “received”; PubMedPubDate@PubStatus = “accepted” and

254

ArticleDate@DateType="Electronic”. When ArticleDate@DateType="Electronic” from PubMed

255

was not available, we substituted it with the “created-date” from Crossref.

256

Before deciding on which dates to use in our studies, we carefully analyzed those used in

257

previous studies and noted some inconsistency between different authors (Table 4). Unfortunately,

258

dates from different sources intended to represent the article publication date differ between each

259

other (see Article Publication Dates in SI) and are often incomplete. The amount of missing dates

260

in our dataset was 44.7% for “pub_date” from PubMed and over 90% for “published-online” or

261

“published-print” from Crossref. In this article, we referred to refereed journals to resolve

262

disputable

263

ArticleDate@DateType="Electronic” from PubMed is the date that exactly corresponds to the

264

The “date-created” from Crossref differed from the online publication date of a journal article in

Results

283

1. Submission rates during the coronavirus pandemic

284

With the COVID-19 outbreak, both bioRxiv and medRxiv experienced a surge of COVID-

285

19 preprint submissions. The first preprint on COVID-19 appeared on Jan 13 of 2020 [56], and the

286

number of submissions increased at a staggering rate afterwards (Fig 1). By Dec 4, 2020, the

287

number of COVID-19 preprints reached 8,750 on medRxiv and 2,416 on bioRxiv. In comparison,

288

we identified only 187 Zika related, and 17 Ebola related preprints deposited to bioRxiv during

289

the entire duration of each epidemic (for Zika: Nov 2015 - Aug 2017; for Ebola: May 2014 - Jan

290

2016).

291

Consistently throughout the pandemic, medRxiv experienced a significantly higher flux of

292

COVID-19 preprints as compared to bioRxiv (Table 1 and Scholarly Output in SI). On average,

293

medRxiv preprints on COVID-19 constituted 78% (SD = 2%) of combined bioRxiv and medRxiv

294

preprints on any single month, except January, when the number of COVID-19 related medRxiv

295

preprints was only 27% of COVID-19 related bioRxiv preprints. May was the most productive

296

month for authors of medRxiv preprints. In June, the number of medRxiv COVID-19 preprints

297

declined by 31%, while the number of bioRxiv preprints increased by 6%. After June, we noted a

298

slow decline in the number of COVID-19 preprints on both servers, with the total number of

299

bioRxiv and medRxiv COVID-19 preprints in November representing only 49% of those deposited

300

in May.

We then analyzed how the high flux of COVID-19 preprints compares to that of non-

COVID-19 preprints and biomedical journal articles published during the same period (Fig 2,

310

Table 1). Notably, during the pandemic, we observe the growth in preprints submissions not only

311

on COVID-19 but also on other topics unrelated to coronavirus. Consistently, bioRxiv received

312

significantly more of non-COVID-19 preprints than medRxiv. While the COVID-19 submissions

314

bioRxiv and have been increasing for medRxiv (see Scholarly Output in SI), indicating a growing

popularity of medRxiv server.

327
328

The growth of preprints, however outstanding, is lagging behind the amount of peer-

329

reviewed journal articles (see Scholarly Output in SI). In 2019, preprints represented 2.6% of all

330

biomedical literature in PubMed [57]. This percentage was derived with respect to biomedical

331

preprints from multiple servers and all biomedical literature indexed in PubMed [58], while our

332

study is defined by bioRxiv and medRxiv preprints in relation to “Journal Article” and “Review”

333

article types in PubMed. Based on our analysis, in February, the amount of COVID-19 preprints

334

from medRxiv and bioRxiv constituted only 2% of biomedical articles on all topics but this fraction

335

increased to 15% in May (Fig 3). The number of peer-reviewed articles on COVID-19 has been

336

growing since the start of pandemic reaching a peak in July. In contrary, the number of unrelated

337

to coronavirus peer-reviewed literature has been slowly declining. As a result, the fraction of

338

COVID-19 journal articles with respect to all articles indexed in PubMed has been increasing since

339

the start of pandemic and reached 71% in October. At that time, the amount of COVID-19 bioRxiv

340

and medRxiv preprints was at 9% with respect to COVID-19 peer-reviewed literature in PubMed,

341

but this fraction was as high as 57% in February 2020. Thus, early in pandemic, there were over

342

half as many preprints as there were peer-reviewed articles about the newly emerged coronavirus.

2. Preprints categories

350

Preprints are deposited in a certain category that defines their subject area. As expected,

351

microbiology, the field that studies microscopical organisms, such as viruses, is the top category

352

for bioRxiv preprints on COVID-19 (Fig 4A). Other leading bioRxiv categories for COVID-19

353

preprints are bioinformatics that analyzes and interprets large and complex biological data, and

354

immunology that studies the immune system. The top three leading categories for COVID-19

19

bioRxiv preprint doi: https://doi.org/10.1101/2021.01.21.427563; this version posted January 21, 2021. The copyright holder for this preprint
(which was not certified by peer review) is the author/funder, who has granted bioRxiv a license to display the preprint in perpetuity. It is made
available under aCC-BY 4.0 International license.

355

medRxiv preprints are infectious diseases, epidemiology, and public and global health (Fig 4B).

356

Clearly, the study of infectious diseases focuses on infectious agents, epidemiology deals with the

357

possible control of diseases, and public and global health focuses on disease prevention, all of

358

them closely related to our understanding of the nature of coronavirus, and the development of

359

corresponding diagnostic methods and treatment. The three leading categories for COVID-19

360

preprints in bioRxiv incorporate 1.3 times as many preprints as the remaining 20 subject

361

categories. The three leading categories for COVID-19 preprints in medRxiv incorporate 3.2 times

362

as many preprints as the remaining 48 subject categories (see Categories Analysis in SI). As

363

expected, the leading categories have the highest daily accumulation rates (Fig 5).

375

of preprints unrelated to COVID-19 were deposited into categories of neuroscience, microbiology,

376

and bioinformatics. In fact, neuroscience was the leading category through Nov 2018 as was

377

demonstrated in Blekhman’s study [51]. That same study named bioinformatics, genomics, and

378

evolutionary biology as other leading categories. Interestingly, the field of bioinformatics remains

379

among the leading categories for both COVID-19 related and unrelated preprints, prior to or during

380

the coronavirus pandemic, which demonstrates the growing importance of this field for all subject

381

areas, its interdisciplinary nature, and the familiarity of bioinformatics research community with

382

the preprint culture.

383

3. Published preprints

384

Preprints deposited on a preprint server can later undergo a peer-review process to be

385

published in refereed journals. Here, we will refer to a preprint that has a peer-reviewed journal

386

article analogue as a published preprint. Once a preprint is published in peer-reviewed journal,

387

preprint and article’s DOIs are permanently linked in indexing databases and on the preprint server;

388

nevertheless, establishing this association can sometimes be challenging. For instance, the title of

389

the research study or the authors’ list may change during the publication process, complicating

390

auto-matching the preprint and its published version. Computing the number of preprints published

391

as journal articles requires tedious analysis and the design of matching algorithms [59]. To ensure

392

we find all published preprints, we combined data from various APIs (BioRxiv API, Crossref,

393

Dimensions, Rxivist, and CORD-19) and matched publications based on both, DOIs and

394

publication titles (see Published Collections in SI). We found that during Jan 1 – Sept 30, on

395

average, 18% of COVID-19 preprints deposited to bioRxiv and medRxiv servers resurfaced as

396

peer-reviewed journal articles.

397

As expected, the majority of published preprints were those deposited into the leading

398

categories: microbiology, immunology, and bioinformatics represented 59% of all published

399

bioRxiv preprints, while infectious diseases, epidemiology, and public and global health contained

400

76% of all published medRxiv preprints (Fig 6). The publication rates vary across the preprint

401

categories (Fig 7). Thus, COVID-19 preprints in bioRxiv categories of microbiology and

402

biochemistry display the highest publication rates of 22%. The infectious diseases category in

403

medRxiv contained 18% of preprints that later appeared as journal articles and it alone provided

404

43% of all published medRxiv preprints on COVID-19. At the same time, other leading categories,

405

epidemiology and public and global health, both had publication rates of 13%, which is lower than

406

an average rate for medRxiv. The lowest publication rates were observed for COVID-19 preprints

407

deposited into the neuroscience category in bioRxiv and health economics in medRxiv. The

408

highest publication rate of 30% was observed for pathology in medRxiv, although it was only 10%

409

for bioRxiv.

423
424

The publication rates of 18% observed for COVID-19 related preprints on Sept 30, is low

425

as compared to publication rate of 42% [51] or 70% [3] reported for pre-pandemic preprints or for

426

previous health crises. For instance, for Ebola, 60% of the deposited preprints were published in

427

PubMed-indexed journals, and for Zika, the corresponding amount was 48% [60]. One limitation

428

to our study is that articles that are undergoing the peer-review or various editorial processes are

429

invisible to us. The dependence of publication rates on the analysis timespan was noted by

430

Blekhman et al. [51], who showed that publication rate for preprints was 67% during the

431

comprehensive study that covered the period of several years (2013-2016) but only 20% during
25

432

the last year of their study (2018) [51]. Similarly, our reported publication rates are higher than

433

rates reported by two independent studies of COVID-19 preprints deposited by the end of April

434

2020. One study reported that 6.1% of 2,102 COVID-19 related preprints from Dimensions

435

resurfaced as peer-review journal articles [61], while another study reported that only 4% of

436

COVID-19 related bioRxiv and medRxiv preprints were published [62]. We further evaluated the

437

possibility that publication rates for COVID-19 preprints deposited into medRxiv and bioRxiv

438

servers between Jan 1 and Sept 30 were underestimated, especially considering the length of the

439

publication process for COVID-19 related preprints (see next section). To that end, we reanalyzed

440

publication rates on Dec 7, 2020, for COVID-19 preprints deposited between Jan 1 and Sept 30,

441

2020, and we found them at 34% and 29%, for bioRxiv and medRxiv preprints, respectively.

442

Despite being higher than the publication rate of 18% derived from our data in October, reanalyzed

443

publication rates are still low.

449

We analyzed various delays involved in the publication process using the model depicted

450

in Scheme 1. In our proposed model, the interval between preprint posting on a preprint server and

451

online publication of the corresponding peer-reviewed journal article constitutes the elapsed time

452

(T), which can be further expressed as:

453

T = t + tR + t

(1),

454

where pre-submission time (t) is the interval between preprint posting on a preprint server

455

and its submission to the peer-reviewed journal; peer-review time (tR) is the duration of the peer-

456

review process; and production stage time (t) is the interval between article official acceptance

457

statement and its publication online.

458

The descriptive statistics for these publication delays are summarized in Table 2 and Fig 8

459

and will be discussed in detail below. It is worth noting that none of the publication delays display

460

a standard Gaussian distribution (Fig 9), thus we discuss both their medians and means.

We also explored whether T can explain the different publication rates for preprint

500

categories. For example, medRxiv preprints in health policy (M = 94.3, SD = 41.1, N = 10) and

501

health informatics (M = 82.2, SD = 41.8, N = 20) have long mean T and display low publication

502

rates, while preprints in pathology display the shortest T (M = 50.9, SD = 33.0, N = 10) and, in

503

fact, have high publication rate (Fig 7 and Categories Analysis in SI). On the contrary, bioRxiv

504

preprints in cell biology display the longest T (M = 89.2, SD = 46.4, N = 10) but not the lowest

505

publication rate. Pearson’s analysis showed that elapsed time and publication rate do not correlate

506

for bioRxiv preprints and only slightly correlate for medRxiv preprints (for medRxiv: r(41) =

507

0.39, p = 0.011; for bioRxiv: r(19) = 0.13, p = 0.581). As publication rates settle, we plan to re-

508

analyze whether the disciplinary publication trends are affected by the duration of the publication

509

process.

4.2. Review time (tR) and production stage time (t)

511

While the elapsed time describes how quickly it takes for a preprint to resurface as a journal

512

article, it is unable to distinguish whether the successful expediting of a publication process is a

513

result of the new policies implemented by journal publishers or the old practices of posting a

514

preprint on a preprint server shortly after or even prior to its submission to the peer-reviewed

515

journal. In our quest to explain the expedited publication times, we analyzed review time (tR) and

516

the production stage period (t) (Fig 10).

523

We found that a mean review time (tR) for COVID-19 related bioRxiv and medRxiv

524

preprints is 43.4 days (Table 2), which is significantly shorter (t(949) = 53.85, p < 0.001, Cohen’s

525

d = 1.75) than a standard review time of 100 days [65]. The difference in the mean tR for COVID-

526

19 related medRxiv and bioRxiv preprints is not statistically significant (Table 3). Our data

527

showed that 𝑡𝑅 for COVID-19 articles has significantly decreased (t(949) = 92.86, p < 0.001,

528

Cohen’s d = 3.01), by about 70%, during the pandemic, as compared to the earlier analysis by

529

Björk and Solomon, who in 2013 reported that biomedicine journals exercised a mean tR of 141

530

days [66]. We found that tR for COVID-19 articles associated with preprints was significantly

531

shorter than 51.0 days (t(949) = 7.23, p < 0.001, Cohen’s d = 0.24) reported for all coronavirus

532

articles [61]; and significantly shorter than 84 days (t(949) = 38.63, p < 0.001, Cohen’s d = 1.25)

533

reported for articles published on topics other than COVID-19 during 2020 [67]. Although both

534

studies describe the period of early pandemic, since January and until the end of April, the former

535

study reports a mean review time of 51.0 days [61], while the latter a median review time of 6 days

536

[67]. This discrepancy in early data is likely due to a sever skew in frequency distribution for tR.

537

The major advance in speeding up the peer-review process was observed for PLOS ONE.

538

For COVID-19 related articles published in PLOS ONE between Jan 1 and Oct 23, 2020, the peer-

539

review took on average 63.7 days. This is significantly shorter than 125 days in 2016 [68] (t(59) =

540

15.13, p < 0.001, Cohen’s d = 1.95) and 126.6 days in April 2020 [61] (t(59) = 15.52, p <

541

0.001, Cohen’s d = 2.00). Of the top ten journals that published medRxiv and bioRxiv COVID-

542

19 preprints, Journal of Clinical Virology had the shortest mean review time of 21.4 days and

543

Nature Communications had the longest mean review time of 74.6 days (Table 5, Fig 10).

549

The mean production stage time (t) for COVID-19 related bioRxiv and medRxiv preprints

550

is 14.6 days, about one third of the average tR found above for the same set of articles (Table 2).

551

The difference in t for medRxiv and bioRxiv preprints on COVID-19 is not significant (Table 3).

552

As compared to the t of 147 days reported by Björk and Solomon in 2013 [66], t reduced by 90%

553

for COVID-19 articles associated with preprints; this difference being statistically significant

554

(t(915) = 254.89, p < 0.001, Cohen’s d = 8.42). However, a study early in the pandemic reported

bioRxiv preprint doi: https://doi.org/10.1101/2021.01.21.427563; this version posted January 21, 2021. The copyright holder for this preprint

555

a significantly shorter t = 9.3 days [61] (t(915) = .17, p < 0.001, Cohen’s d = .34), although

556

this value was obtained for all published coronavirus articles, not just those associated with

557

preprints. Of the top ten journals that published COVID-19 bioRxiv and medRxiv preprints,

558

Journal of Clinical Virology has the shortest t of 3.3 days and Nature Communications has the

559

longest t of 21.9 days (Table 5, Fig 10).

560
561

4.3. Pre-submission time (t)

562

We found that an average pre-submission time (t) for COVID-19 related preprints is 5.6

563

days (Table 2), a positive value implying that, on average, authors posted their manuscript to the

564

preprint server before advancing their preprints to journal publishers (Fig 11). Authors of bioRxiv

565

COVID-19 preprints waited longer than authors of medRxiv COVID-19 preprints; this difference

566

being statistically significant (Table 3). The distribution of t frequencies indicates a median at 0

567

days (Table 2, Fig 9). A more detailed analysis showed that 44% of the COVID-19 preprints were

568

deposited to bioRxiv or medRxiv servers after being submitted to the journal (negative t) and

569

only 28% of preprints were posted more than 10 days before they were submitted to the journal

570

where they were published. Our results mirror earlier findings by Anderson [69], who reported

571

those values as 57% and 29%, respectively, for papers that had preprint analogues and were

572

published in Nature journals between 2013 and 2018. This authors’ behavior was also observed

573

for arXiv preprints [70] and explained by a widespread fear for “getting scooped” when making

574

details of research publicly available. We thus confirm that the previously reported trends are

575

restated for COVID-19 preprints deposited between Jan 1 and Sept 30, 2020. We believe that

576

during the pandemic, bioRxiv and medRxiv preprint servers were not used to gather a community

577

feedback because authors primarily pursued rapid and open dissemination of critical research.

5. Journals

585

5.1. Top journals by number of submissions

586

By Oct 23, 2020, 1,359 preprints from both, medRxiv and biorxiv appeared as peer-

587

reviewed journal articles in 525 different academic journals, with only 25 journals (4.8%)

588

publishing at least ten preprints (see Leading Journals in SI). The top three journals publishing the

589

majority of bioRxiv preprints were Science, Nature, and Nature Communications. The top three

590

journals publishing the majority of medRxiv preprints and, in fact, the majority of combined

591

medRxiv and bioRxiv COVID-19 related preprints were PLOS ONE, Clinical Infectious Diseases,

592

and Journal of Medical Virology.

593

Previous analysis of bioRxiv preprints showed that Scientific Reports, eLife, and PLOS

594

ONE published the majority of server’s preprints by the end of 2018 [51]. While PLOS ONE

bioRxiv preprint doi: https://doi.org/10.1101/2021.01.21.427563; this version posted January 21, 2021. The copyright holder for this preprint

595

remains a leader in publishing COVID-19 related preprints, the majority of them (91.6%) are from

596

medRxiv. Scientific Reports during this period published only 0.4% of COVID-19 articles, of

597

which 20.7% were originally preprints and 75% of which were specifically from bioRxiv. In

598

comparison, two studies early in the pandemic reported that the majority of preprints were

599

published by Nature, Cell, and Science (for COVID-19 preprints indexed in Dimensions) [61] and

600

by Journal of Medical Virology (for COVID-19 bioRxiv and medRxiv preprints) [37].

601

5.2. Elapsed time (T) by journals

602

We reasoned that variations in the set of journals publishing the majority of preprints could

603

be explained with difference in elapsed times for each journal (Fig 12). Indeed, in post hoc

604

Bonferroni-corrected pairwise comparison, we found that the Journal of Medical Virology, Nature,

605

Cell, and Science had significantly shorter elapsed time (T) as compared to PLOS ONE (p < .001

606

 0.03). A one-way ANOVA test showed that there was a significant main effect (F(5, 175) =

607

19.33, p < .001, p2 = 0.36). The other four journals did not differ between each other. This

608

explains why early in the pandemic, Journal of Medical Virology, Nature, Cell, and Science

609

incorporated more published preprints than PLOS ONE. As can be seen from Fig 12, it took longest

610

for COVID-19 preprints to be published in Nature Communications or PLOS ONE, and quickest

611

- in Journal of Clinical Virology (Table 5).

616
617

5.3. Alternative ranking for top journals

618

In the previous section, we discussed journals that published the majority of bioRxiv and

619

medRxiv preprints based on the number of preprints. By this metrics, mega-journals that publish

620

a large number of articles will systematically appear as leaders in publishing preprints. An

621

alternative way to allocate leading journals is to evaluate what fraction of journal’s publications

622

come from preprints. For this, we analyzed the percentage of published COVID-19 related

623

preprints with respect to all journal and review articles in a particular journal, as indexed in

624

PubMed between Jan 1 and Sept 30, 2020. We found that COVID-19 preprints published in the

bioRxiv preprint doi: https://doi.org/10.1101/2021.01.21.427563; this version posted January 21, 2021. The copyright holder for this preprint
(which was not certified by peer review) is the author/funder, who has granted bioRxiv a license to display the preprint in perpetuity. It is made
available under aCC-BY 4.0 International license.

625

mega-journal PLOS ONE constituted only 0.6% of its total publication volume (see Leading

626

Journals in SI). However, if we only compare to the research and review articles on COVID-19,

627

we find that 20.8% of PLOS ONE COVID-19 articles are former preprints. A similar scenario is

628

observed for other multidisciplinary journals, like Science or Nature. For example, 34.8% of

629

COVID-19 articles in Nature Communications come from preprints but they constitute only 0.5%

630

of the total publication volume for this journal. The COVID-19 portfolio of BMC Medicine and

631

Journal of Clinical Microbiology incorporated 36.4% and 33.3%, respectively, of former preprints.

632

These percentages become 5.3% and 5.7% when we consider what fraction of all articles in BMC

633

Medicine and Journal of Clinical Microbiology, respectively, are COVID-19 former preprints. As

634

compared to Nature Communications and PLOS ONE, these percentages are higher, indicating

635

that BMC Medicine and Journal of Clinical Microbiology have disciplinary scope that is adequate

636

for coronavirus research and is more specialized than that of Nature Communications or PLOS

637

ONE. Our analysis of COVID-19 papers associated with preprints shows that Emerging Microbes

638

& Infections published 68.8% of COVID-19 related preprints, which constituted 17.7% of this

639

journal’s COVID-19 articles. Emerging Microbes & Infections is an open access peer reviewed

640

journal from Taylor & Francis, which scope, as indexed by Scopus [54], is parasitology, infectious

641

diseases, microbiology, virology, immunology, drug discovery, and epidemiology, categories that

642

are all very relevant to coronavirus research.

643

5.4. Categories of preprints and corresponding journals

644

To analyze the scope of journals that published COVID-19 preprints, we plotted preprint

645

subject categories vs. journal’s scope categories, as defined by Scopus [54], for all published

646

preprints and their article analogues (Fig 13). We found that the majority of COVID-19 preprints

647

in both medRxiv and bioRxiv were published in journals whose scope is general biochemistry,

648

genetics, and molecular biology. Additionally, microbiology preprints from bioRxiv were

649

published in journals specialized in microbiology, infectious diseases, and virology. The latter

650

category is currently absent in either bioRxiv or medRxiv platforms but is listed among Scopus

651

categories. The majority of medRxiv preprints were published in journals whose scope is general

652

medicine. Preprints in infectious diseases and epidemiology were published in journals whose

653

scope is infectious diseases and microbiology (medical). For both, medRxiv and bioRxiv, the

654

COVID-19 preprints in leading categories also resurfaced as journal articles in multidisciplinary

655

journals, of which PLOS ONE, Science, and Nature Communication published the majority of

656

them (see Leading Journals in SI).

5.5. Publishers

667

The top two publishers for COVID-19 bioRxiv and medRxiv preprints were Elsevier and

668

Springer. By Sept 30, they published 40% of all COVID-19 preprints deposited into bioRxiv and

669

medRxiv during Jan 1 – Sept 30, although medRxiv preprints constituted the majority of their

670

publications (73% in Elsevier and 65% in Springer). Elsevier journals that published the majority

671

of COVID-19 preprints were International Journal of Infectious Diseases, Journal of Clinical

672

Virology, and Cell. Springer journals that published the majority of COVID-19 preprints were

673

Nature Communications, Nature, and Scientific Reports. The third major publisher for COVID-19

674

preprints was Oxford University Press, which journals like Clinical Infectious Diseases, The

675

Journal of Infectious Diseases, Journal of Travel Medicine, and American Journal of Clinical

676

Pathology published 7% of bioRxiv and medRxiv preprints on COVID-19 by Sept 30, 2020. The

677

third major publisher for COVID-19 bioRxiv preprints was the American Society for Microbiology

678

that alone published 7% of all COVID-19 preprints deposited into bioRxiv by Sept 30, 2020.

679

6. Impact of preprints

680

Previous studies of bioRxiv preprints deposited during 2013-2017 [64], 2014-2016 [71],

681

and 2015-2018 [18], all ascertain an altmetric advantage of articles that were associated with

682

preprints over articles that did not come from preprints. A notion of altmetric advantage was

683

derived from higher Altmetric Attention Scores, which summarize various mentions of the article

684

in the public policy documents, Wikipedia articles, mainstream news, blogs, and various social

685

platforms [72]. For example, both bioRxiv and medRxiv preprints are widely shared on Twitter

686

and even prior to pandemic, a single preprint was reported to generate on average 13-18 tweets

687

[69].

688

To assess the visibility of COVID-19 preprints, we compared the Altmetric Attention

689

Scores of COVID-19 related articles that had associated preprints to those that did not, and to

690

articles unrelated to COVID-19 that were published between Jan 1 and Nov 19, 2020 (Fig 14,

691

Table 6). We also stratified our results by journal to eliminate a potential effect of a journal’s

692

impact factor (IF) or other journal-specific variables. For the top ten journals that published the

693

majority of COVID-19 preprints, we found that Altmetric Attention Scores for articles that had

694

associated preprints were slightly higher on average but not significantly different from articles

695

that did not have associated preprints (Table 6). As expected, all COVID-19 related articles had

696

an altmetric advantage over non-COVID-19 related publications in the same journals. For

697

example, in Nature, COVID-19 related articles published between Jan 1 and Nov 19, 2020 had on

698

average an altmetric score of 1077.8 (SD = 1467.8, N = 253). This is significantly higher (t(263.3)

699

= 7.76, p < 0.001, Cohen’s d = 0.89) than an average altmetric score of 354.3 (SD = 722.3, N =

700

2766) for all other articles in the same journal published during the same period. Similar analysis

701

of all ten journals resulted in average altmetric score of 332.8 for COVID-19 related works vs.

702

91.0 for non-COVID-19 publications, this difference being statistically significant (Table 6). As

703

seen from Fig 14, altmetric scores vary for different journals. In fact, we found a strong Pearson’s

704

correlation between the Altmetric Attention Scores for journal articles and journals’ impact factors

705

(for COVID-19 articles that were deposited as preprints, r(8) = 0.99, p < 0.001).

Discussion

718

In this paper, we explored how publication practices in biomedical sciences reacted to an

719

emergency, such as COVID-19 pandemic. Our first focus was analyzing the usage of two major
45

720

biomedical preprint servers, bioRxiv and medRxiv. Following the deposition of the first preprint

721

on a “novel coronavirus” in mid-January 2020 [56], preprint submissions to these two platforms

722

increased rapidly. Submissions of new coronavirus related preprints reached 10 to 20 per day by

723

February and increased to about 150 per day by May (Fig 1). In addition to this incredible flow of

724

COVID-19 preprints, we observed about a 35% increase in deposition of preprints on all other

725

topics. Towards the end of 2020, the amount of posted COVID-19 related preprints has been

726

declining each month (Fig 1) but preprints unrelated to coronavirus continue to be submitted at a

727

relatively constant rate (Fig 2). Preprints traditionally represented only a small fraction of scholarly

728

literature; however, during the pandemic the fraction of combined medRxiv and bioRxiv COVID-

729

19 preprints over all journal and review articles indexed in PubMed in the given month increased

730

from 2% in February to 15% in May (Fig 3). A higher flux of biomedical preprints was also

731

observed for Zika and Ebola outbreaks [60], which was suggested to result from an increase in

732

research activities, and the statement of prestigious journal publishers and funders on the

733

importance of preprints and data sharing in public health emergencies [73]. In contrast, COVID-

734

19 pandemic was accompanied by a severe reduction in research activities due to social distancing

735

policies and stay-at-home orders issued around the world. We hence raised the question regarding

736

the origin of the amplified usage of preprint servers during the COVID-19 pandemic?

737

The answer to this question lies within the trends in the most active fields in each preprint

738

server. Our analysis revealed that the majority of COVID-19 related preprints in bioRxiv were

739

deposited in those fields that are most relevant to coronavirus research, such as microbiology,

740

bioinformatics, and immunology (Fig 4A); while the leading categories in all other topics during

741

the same period were neuroscience, microbiology, and bioinformatics. Note that prior to the

742

pandemic, the three leading categories in bioRxiv were neuroscience, bioinformatics, and

bioRxiv preprint doi: https://doi.org/10.1101/2021.01.21.427563; this version posted January 21, 2021. The copyright holder for this preprint

743

genomics [51]. Thus, while neuroscience researchers remain as the main users of the bioRxiv

744

platform, we see an emergence of a new community of preprint authors working in the fields of

745

immunology and microbiology. The latter can perhaps be further refined as virology, a category

746

currently absent in bioRxiv (and medRxiv), but listed among journal scope categories, where the

747

majority of microbiology preprints were later published. With regard to medRxiv server, the

748

leading categories for COVID-19 related preprints are infectious diseases, epidemiology, and

749

public and global health (Fig 4B); however, it is not possible to compare these figures with the

750

pre-COVID-19 data due to the relatively recent launch of this preprint server. To explain, medRxiv

751

was founded only six months prior to the pandemic and increased its volume by almost 16-fold

752

during 2020, with 66% of this increase attributed to preprints on COVID-19. Overall, we noted

753

that during the coronavirus pandemic preprint servers attracted a new pool of researchers from

754

previously underrepresented fields. This agrees well with an earlier report of Coates et al. who

755

found that 83% of COVID-19 preprint authors were posting a preprint for the first time [62]. It is

756

worth noting that the same study also found that most corresponding authors were not switching

757

to COVID-19 research from other fields, therefore, we propose that the most plausible factor

758

contributing to the observed surge of preprints is the extensive use of preprint repositories by new

759

COVID-19 researchers. This is remarkable considering preprints are rarely taken into

760

consideration for tenure or promotion decisions in biomedical sciences. Further studies monitoring

761

these new clients of preprint servers will be valuable in determining whether this is just a transient

762

behavior triggered by COVID-19 or whether these practices will persist beyond pandemic

763

duration.

764

Once we established that increased volume arises from new users, we further inquired

765

whether, besides rapid dissemination of research results, they were attracted by any specific of the

47

bioRxiv preprint doi: https://doi.org/10.1101/2021.01.21.427563; this version posted January 21, 2021. The copyright holder for this preprint

766

known benefits for preprint platforms. Among many, we focused on: (i) opportunity to share

767

studies that are difficult to publish in traditional journals or those that would be rather works-in-

768

progress than complete reports, and/or (ii) access to public comments that could help improving

769

the manuscript prior to journal submission.

770

We first explored whether COVID-19 preprints were in-progress or complete works by

771

analyzing how many of the COVID-19 preprints later appeared in refereed journals, and used that

772

metric as an indicator for their suitability for publication. Our analysis showed that by Sept 30,

773

2020, only 18% of the bioRxiv and medRxiv preprints related to COVID-19 appeared as peer-

774

reviewed journal publications. Anticipating a dependence of publication rate on the analysis

775

timespan [51], we assessed the time it takes for a preprint to resurface as a journal article and found

776

that our study on Sept 30, 2020, undervalued publication rate for preprints deposited any time after

777

the end of July (mean T = 63.4 days, Table 2). To derive a meaningful publication rate, we

778

reanalyzed the same pool of COVID-19 related preprints (deposited to bioRxiv and medRxiv

779

servers by Sept 30) on December 7, 2020, which is 68 days past Sept 30 (mean bioRxiv T = 68.5

780

days, Table 2). As expected, we found higher publication rates for COVID-19 preprints, 33.8%

781

and 28.8% for bioRxiv and medRxiv servers, respectively; although these values remained lower

782

than those reported for pre-pandemic preprints (42% [51] or 70% [3]) and for previous health

783

crises, such as Ebola and Zika (60% and 48%, respectively) [60]. We therefore concluded that

784

COVID-19 preprints are mostly works-in-progress, in line with earlier suggestions [62]. In the

785

future, it will be important to reevaluate publication rates for COVID-19 related preprints. It is

786

likely that some COVID-19 preprints keep circulating through repeated cycles of journal

787

submissions and rejections, and thus remain invisible to our analysis.

788

We then assessed whether coronavirus researchers used bioRxiv and medRxiv preprint

789

servers to gather public feedback by examining the pre-submission time (t) for COVID-19

790

preprints. Our analysis of publication delays yielded a median t of 0 days for published COVID-

791

19 preprints, implying that preprints were submitted to preprint servers and to journals

792

simultaneously (Fig 9 and Fig 11). A more detailed analysis showed that only 28% of preprints

793

were deposited into servers for over 10 days prior to journal submission. This trend of shortening

794

the waiting period between preprint deposition to a server and its submission to a journal had been

795

already reported in studies involving bioRxiv [69] and arXiv preprints [70]. Note that pre-

796

submission time may include submissions to multiple journals, thus a low t value also means that

797

the majority of the so far published COVID-19 preprints were accepted to journals at their first

798

submission. Thus, we see no change in authors’ behavior due to pandemic: COVID-19 manuscripts

799

deposition as preprints occurred concurrently to their submission to journals; this implies that

800

authors of COVID-19 preprints did not specifically pursue the pre-submission feedback when

801

posting their research study on a preprint server.

802

In line with previous reports [52,61,67], our analysis of publication delays demonstrated

803

another important change in scientific publishing in response to the COVID-19 pandemic, namely,

804

expedited publication process for COVID-19 related articles. For instance, COVID-19 article

805

versions of preprints are currently reviewed in about half the time (43 days) as compared with the

806

30-year average peer-review time of 100 days [65]. Further, COVID-19 articles associated with

807

preprints are being reviewed 70% faster and prepared for the final version 90% faster than

808

biomedical articles were prior to the pandemic (tR = 141 days and t = 147 days, in 2013 [66]).

809

This acceleration is also evident when comparing articles associated with bioRxiv preprints:

810

COVID-19 related preprints transformed into peer-reviewed journal publications 2.5 times faster

49

811

during the study period, Jan 1 – Oct 23 2020, as compared to bioRxiv preprints before the

812

pandemic (TΣ = 63.4 days in 2020 vs 155-166 days by 2018 [51,64]; Table 3). This is

813

unprecedented and was not observed for Zika or Ebola related preprints, where the median elapsed

814

time for both outbreaks (150 days [60]) was reported to be no different than the normal publication

815

timeline.

816

This really speaks to a success of modified journal editorial policies in expediting

817

publication process for coronavirus researchers. These initiatives [33,74] quickly led to a surge of

818

COVID-19 journal articles that in July represented about 62% of all journal and review articles

819

indexed in PubMed for that month. By the end of October 2020, 1,357 of COVID-19 preprints

820

from medRxiv and bioRxiv servers appeared in 525 different academic journals, with

821

multidisciplinary journals, such as PLOS ONE, Science, Nature, and Nature Communications,

822

accruing the highest number of former preprints (see Leading Journals in SI). Among the

823

specialized journals, Clinical Infectious Diseases, and Journal of Medical Virology published 6%

824

of all medRxiv preprints. The COVID-19 portfolio of BMC Medicine, Journal of Clinical

825

Microbiology, and Nature Communications was on one third composed of former preprints.

826

However, the highest fraction of preprints in all articles published by the journal was observed for

827

Emerging Microbes & Infections, where 69% of COVID-19 articles originated from preprints.

828

Journal champions varied at various moments throughout the pandemic, which was found to be

829

related to variations in publication times among the journals (Fig 12). For example, it took the

830

fastest for bioRxiv or medRxiv preprints to appear in Journal of Clinical Virology or Journal of

831

Medical Virology (T = 26.2 and 38.3 days, respectively), but longest in PLOS ONE and Nature

832

Communications (T = 89.4 and 102.7 days, respectively). On average, the publication process for

833

COVID-19 preprints posted to bioRxiv or medRxiv servers took about two months. This reflects

834

an earlier observation that a publication peak for COVID-19 preprints in May transfers to the

835

summit in July for journal article publications (Fig 2).

836

Complementary efforts of preprint servers and scholarly journals to disseminate knowledge

837

promptly, while differentiating reliable and important findings from those that may be misleading

838

attest to the upmost relevance of COVID-19 topic during 2020, as evident from Altmetric

839

Attention Scores for COVID-19 research articles (Fig 14). For example, COVID-19 related articles

840

published in Nature journal between Jan 1 and Nov 19, 2020 had a mean altmetric score of 1,077.8

841

as compared to 354.3 for articles on all other topics. The highest Altmetric Attention Score of

842

1,518.2 was observed for Nature journal articles associated with preprints. Despite the high

843

visibility of COVID-19 articles originated from preprints, our analysis showed no significant

844

altmetric advantage over COVID-19 articles that did not have a preprint version. This is in contrast

845

with previous findings of clear altmetric differential between articles deposited as bioRxiv

846

preprints and those that were not [18,64,71]. Considering the acute public interest in novel

847

coronavirus research, we believe that any scholarly work, whether it was an article, associated or

848

not associated with a preprint, received equivalent amount of social media attention during the

849

pandemic. The strong correlation we observed between the altmetric scores and journals’ impact

850

factors for COVID-19 articles tells us how popularized was the professional arena in biomedical

851

sciences during the pandemic.

852

In summary, our analysis showed that early in pandemic, preprints were prevailing in

853

disseminating findings on the topic of the public health emergency. Preprint authors deposited

854

them into fields previously underrepresented on bioRxiv or medRxiv servers but those that were

855

directly related to our understanding of the newly emerged coronavirus and ways to prevent the

856

spread of the disease. This new category of authors mainly pursued rapid and transparent scientific

857

communication but was not specifically interested in pre-submission feedback as observed from

858

preprints submissions onto servers occurring concurrently with the journal submissions. We

859

believe the majority of COVID-19 preprints were immediate in-progress findings, not suitable for

860

the direct transfer to refereed journals; this conclusion was based on the low publication rate for

861

COVID-19 preprints. The originally estimated publication rates were reaffirmed two months later,

862

which is how long it took on average for a COVID-19 preprint to go through the peer-review and

863

production stages. Both stages of the publication process were significantly expedited for COVID-

864

19 publications; but they varied widely among different journals. The COVID-19 preprints that

865

resurfaced as journal articles display exceptionally high Altmetric Attention scores echoing a high

866

social media engagement in coronavirus research. The concerted efforts of journal and preprint

867

publishers, institutions, funders, and individuals to bring us information and to facilitate its sorting

868

and evaluation, deserve special applauds. It is our hope that as pandemic recedes, biomedical

869

sciences will keep on building their relationships with preprint servers, while journal publishers

870

will retain policies that were most helpful in expediting, revising, and sharing critical research

871

output during the pandemic.
