Abstract
Coronavirus disease-19 (COVID-19) is the recent global pandemic caused by the virus Severe
Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2). The virus has already killed more
than one million people worldwide and billions are at risk of getting infected. As of now, there is
neither any drug nor any vaccine in sight with conclusive scientific evidence that it can cure or
provide protection against the illness. Since novel coronavirus is a new virus, mining its genome
sequence is of crucial importance for drug/vaccine(s) development. Whole genome sequencing is
a helpful tool in identifying genetic changes that occur in a virus when it spreads through the
population. In this study, we performed complete genome sequencing of SARS-CoV-2 to unveil
the genomic variation and indel, if present. We discovered thirteen (13) mutations in Orf1ab, S
and N gene where seven (7) of them turned out to be novel mutations from our sequenced isolate.
Besides, we found one (1) insertion and seven (7) deletions from the indel analysis among the 323
Bangladeshi isolates. However, the indel did not show any effect on proteins. Our energy
minimization analysis showed both stabilizing and destabilizing impact on viral proteins
depending on the mutation. Interestingly, all the variants were located in the binding site of the
proteins. Furthermore, drug binding analysis revealed marked difference in interacting residues in
mutants when compared to the wild type. Our analysis also suggested that eleven (11) mutations
could exert damaging effects on their corresponding protein structures. The analysis of SARSCoV-2 genetic variation and their impacts presented in this study might be helpful in gaining a
better understanding of the pathogenesis of this deadly virus.

Introduction
COVID-19 can be currently considered an menace to humankind brought about by the novel
Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) which began its journey from
the Wuhan province of the People’s Republic of China. [1]–[8] The infection basically targets the
respiratory framework of its host causing influenza-like sickness with symptoms such as cough,
fever, and in progressively serious cases, troubled breathing. [9]–[15] According to the data
available, mortality is higher in individuals of advanced ages (> 60 years ) and the ones with
comorbidities [16]–[21]. Apart from intense respiratory problems, COVID-19 has been shown to
cause systemic irritation prompting sepsis [22]–[25], intense cardiovascular injury [26]–[31],
cardiovascular breakdown [26], [32]–[36] and multiorgan failure in critical patients. [37] COVID19 has been rightly announced as a global pandemic by the World Health Organization (WHO) as
it has spanned over 200 countries and territories around the world. As of Oct 20, 2020, more than
40,648,527 individuals have been infected up until this point, with around 9,172,183 active cases
and 31,476,344 closed cases and 1,122,992 deaths (https://www.worldometers.info/coronavirus/).
While the USA has the highest number of confirmed cases (with over 8,456,653 so far) and has
more than 225,222 deaths to date. [38] China, the nation where everything started in November,
is presently on the downslope sustaining just above 200 active cases. [39]–[41] The vast majority
of the countries around the world were in lockdown to stop human to human transmission and halt
the spread of the disease. [42], [43]

Coronaviruses (CoVs) are enveloped, single-stranded, positive RNA viruses that are pathogenic
to their hosts. [44]–[48] SARS-CoV-2 is the causative agent behind COVID-19 and is more
pathogenic in contrast with previously observed SARS-CoV (2002) and Middle East respiratory
syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV, 2013)[49]–[58]. There is a dire need to examine the virus
more comprehensively to comprehend the system of pathogenesis, its destructiveness to develop
powerful therapeutic measures. [59] CoVs belongs to the Coronaviridae family under Nidovirales
order. They have been grouped into four genera that belong to α-, β-, γ-, and δ-coronaviruses. [60]
Among them, α-and β-COVs infect vertebrates, γ-coronaviruses avians, while the δ-coronaviruses
infect both. SARS-CoV, mouse hepatitis coronavirus (MHV), MERS-CoV, Bovine coronavirus
(BCoV), bat coronavirus HKU4, and human coronavirus OC43, including SARS-CoV-2, are βcoronaviruses. [61] Zoonotic transmission is the medium of transmission for each of the three

CoVs, SARS-, MERS-, and SARS-CoV-2, and they spread through close contact. The essential
multiplication number (R0) of the individual-to-individual spread of SARS-CoV-2 is around 2.6,
which implies that the confirmed cases develop at a striking exponential rate. [62] CoVs being 26
to 32 kb long have the biggest RNA viral genome. [63] The SARS-CoV-2 genome share
approximately 90% identity with essential enzymes and structural proteins of SARS-CoV.
Fundamentally, SARS-CoV-2 contains four basic proteins known as- spike (S), envelope (E),
membrane (M), and nucleocapsid (N) proteins. These proteins share high sequence similarity with
the sequence of the corresponding proteins in SARS– CoV, and MERS-CoV. Hence, it is vital to
scrutinize the SARS-CoV-2 genome to determine why this infection is progressively inclined to
be more infectious and lethal than its predecessors.
Utilizing Sanger sequencing and cutting-edge whole genome sequencing of SARS-CoV-2 isolates
from oropharyngeal samples, we depicted the genomic portraits of two genomes alongside other
Bangladeshi strains. [64]
In this study, we have analyzed the genomic arrangements of SARS-CoV-2 to identify the
mutations found within the genomes and anticipate their effect on the protein structure from a
structural biology perspective in order to shed light on the suitable therapeutics against this deadly
virus.

Methods
Virus Isolation
The patient's oropharyngeal samples SARS-CoV-2/human/BGD/NIB_01/2020 and SARS-CoV2/human/BGD/NIB-BCSIR_02/2020 were collected using the UTM™ kit containing 1 mL of viral
transport media (Copan Diagnostics Inc., Murrieta, CA, USA) on day 7 of the patient’s illness with
symptoms of cough, mild fever, and throat congestion. The specimen was tested positive for
SARS-CoV-2 by real-time reverse transcriptase PCR (rRT-PCR). Then, the viral RNA was
extracted directly from the patient’s swab using PureLink Viral RNA/DNA Mini Kit (Invitrogen).
The viral RNA was then converted into cDNA using SuperScriptTM VILOTM cDNA Synthesis Kit
(Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's instructions.

DNA Sequencing
Sanger Dideoxy sequencing
The forty eight (48) pair primers were designed to cover the whole genome of the virus by
following two conditions: (1) their sequence is conserved among all the available SARS-CoV-2
isolates and (2) the terminal of the amplicons will overlap with neighboring amplicons. The
polymerase chain reaction (PCR) was performed and the 48 primers then generated 47 amplicons
which were visualized in 1.5% Agarose gel electrophoresis. The amplicons were further purified
using Purelink PCR purification kit (ThermoFisher Scientific, USA). These purified amplicons
were sequenced using Sanger dideoxy method by “ABI 3500” with BigDye Terminator version
3.1 cycle sequencing kit (Applied Biosystems, USA). The raw reads were assembled by DNA
Baser (https://www.dnabaser.com) [65] and verified by SeqMan Pro®. Version 14.1. DNASTAR.

NGS Sequencing
Illumina Nextseq 550 next-generation sequencing technology was used to sequence the complete
genome of the SARS-CoV-2/human/BGD/NIB-BCSIR_02/2020 isolate to where Nextera DNA
Flex was utilized as library preparation kit for the synthesis of the nucleotides. [67] To cover the
300 cycle, the NextSeq High Output Kit was utilized as the reagent cartridge. To generate the
FASTQ data workflow the run mode was set as local run manager in every NextSeq 4-channel
chemistry. Analysis and Quality check was performed using a customized version of the DRAGEN
RNA pipeline, which was also available on local DRAGEN server hardware. The Illumina®
DRAGEN RNA Pathogen Detection App uses a combined human and virus reference to analyze
pathogen data. The raw reads were cleaned by trimming low-quality bases with Trimmomatic 0.36
(-phred33, LEADING:20, TRAILING:20, SLIDCitation. The assembly was performed by the
utilization of SPAdes using default parameters as well as used to cross-validate with the referencebased method as an internal control.
Variant Identification
Basic Local Alignment Search Tools (BLAST) [68] was employed to identify possible mutations
in Sanger Based sequenced nucleotide sequences. Nucleotide program of blast was selected for

this identification. The mapped polymorphisms were investigated for their occurrence frequency
worldwide and checked for their profile at CNCB3 resource. Chimera was utilized to visualize the
mapped polymorphisms. Besides, all the available Bangladeshi strains (n=323) of SARS-CoV-2
were retrieved from GISAID [69] and further explored to find out the most common mutations.
Indel Analysis
We ran BLAST for all Bangladeshi SARS CoV-2 genome profiles, to get a view on the pairwise
alignment comparison. Deleted sequences were closely investigated in Artemis Comparison Tool
window. [70] Gene regions are observed discreetly.
Mutational Effect Analysis
To observe the mutational effect of mapped polymorphisms, 3 dimensional (3D) structure was
built through the ROBETTA prediction server. [71] Later, the difference of the energy was
calculated by GROMACS in both wild type and mutant 3D structures to estimate the structural
abnormality and change in stability. [72] Binding site of both wild and mutant structure was
analyzed to check whether the amino acid residues are into the binding site region or not.
Drug-Binding Analysis
We have performed Molecular Docking using Autodock vina[73] for the analysis of interacting
residues to the druggable targets. We retrieved the structures of all the interacting drugs (.pdb files)
by virtual screening of the Drugbank database. Then we generated the .pdbqt files of the targets of
polymorphisms for docking experiments. Blind docking was performed for the identification of
the most effective binding site of these drugs. A grid box parameter for covering the whole protein
was set for all docking runs.

Exploration of variant in the sequenced isolates
We have found thirteen (13) mutations at the 93rd; C → T, 479th; T → A, 481th; C→A; 1015th; A
→ T, 2889th; C → T, 5098th; G → T; 5237th; C → T, 5642th; G → T, 8023rd; G → A, 23255th; A
→ G 28733rd; G → A, 28734th; G → A and 28735th; G → C from the MT509958 whole genome
(Table 1). However, the MT568643 whole genome showed no mutation against the reference
sequence. From them, six (6) mutations namely 93rd; C → T, 2889th; C → T, 23255th; A→G,
28733rd; G → A, 28734th; G → A and 28735th; G → C were found in CNCB3 resource where the
available mutations of SARS-CoV-2 were enlisted (Table 1). These mutations have already been
found in different countries where the SARS-Cov-2 has been sequenced. These mutations were
mostly found in the United States of America (USA) and the United Kingdom (UK) (Table 1).
The position of 93rd; C → T mutation is located in 5'UTR upstream region. And the position 2889th;
C → T mutation has shown no change to its protein sequence. The other 23255th; A→G, 28733rd;
G → A, 28734th; G → A and 28735th; G → C mutations can alter the amino acid sequence and can
have the missense effect on the protein (Table 1). Apart from these 6 mutations, seven (7)
mutations have shown as unique variants against the reference sequence (Table 1 and Fig 2).
There is no report previously having found for these mutations. Besides, we analyzed our assemble
genome to look for any insertion/deletions but these two genomes contain no deletions/insertions.
However, we have identified one (1) insertion and seven (7) deletions of the eight (8) Bangladeshi
strain

EPI_ISL_514614, EPI_ISL_445213, EPI_ISL_445217 and EPI_ISL_450842 (Table 2 and Fig
3). We additionally scrutinized these deleted regions but we didn’t find any domain or motif on
this region. Apart from our reported complete genomes, we have also identified the most common
mutations occurred in Bangladesh from the complete genomes reported in GSAID database from
Bangladesh. These genomes showed three mutations in the positions 14408, 23403 and 28878
compared to reference genome (Table 1).
Point mutations alter respective protein structures
We have analyzed the mutational effect of all the mutations. Therefore, the 3D structure was built
to explore the mutational effect on the protein structure (Figure 4). In this case, two types of 3D
structure was built i) the structure with wild type residue and ii) the structure with mutant residue.
We have performed the energy minimization of both the wild type and mutants. We have found
significant differences in the stability of the structure upon mutation (Table 3). Mutants 479th; T
→ A and 1015th; A → T showed higher energy minimization which predicted these proteins to be
more stable than the wild type. All the other protein models based on mutation showed less energy
minimization than the wild type protein model. Therefore, these protein structures could be more
unstable upon mutation in the protein sequence. The highest difference was observed in the
mutation in the 5642th position; G → T mutation (from -23276.78 kj/mol to -22377.976 kj/mol)
(Table 3). Afterwards, the binding site was analyzed to determine whether the wild type and the
mutant residues fell within the ligand binding site or not. The binding site residues confirmed that
all the mutations from the complete genome belonged to the binding site region (Fig 5). Later, we
have performed the drug binding analysis followed by virtual drug screening in DrugBank server.
Ivermectin and Remdisivir drugs topped the list of potential drug candidates. We then prepared
the protein structures and converted them to .pdbqt format for molecular docking experiment. We
identified the binding site region for each protein and set the grid box to allow the drugs only to
bind to that specific region. The binding affinity analysis showed that compared to the wild type,
the drug Ivermectin bound more tightly to proteins which has mutation at positions 479 (T → A),
5642 (G → T) and 8023 (G → A) which bound more loosely to proteins with mutations at
positions 481 (C→A), 1015 (A → T), 5098 (G → T) and 5237 (C → T). Remdisivir binds more
tightly to proteins with mutations at 28733 (G → A), 28734 (G → A), and 28735 (G → C) and
more loosely to 23255 (A → G) compared to the wild type (Table 4). It is to be noted that the

interaction of residues of wild type protein were found to be different than that of mutant model.
For example, 479th; T → A mutant model which acquired the V→D amino acid interacted with
Glu37, Glu41, LEU177, GLY180, LEU104, VAL108, HIS110, Glu87, Leu88, Lys141, Tyr154
residues whereas wild type interacted with Leu18, Val28, Glu37, Glu41, His 45, Leu53, Val54,
Ile71, Arg73, Val86, , Val121, Leu122, Asp139 (Fig 4).
Discussion
COVID-19 is highly contagious and the variation in its genome could be a leading reason for this
feature. Besides, to understand the origin of the strains, the exploration of the whole-genome
sequencing (WGS) data of SARS-CoV-2 strains is highly necessary. [75] Insights into the
mutations of SARS-CoV-2 is an important factor in developing therapeutics against the virus.
[76]–[78] In this study, we investigated the variation, insertion, and deletion of the Bangladeshi
SARS-CoV-2 strains. We collected the samples SARS-CoV-2/human/BGD/NIB_01/2020 and
SARS-CoV-2/human/BGD/NIB-BCSIR_02/2020 from the patients who were tested as COVID19 positive. We extracted the viral RNA from the samples and converted them to cDNA. We
performed the Sanger sequencing of SARS-CoV-2/human/BGD/NIB_01/2020 and Next
Generation Sequencing of SARS-CoV-2/human/BGD/NIB-BCSIR_02/2020. The total length of
the genomes were 29724 and 29737 nucleotides respectively. These two genomes were submitted
in both Global Initiative on Sharing All Influenza Data (GISAID) and National Center for
Biotechnology Information (NCBI) databases. These two databases accepted the genomes and
provided the accession number EPI_ISL_458133 from GISAID and MT509958 and MT568643
from NCBI. We investigated the possible variations of these two genome and found thirteen (13)
mutations in SARS-CoV-2/human/BGD/NIB_01/2020 against the reference genome of SARSCoV-2 (Table 1 and Figure 2). The mutations belonged different regions of the genome, but
mostly found in the Orf11ab gene. Eight (8) mutations were found in the Orf1ab region. These
mutations were 479th; T → A, 481th; C→A; 1015th; A → T, 2889th; C → T, 5098th; G → T; 5237th;
C → T, 5642th; G → T, 8023rd; G → A. The mutation 93rd; C → T was located in the 5’ upstream
region of the gene. The mutations 28733rd; G → A, 28734th; G → A and 28735th; G → C were
located in the N gene of the genome. 23255th; A → G mutation was located in the S gene of the
genome (Table 1). Among the thirteen (13) mutations, six (6) mutations, namely 93rd; C → T,
2889th; C → T, 23255th; A→G, 28733rd; G → A, 28734th; G → A and 28735th; G → C were

reported in different countries according to CNCB3 database (Table 1). All the variations showed
a missense effect upon structure except 2889th; C → T variant (Table 1). The other seven (7)
mutations, 479th; T → A, 481th; C→A; 1015th; A → T, 5098th; G → T; 5237th; C → T, 5642th; G
→ T and 8023rd; G → A presented themselves as unique mutations in the MT509958 genome
(Table 1 and Figure 2). Surprisingly, we didn’t find any mutation in SARS-CoV2/human/BGD/NIB-BCSIR_02/2020. We also looked for indel profile of our assembled genomes.
However, we did not find any insertion/deletion occurred into the genome. We looked for it in the
rest of the genomes of SARS-CoV-2 in Bangladesh. Seven (7) deletions were found in Bangladeshi
strains

EPI_ISL_468074,

EPI_ISL_514614,

EPI_ISL_445213, EPI_ISL_445217 and EPI_ISL_450842. Among them, EPI_ISL_450343,
EPI_ISL_450344, EPI_ISL_468074 and EPI_ISL_514614 shared common deletions. These
deletions belonged to the ORF8 gene and the length ranged from 27913 to 28254 (Table 2 and
Figure 3). We have found another deletion in the Orf7a gene whose position in the genome ranged
from 27476 to 27668. This was found in an isolate from Dhaka region of Bangladesh
(EPI_ISL_450842) (Figure 3).
Three (3) dimensional structures were built for both wild type and the mutants in order to observe
the mutational impact on their corresponding proteins (Figure 4). We have predicted the stability
of the protein structure of the corresponding variant based on energy minimization analysis. The
variants 479th; T → A and 1015th; A → T were the more stable compare to the other variants.
These variant’s structures consumed more energy than the wild type structure. The other variants
exhibited a decrease in stability (Table 3). The binding site of the protein structures was analyzed
to look for the location of the relevant amino acid variant. We have found that all the variants
were located within the ligand binding site (Figure 5). Therefore, these residues could be
considered very important in terms of ligand/drug binding. Ivermectin and Remdisivir were
selected for the drug binding analysis. We performed molecular docking for each of the wild type
and mutant structures with these two drugs and analyzed the interactions. We observed that the
interacting wild type residues were replaced with different residues in after molecular docking
with the drugs (Table 4). Here, the binding affinity was also found to be different from the wild
type structure. It is to be clearly understood that only a single amino acid change from the wild
type structure was responsible for these changes. From these analysis, it can be concluded that if

any therapeutics are to be applied on these variants, the therapeutics might not work effectively
due to the alteration of the residues in the mutant proteins.

Conclusions
To reiterate the core of our study, we have performed whole genome sequencing of SARS-CoV-2
to identify genetic variations and then analyzed their impact on the structures of their
corresponding proteins. We have also identified the insertions/deletions among all the sequenced
Bangladeshi SARS-CoV-2 strains. The energy minimization and the drug binding analysis
suggested that the identified mutations might have significant impact on structure and function of
their target proteins. Therefore, the present study might be of great interest to the
researchers/companies working to develop therapeutics against SARS-CoV-2 as well as gaining
fundamental insights into pathogenesis of the virus.
