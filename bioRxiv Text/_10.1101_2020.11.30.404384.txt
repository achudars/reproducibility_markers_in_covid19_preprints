Abstract
The SARS-CoV-2 main protease (Mpro ) is a crucial enzyme responsible for the maturation
of novel coronavirus, thus it serves as an excellent target for drug discovery. SARS-CoV-2 is
found to have similarity with SARS-CoV, which showed conformational changes upon varying
pH. There is no study till date on how pH change affect the conformtional flexibilty of SARSCoV-2 Mpro , therefore, we attempt to find the effect of pH variation through constant pH
molecular dynamics simulation studies. Protein is found to be most stable at neutral pH and
as pH turns basic protein structure becomes most destabilized. Acidic pH also tends to change
the structural properties of Mpro . Our study provides evidence that the flexibility of Mpro is
pH dependent like SARS-CoV Mpro .

Introduction

mains. Residues 10-99, 100-182 and 198-303 are
involved in the formation of domains 1,2 and 3,
respectively. Dimerization of Mpro is regulated
by domain 3. Catalytic dyad of the enzyme is
formed by residues His 41 and Cys145. Dimerization is necessary for the catalytic activity of
Mpro . 5,6 Due to its role in viral transcription
and replication, Mpro serves as an attractive target for drug designing. Many studies have been
carried out to identify the potential inhibitors
of Mpro . 7,8
Function of a protein is closely related to its
structure. As structure perturbs from native
conformation, its activity changes and under
drastic conditions protein may become functionally inactive. Various extraneous conditions like heat, concentration of like and unlike molecules around and pH of surrounding
etc affect the protein structure, therefore, their
effects are important to be examined on the protein of interest. Proteins are composed of various amino acids having acidic, basic, aliphatic,
polar and non-polar side chains. As pH of

COVID-19 is a severe respiratory illness caused
due to novel coronavirus, SARS-CoV-2 (severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus
2). 1 Coronaviruses belong to Nidovirales family, these are enveloped, positive-sense RNA
viruses, having very long genome around 30000
bases. 2 10 kilobases are used for structure and
accessory functions and 20 kilobases encode for
non-structural proteins. 2 The replicase gene encodes for the two overlapping polyproteins pp1a
and pp1ab, which are critical for replication and
transcription. These polyproteins are processed
extensively by virus proteinases and the functional proteins are released for carrying out the
virus replication. 3 Mpro also referred as 3CLpro ,
is a 33 kDa cysteine protease responsible for
cleaving and processing of viral polyproteins.
The structure of SARS-CoV-2 Mpro free enzyme
is recently solved by Zhou et al 4 at pH 7. Mpro is
a homodimeric protein, shown in Fig. 1. Structure of each monomer is comprised of three do1

Temperature of the system was slowly increased
from 10 K to 300 K over 400 ps under NVT
ensemble, followed by equilibration at constant
pressure for 4 ns. Berendsen barostat 16 was
used for maintaining constant pressure condition. The study utilized periodic boundary conditions and PME summation 17 for electrostatic
calculations.The shake methodology 18 was applied to restrict covalently bonded hydrogen
atoms. Time step of 2 femtosecond with 8
A0 cut off for non-bonded interactions were
applied. Convergence of energy, temperature
and density were monitored. Parallel to the
molecular dynamics simulation, the constant
pH method applied in pmemd through Monte
Carlo sampling of the Boltzmann distribution
of individual protonation states. Distribution
of protonation states is influenced by solvent
pH, which is set as an external parameter. A
total of five CpHMD simulations were run at pH
4, 5, 6, 7 and 8, by varying the solvent pH. All
the acidic aminoacids (ASP and GLU) are assumed to be deprotonated and basic aminoacids
(ARG, LYS and CYS) to be protonated in this
pH range. Protonation states of catalytic HIS
41 and CYS 145 were unchanged, all other
twelve histidines present in the protein were set
as titrable residues and their protonation states
are subjected to change by changing the partial charges on the atoms of titrable residues.
Production run was carried out for 100 ns, during production after every 100 steps protonation state change of every titrable residue was
attempted. GB salt concentration was set to
0.1 M.
Structural changes were seen through root
mean square deviation (RMSD) of backbone
atoms, which was calculated with respect to the
first frame structure. Residue wise fluctuations
were seen through root mean square fluctuation
(RMSF) which is time average RMSD. Surface
area of protein was calculated using LCPO algorithm by Weiser et al. 19 For calculating the
native contacts, 7 A0 cut off was set, active contacts were found to be present if the distance
between two C-alpha atoms were within 7 A0 at
any given time frame. Clustering analysis was
done using average linkage method, by keeping
epsilon equal to 1. The most populated cluster

in turn alters several interactions and give protein a distinct structure. Effect of pH was
seen on the structure of SARS-CoV Mpro by
Jinzhi et al., 9 their study showed that the conformational flexibility of Mpro is pH dependent.

study of SARS-CoV-2 Mpro structure has been
conducted, therefore, in our study, we have seen
the effect of pH alteration, ranging from acidic
to basic pH, on the structure of SARS-CoV2 main protease (Mpro ) through constant pH
molecular dynamics simulations (CpHMD).

Simulation Details

All atom constant pH molecular dynamics
(CpHMD) simulations 11,12 were performed using AMBER18 13 and amberff10 14 force field
was used for deriving the bonded and nonbonded parameters. Initial structure of protein was obtained from RCSB (PDB: 6y2e 4 )
and protein was solvated using TIP3P 15 water
molecules inside trucated octahedron box of 18
nm. Charges on the protein were neutralized by
adding counter ions. Energy minimization was
carried out using 1000 steps of steepest descent
followed by 4000 steps of conjugate gradient
method, keeping backbone atoms restrained.

3.1

Contribution of each residue towards the total structural deviation was seen through root
mean square fluctuation (RMSF) analysis,
Fig. 3(a)-3(b). At pH 4, larger fluctuations
were seen for residues 117-123, 141-143, 196199, 209-216, 226-263, 280-288 and 293-301
in chain A, comparatively smaller fluctuations
were seen in chain B. At pH 5, residues 5052, 72, 96-97, 184-187 and 299 of chain A and
residues 1, 45-51, 140, 155, 167-170, 189-196,
216-218, 270-274, 304-306 of chain B showed
more changes. At pH 6, residue 1-3, 59-65, 109112, 128-129, 132, 138-139, 154-156, 195-203,

58-65, 118-120, 168-169, 244-258 and 305-306
of chain B were shown to be more fluctuating.
Fluctuations were found be minimum in both

Results and Discussion
Root Mean Square Deviation

The change in protonation states bring about
local fluctuations in protein which then contribute to overall dynamical changes in protein,
therefore to see these changes, root mean square
deviation (RMSD) was monitored throghout
the simulation, as shown in Fig. 2(a). Initially,
RMSD values increased slowly at all the pH
values but a sudden increase in RMSD was observed at pH 8 around 50 ns (1 ns=500 frames),
which kept on increasing till 80 ns and became
constant after that. For a better understanding,
probability distribution curve of each RMSD
value was constructed, (Fig. 2(b)), two peaks
were observed around 1.8 A0 , 2.3 A0 at pH 4
and around 2.4 A0 , 2.9 A0 at pH 8. For pH 5,
6 and 7 RMSD values having maximum probablities were observed at 2.2 A0 , 1.9 A0 and 2
A0 , respectively. From RMSD analysis, it can
be seen that at pH 4 and pH 8 protein sampled
large number of conformations and fluctuations
were maximum at pH 8, minimum at pH 7.

the chains at pH 7 as compared to that of at
other pH values. At pH 8, chain A showed relatively lesser fluctuations as compared to chain
B. In chain A, residues 1-2, 52-53, 138, 183-185,
192, 194, 274 and 19-27, 39-90, 116-122, 137146, 167-172, 176-180, 183, 191-192, 226-229,
231-233 and 275-276 residues in chain B were
largely destabilized. At pH 4, mainly domain 3
of chain A was destabilized with highest RMSF
values. As pH increases from 4 to 5, fluctuations were also observed in domains 1 and 3.
At pH 6, destabilization in all three domains
became dominant and increased even more at
pH 8. Fluctuations in domain 1 and 2 affects
substrate binding to Mpro and in domain 3 affect

maximum decrease in contacts was observed,
Fig. 4(c). At pH 7, only slight changes in native contacts were observed. From probability
distribution curve, native contacts were found
to be highest, 2220, at pH 7. At pH 4, 2170
native contacts were present. At pH 5, 6 and
8, a broad distribution of native contacts was
seen, with increase in contacts from pH 5 to 6
and least number of native contacts were there
at pH 8, Fig. 4(d). Surface area was found to be
minimum and native contacts were found to be
maximum at pH7, implying that the structure
of Mpro is most stable at neutral pH.

dimerization. Above observations suggest that
all the important domains of Mpro namely, 1,2
and 3 gets destabilized as pH becomes acidic or
basic.

Solvent Accessible Surface
Area and Native Contacts

Solvent accessible surface area (SASA) and
number of native contacts can be used to monitor the proper folding of protein, therefore,
these were calculated at all the pH (Fig. 4). At
pH 4, 5 and 7, only a small change in SASA
was observed with time, most probable values of SASA were equal to 267.37 nm2 , 269.31
nm2 and 261.982 , respectively. At pH 6, SASA
started increasing around 20 ns and kept on increasing till 100 ns, with two peaks at 264.27
and 275 nm2 in probability plot. At pH 8, value
of SASA first decreased and then started increasing again after 20 ns, a wide probability
distribution of SASA was obtained with 270.78
nm2 having maximum probability.

Distance Analysis

Dimerization of main protease is essential for its
activity (because the N-finger of each of the two
protomers interacts with Glu166 of the other
protomer and thereby helps shape the S1 pocket
of substrate binding site), its monomeric state
is not active. Substrate binding site of enzyme
is shaped through the interaction of N-finger of
one monomer and Glu166 of another monomer,
therefore, distance between residues Ser1 and
Glu166 was monitored to ensure intact dimer
formation throughout the simulation at all pH
values, Fig. 5(a). At pH 7, distance between

Ser1 and Glu166 was remained constant at all
time frames. At pH 4, 5 and 6, this distance increased with time and value fluctuated between
8 A0 and 12 A0 . At pH 8, distance started increasing after 20 ns and a sudden increase was
observed around 45 ns followed by a constant

In the beginning, native contacts were around

fluctuation around 16 A0 at all frames. Similarly, in probability histogram multiple peaks
are observed at pH 4, 5, 6 and 8, however, a single peak was observed at pH 7, Fig. 5(b), which
suggests that dimerization process is weak at
acidic and basic pH.

Clustering Analysis and Orientation of Substrate Binding Pocket

Conflict of Interest

There is no conflict of interest.

From clustering analysis, representative structures of the most populated clusters were obtained at all pH values. Proper orientation
of active site residues is necessary for protein
to carry out its function. The active sites, of
the obtained structures of Mpro from clustering,
were compared, Fig. 6(a)-6(e). His 41 and Cys
145 forms the catalytic dyad of protein, their
proper orientation was observed only at pH 7,
Fig. 6(d). At all the pH other than pH 7, N2 of
His 41 was not found to be orienting towards SÎ³
of Cys 145, as shown in Fig. 6(a), 6(b), 6(c) and
6(e). Thus, the orientation of catalytic dyad of
Mpro S1 binding pocket also gets affected by pH.

Our study has demonstrated that structure of
SARS-CoV-2 main protease (Mpro ) shows pH
dependence. At basic pH (pH 8), the structure of Mpro was found to be least stable and as
pH becomes more acidic, structure of Mpro gets
destabilized.The structure of Mpro showed maximum stability at neutral pH. At all the pH other
than neutral pH, dimerization and S1 binding
pocket were found to be affected. Our study
throws light on how an environmental factor
like pH can affect the integrity of active site
of Mpro and encourage researchers to explore the
small molecules that can modulate the intracellular pH to prevent the replication by lowering
the activity of Mpro .
