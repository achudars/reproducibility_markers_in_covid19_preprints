Abstract
As of February 20, 2020, the 2019 novel coronavirus (renamed to COVID-19) spread to
30 countries with 2130 deaths and more than 75500 confirmed cases. COVID-19 is
being compared to the infamous SARS coronavirus, which resulted, between November
2002 and July 2003, in 8098 confirmed cases worldwide with a 9.6% death rate and 774
deaths. Though COVID-19 has a death rate of 2.8% as of 20 February, the 75752
confirmed cases in a few weeks (December 8, 2019 to February 20, 2020) are alarming,
with cases likely being under-reported given the comparatively longer incubation period.
Such outbreaks demand elucidation of taxonomic classification and origin of the virus
genomic sequence, for strategic planning, containment, and treatment. This paper
identifies an intrinsic COVID-19 genomic signature and uses it together with a machine
learning-based alignment-free approach for an ultra-fast, scalable, and highly accurate
classification of whole COVID-19 genomes. The proposed method combines supervised
machine learning with digital signal processing for genome analyses, augmented by a
decision tree approach to the machine learning component, and a Spearman’s rank
correlation coefficient analysis for result validation. These tools are used to analyze a
large dataset of over 5000 unique viral genomic sequences, totalling 61.8 million bp. Our
results support a hypothesis of a bat origin and classify COVID-19 as Sarbecovirus,
within Betacoronavirus. Our method achieves high levels of classification accuracy and
discovers the most relevant relationships among over 5,000 viral genomes within a few
minutes, ab initio, using raw DNA sequence data alone, and without any specialized
biological knowledge, training, gene or genome annotations. This suggests that, for
novel viral and pathogen genome sequences, this alignment-free whole-genome
machine-learning approach can provide a reliable real-time option for taxonomic
classification.

Introduction

Coronaviruses are single-stranded positive-sense RNA viruses that are known to contain
some of the largest viral genomes, up to around 32 kbp in length [1–5]. After increases

in the number of coronavirus genome sequences available following efforts to investigate
the diversity in the wild, the family Coronaviridae now contains four genera
(International Committee on Taxonomy of Viruses, [6]). While those species that belong
to the genera Alphacoronavirus and Betacoronavirus can infect mammalian hosts, those
in Gammacoronavirus and the recently defined Deltacoronavirus mainly infect avian
species [4, 7–9]. Phylogenetic studies have revealed a complex evolutionary history, with
coronaviruses thought to have ancient origins and recent crossover events that can lead
to cross-species infection [8, 10–12]. Some of the largest sources of diversity for
coronaviruses belong to the strains that infect bats and birds, providing a reservoir in
wild animals for recombination and mutation that may enable cross-species transmission
into other mammals and humans [4, 7, 8, 10, 13].
Like other RNA viruses, coronavirus genomes are known to have genomic plasticity,
and this can be attributed to several major factors. RNA-dependent RNA polymerases
(RdRp) have high mutation rates, reaching from 1 in 1000 to 1 in 10000 nucleotides
during replication [7, 14, 15]. Coronaviruses are also known to use a template switching
mechanism which can contribute to high rates of homologous RNA recombination
between their viral genomes [9, 16–20]. Furthermore, the large size of coronavirus
genomes is thought to be able to accommodate mutations to genes [7]. These factors
help contribute to the plasticity and diversity of coronavirus genomes today.
The highly pathogenic human coronaviruses, Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome
coronavirus (SARS-CoV) and Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus
(MERS-CoV) belong to lineage B (sub-genus Sarbecovirus) and lineage C (sub-genus
Merbecovirus) of Betacoronavirus, respectively [9, 21–23]. Both result from zoonotic
transmission to humans and lead to symptoms of viral pneumonia, including fever,
breathing difficulties, and more [24, 25]. Recently, an unidentified pneumonia disease
with similar symptoms caused an outbreak in Wuhan and is thought to have started
from a local fresh seafood market [26–30]. This was later attributed to a novel
coronavirus deemed COVID-19 and represents the third major zoonotic human
coronavirus of this century [31]. As of February 20, confirmed cases have risen to 75752
globally, with infections reported in 30 countries [32]. As a result, the World Health
Organization set the risk assessment to “Very High” for China, where the bulk of the
cases are contained and “High” for regional and global levels [33]. Initiatives to identify
the source of transmission and possible intermediate animal vectors have commenced
since the genome sequence became publicly available.
From analyses employing whole genome to viral protein-based comparisons, the
COVID-19 strain is thought to belong to lineage B (Sarbecovirus) of Betacoronavirus.
From phylogenetic analysis of the RdRp protein, spike proteins, and full genomes of
COVID-19 and other coronaviruses, it was found that COVID-19 is most closely related
to two bat SARS-like coronaviruses, bat-SL-CoVZXC21 and bat-SL-CoVZC45, found in
Chinese horseshoe bats Rhinolophus sinicus [12, 34–38]. Along with the phylogenetic
data, the genome organization of COVID-19 was found to be typical of lineage B
(Sarbecovirus) Betacoronaviruses [34]. From phylogenetic analysis of full genome
alignment and similarity plots, it was found that COVID-19 has the highest similarity
to the bat coronavirus RaTG13 [39]. Close associations to bat coronavirus RaTG13 and
two bat SARS-like CoVs (ZC45 and ZXC21) are also supported in alignment-based
phylogenetic analyses [39]. Within the COVID-19 strains, over 99% sequence similarity
and a lack of diversity within these strains suggest a common lineage and source, with
support for recent emergence of the human strain [12, 31]. There is still ongoing debate
whether the COVID-19 strain arose following recombination with previously identified
bat and unknown coronaviruses [40] or arose independently as a new lineage to infect
humans [39]. In combination with the identification that the angiotensin converting
enzyme 2 (ACE2) protein is a receptor for COVID-19, as it is for SARS and other

Sarbecovirus strains, the hypothesis that COVID-19 originated from bats is deemed very
likely [12, 34, 36, 39, 42–45].
All analyses performed thus far have been alignment-based and rely on the
annotations of the viral genes. Though alignment-based methods have been successful in
finding sequence similarities, their application can be challenging in many cases [46, 47].
It is realistically impossible to analyze thousands of complete genomes using
alignment-based methods due to the heavy computation time. Moreover, the alignment
demands the sequences to be continuously homologous which is not always the case.
Alignment-free methods [48–52] have been proposed in the past as an alternative to
address the limitations of the alignment-based methods. Comparative genomics beyond
alignment-based approaches have benefited from the computational power of machine
learning. Machine learning-based alignment-free methods have also been used
successfully for a variety of problems including virus classification [50–52]. An
alignment-free approach [50] was proposed for subtype classification of HIV-1 genomes
and achieved ∼ 97% classification accuracy. MLDSP [51], with the use of a broad range
of 1D numerical representations of DNA sequences, has also achieved very high levels of
classification accuracy with viruses. Even rapidly evolving, plastic genomes of viruses
such as Influenza and Dengue are classified down to the level of strain and subtype,
respectively with 100% classification accuracy. MLDSP-GUI [52] provides an option to
use 2D Chaos Game Representation (CGR) [53] as numerical representation of DNA
sequences. CGR’s have a longstanding use in species classification with identification of
biases in sequence composition [49, 52, 53]. MLDSP-GUI has shown 100% classification
accuracy for Flavivirus genus to species classification using 2D CGR as numerical
representation [52]. MLDSP and MLDSP-GUI have demonstrated the ability to identify
the genomic signatures (a species-specific pattern known to be pervasive throughout the
genome) with species level accuracy that can be used for sequence (dis)similarity
analyses. In this study, we use MLDSP [51] and MLDSP-GUI [52] with CGR as a
numerical representation of DNA sequences to assess the classification of COVID-19
from the perspective of machine learning-based alignment-free whole genome
comparison of genomic signatures. Using MLDSP and MLDSP-GUI, we confirm that
the COVID-19 belongs to the Betacoronavirus, while its genomic similarity to the
sub-genus Sarbecovirus supports a possible bat origin.
This paper shows how machine learning using intrinsic genomic signatures can
provide rapid alignment-free taxonomic classification of novel pathogens. Our method
delivers accurate classifications of COVID-19 without a priori biological knowledge, by
a simultaneous processing of the geometric space of all relevant viral genomes. The
main contributions are:
• Identifying intrinsic viral genomic signatures, and utilizing them for a real-time
and highly accurate machine learning-based classification of novel pathogen
sequences, such as COVID-19;
• A general-purpose bare-bones approach, which uses raw DNA sequences alone and
does not have any requirements for gene or genome annotation;
• The use of a “decision tree” approach to supervised machine learning (paralleling
taxonomic ranks), for successive refinements of taxonomic classification.
• A comprehensive and “in minutes” analysis of a dataset of 5538 unique viral
genomic sequences, for a total of 61.8 million bp analyzed, with high classification
accuracy scores at all levels, from the highest to the lowest taxonomic rank;
• The use of Spearman’s rank correlation analysis to confirm our results and the
relatedness of the COVID-19 sequences to the known genera of the family
Coronaviridae and the known sub-genera of the genus Betacoronavirus.

The Wuhan seafood market pneumonia virus (COVID-19 virus) isolate Wuhan-Hu-1
complete reference genome of 29903 bp was downloaded from the NCBI database on
January 23, 2020. Also, we downloaded all of the available 29 sequences of COVID-19
and the bat Betacoronavirus RaTG13 from the GISAID platform and two additional
sequences (bat-SL-CoVZC45, and bat-SL-CoVZXC21) from the NCBI on January 27,
2019. We downloaded all of the available viral sequences from the Virus-Host DB
(14688 sequences available on January 14, 2020). Virus-Host DB covers the sequences
from the NCBI RefSeq (release 96, September 9, 2019), and GenBank (release 233.0,
August 15, 2019). All sequences shorter than 2000 bp and longer than 50000 bp were
ignored to address possible issues arising from sequence length bias.
ML-DSP [51] and MLDSP-GUI [52] were used as the machine learning-based
alignment-free methods for complete genome analyses. As MLDSP-GUI is an extension
of the ML-DSP methodology, we will refer to the method hereafter as MLDSP-GUI.
Each genomic sequence is mapped into its respective genomic signal (a discrete numeric
sequence) using a numerical representation. For this study, we use a two-dimensional
k-mer (oligomers of length k) based numerical representation known as Chaos Game
Representation (CGR) [53]. The k-mer value 7 is used for all the experiments. The
value k = 7 achieved the highest accuracy scores for the HIV-1 subtype
classification [50] and this value could be relevant for other virus related analyses. The
magnitude spectra are then calculated by applying Discrete Fourier Transform (DFT)
to the genomic signals [51]. A pairwise distance matrix is then computed using the
Pearson Correlation Coefficient (PCC) [54] as a distance measure between magnitude
spectra. The distance matrix is used to generate the 3D Molecular Distance Maps
(MoDMap3D) [55] by applying the classical Multi-Dimensional Scaling (MDS) [56].
MoDMap3D represents an estimation of the relationship among sequences based on the
genomic distances between the sequences. The feature vectors are constructed from the
columns of the distance matrix and are used as an input to train six supervised-learning
based classification models (Linear Discriminant, Linear SVM, Quadratic SVM, Fine
KNN, Subspace Discriminant, and Subspace KNN) [51]. A 10-fold cross-validation is
used to train, and test the classification models and the average of 10 runs is reported
as the classification accuracy. The trained machine learning models are then used to
test the COVID-19 sequences. The unweighted pair group method with arithmetic
mean (UPGMA) phylogenetic tree is also computed using the pairwise distance matrix.
In this paper, MLDSP-GUI is augmented by a decision tree approach to the
supervised machine learning component and a Spearman’s rank correlation coefficient
analysis for result validation. The decision tree parallels the taxonomic classification
levels, and is necessary so as to minimize the number of calls to the supervised classifier
module, as well as to maintain a reasonable number of clusters during each supervised
training session. For validation of MLDSP-GUI results using CGR as a numerical
representation, we use Spearman’s rank correlation coefficient [57–60], as follows. The
frequency of each k-mer is calculated in each genome. Due to differences in genome
length between species, proportional frequencies are computed by dividing each k-mer
frequency by the length of the respective sequence. To determine whether there is a
correlation between k-mer frequencies in COVID-19 and specific taxonomic groups, a
Spearman’s rank correlation coefficient test is conducted for k = 1 to k = 7.

sequences), the respective sequence length statistics, and results of MLDSP-GUI after
applying 10-fold cross-validation as classification accuracy scores are shown. The
classification accuracy scores for all six classification models are shown with their
average, see Table 1.
As shown in Table 1, for the first test (Test-1), we organized the dataset of
sequences into 12 clusters (11 families, and Riboviria realm). Only the families with at
least 100 sequences were considered. The Riboviria cluster contains all families that
belong to the realm Riboviria. For the clusters with more than 500 sequences, we
selected 500 sequences at random. Our method can handle all of the available 14668
sequences, but using imbalanced clusters, in regard to the number of sequences, can
introduce an unwanted bias. After filtering out the sequences, our pre-processed dataset
is left with 3273 sequences organized into 12 clusters (Adenoviridae, Anelloviridae,
Caudovirales, Geminiviridae, Genomoviridae, Microviridae, Ortervirales,
Papillomaviridae, Parvoviridae, Polydnaviridae, Polyomaviridae, and Riboviria). We
used MLDSP-GUI with CGR as the numerical representation at k = 7. The maximum
classification accuracy of 94.9% is obtained using the Quadratic SVM model. The
respective MoDMap3D is shown in Figure 1(a). All six classification models trained on
3273 sequences were used to classify (predict the label of) the 29 COVID-19 sequences.
All of our machine learning-based models correctly predicted and confirmed the label as
Riboviria for all 29 sequences (Table 2).
Test-1 classified the COVID-19 virus as belonging to the realm Riboviria. The
second test (Test-2) is designed to classify COVID-19 among the families of the
Riboviria realm. We completed the dataset pre-processing using the same rules as in
Test-1 and obtained a dataset of 2779 sequences placed into the 12 families
(Betaflexiviridae, Bromoviridae, Caliciviridae, Coronaviridae, Flaviviridae,
Peribunyaviridae, Phenuiviridae, Picornaviridae, Potyviridae, Reoviridae, Rhabdoviridae,
and Secoviridae), see Table 1. MLDSP-GUI with CGR at k = 7 as the numerical
representation was used for the classification of the dataset in Test-2. The maximum
classification accuracy of 93.1% is obtained using the Quadratic SVM model. The
respective MoDMap3D is shown in Figure 1(b). All six classification models trained on
2779 sequences were used to classify (predict the label of) the 29 COVID-19 sequences.
All of our machine learning-based models predicted the label as Coronaviridae for all 29
sequences (Table 2) with 100% classification accuracy. Test-2 correctly predicted the
family of COVID-19 sequences as Coronaviridae. Test-3 performs the genus-level
classification.

The third test (Test-3a) is designed to classify the COVID-19 sequences at the genus
level. We considered 208 Coronaviridae sequences available under four genera
(Alphacoronavirus, Betacoronavirus, Deltacoronavirus, Gammacoronavirus) (Table 1).
MLDSP-GUI with CGR at k = 7 as the numerical representation was used for the
classification of the dataset in Test-3a. The maximum classification accuracy of 98.1% is
obtained using the Linear Discriminant model and the respective MoDMap3D is shown
in Figure 1(c). All six classification models trained on 208 sequences were used to
classify (predict the label of) the 29 COVID-19 sequences. All of our machine
learning-based models predicted the label as Betacoronavirus for all 29 sequences (Table
2). To verify that the correct prediction is not an artifact of possible bias because of
larger Betacoronavirus cluster, we did a secondary Test-3b with cluster size limited to
the size of smallest cluster (after removing the Gammacoronavirus because it just had 9
sequences). The maximum classification accuracy of 100% is obtained using the Linear
Discriminant model for Test-3b. All six classification models trained on 60 sequences
were used to classify the 29 COVID-19 sequences. All of our machine learning-based
models predicted the label as Betacoronavirus for all 29 sequences (Table 2). This
secondary test showed that the possible bias is not significant enough to have any
impact on the classification performance.
Given confirmation that the COVID-19 belongs to the Betacoronavirus genus, there
now is a question of its origin and relation to the other viruses of the same genus. To
examine this question, we preprocessed our dataset from our third test to keep the
sub-clusters of the Betacoronavirus with at least 10 sequences (Test-4). This gives 124
sequences placed into four clusters (Embecovirus, Merbecovirus, Nobecovirus,
Sarbecovirus) (Table 3). The maximum classification accuracy of 98.4% with CGR at
k = 7 as the numerical representation is obtained using the Quadratic SVM model. The
respective MoDMap3D is shown in Figure 2(a). All six classifiers trained on 124
sequences predicted the label as Sarbecovirus, when used to predict the labels of 29
COVID-19 sequences. For Test-5, we added COVID-19 with 29 sequences as the fifth
cluster, see Table 3. The maximum classification accuracy of 98.7% with CGR at k = 7
as the numerical representation is obtained using the Subspace Discriminant model. The
respective MoDMap3D is shown in Figure 2(b). In the MoDMap3D plot from Test-5,
COVID-19 sequences are placed in a single distinct cluster, see Figure 2(b). As visually
suggested by the MoDMap3D (Figure 2(b)), the average inter-cluster distances confirm
that the COVID-19 sequences are closest to the Sarbecovirus (average distance 0.0556),
followed by Merbecovirus (0.0746), Embecovirus (0.0914), and Nobecovirus (0.0916). The
three closest sequences based on the average distances from all COVID-19 sequences are
RaTG13 (0.0203), bat-SL-CoVZC45 (0.0418), and bat-SL-CoVZXC21 (0.0428).
For Test-6, we classified Sarbecovirus (47 sequences) and COVID-19 (29 sequences)
clusters and achieved separation of the two clusters visually apparent in the
MoDMap3D, see Figure 2(c). Quantitatively, using 10-fold cross-validation, all six of
our classifiers report 100% classification accuracy. We generated a phylogenetic tree
based on all pairwise distances for the dataset in Test-6 that shows the separation of the
two clusters and relationships within the clusters (Figure 3). As observed in Test-5, the
phylogenetic tree shows that the COVID-19 sequences are closer to the bat
Betacoronavirus RaTG13 sequence collected from a bat host.

The Spearman’s rank correlation coefficient tests were used to further confirm the
ML-DSP findings. The first test in Figure 5 shows the COVID-19 being compared to
the four genera; Alphacoronavirus, Betacoronavirus, Gammacoronavirus and
Deltacoronavirus. The COVID-19 showed the highest k-mer frequency correlation to
Betacoronavirus at k = 7 (Table 4), which is consistent with the ML-DSP results in
Test-3 (Table 2). The COVID-19 was then compared to all sub-genera within the
Betacoronavirus genus: Embecovirus, Merbecovirus, Nobecovirs and Sarbecovirus seen in
Figure 6. The Spearman’s rank test was again consistent with the ML-DSP results seen
in Table 3, as the k-mer frequencies at k = 7 showed the highest correlation to the
sub-genus Sarbecovirus (Table 4). These tests confirm the findings in ML-DSP and are
consistent with the COVID-19 virus as part of the sub-genus Sarbecovirus.

Discussion

Prior work elucidating the evolutionary history of the Wuhan COVID-19 virus had
suggested an origin from bats prior to zoonotic transmission [12, 34, 36, 39, 42, 61]. Most
early cases of individuals infected with COVID-19 had contact with the Huanan South
China Seafood Market [26–31]. Human-to-human transmission is confirmed, further
highlighting the need for continued intervention [34, 61–63]. Still, the early COVID-19
genomes that have been sequenced and uploaded are over 99% similar, suggesting these
infections result from a recent cross-species event [12, 31, 41].
These prior analyses relied upon alignment-based methods to identify relationships
between COVID-19 and other coronaviruses with nucleotide and amino acid sequence
similarities. When analyzing the conserved replicase domains of ORF1ab for
coronavirus species classification, nearly 94% of amino acid residues were identical to
SARS-CoV, yet overall genome similarity was only around 70%, confirming that
COVID-19 was genetically different [63]. Within the RdRp region, it was found that
another bat coronavirus, RaTG13, was the closest relative to COVID-19 and formed a
distinct lineage from other bat SARS-like coronaviruses [39, 41]. Other groups found
that two bat SARS-like coronaviruses, bat-SL-CoVZC45 and bat-SL-CoVZXC21, were
also closely related to COVID-19 [12, 34–38]. There is a consensus that these three bat
viruses are most similar to COVID-19, however, whether or not COVID-19 arose from a
recombination event is still unknown [39–41].
Regardless of the stance on recombination, current consensus holds that the
hypothesis of COVID-19 originating from bats is highly likely. Bats have been identified
as a reservoir of mammalian viruses and cross-species transmission to other mammals,
including humans [4, 7, 8, 10, 13, 64–66]. Prior to intermediary cross-species infection, the
coronaviruses SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV were also thought to have originated in
bats [24, 25, 35, 68, 69]. Many novel SARS-like coronaviruses have been discovered in
bats across China, and even in European, African and other Asian countries [35, 70–76].
With widespread geographic coverage, SARS-like coronaviruses have likely been present
in bats for a long period of time and novel strains of these coronaviruses can arise
through recombination [4]. Whether or not COVID-19 was transmitted directly from
bats, or from intermediary hosts, is still unknown, and will require identification of
COVID-19 in species other than humans, notably from the wet market and surrounding
area it is thought to have originated from [30]. While bats have been reported to have
been sold at the Huanan market, at this time, it is still unknown if there were
intermediary hosts involved prior to transmission to humans [27, 31, 34, 40, 77]. Snakes
had been proposed as an intermediary host for COVID-19 based on relative synonymous

codon usage bias studies between viruses and their hosts [40], however, this claim has
been disputed [78]. China CDC released information about environmental sampling in
the market and indicated that 33 of 585 samples had evidence of COVID-19, with 31 of
these positive samples taken from the location where wildlife booths were concentrated,
suggesting possible wildlife origin [79, 80]. Detection of SARS-CoV in Himalyan palm
civets and horseshoe bats identified 29 nucleotide sequences that helped trace the origins
of SARS-CoV isolates in humans to these intermediary species [13, 24, 39, 76]. Sampling
additional animals at the market and wildlife in the surrounding area may help elucidate
whether intermediary species were involved or not, as was possible with the SARS-CoV.
Viral outbreaks like COVID-19 demand timely analysis of genomic sequences to
guide the research in the right direction. This problem being time-sensitive requires
quick sequence similarity comparison against thousands of known sequences to narrow
down the candidates of possible origin. Alignment-based methods are known to be
time-consuming and can be challenging in cases where homologous sequence continuity
cannot be ensured. It is challenging (and sometimes impossible) for alignment-based
methods to compare a large number of sequences that are too different in their
composition. Alignment-free methods have been used successfully in the past to address
the limitations of the alignment-based methods [49–52]. The alignment-free approach is
quick and can handle a large number of sequences. Moreover, even the sequences
coming from different regions with different compositions can be easily compared
quantitatively, with equally meaningful results as when comparing homologous/similar
sequences. We use MLDSP-GUI (a variant of MLDSP with additional features), a
machine learning-based alignment-free method successfully used in the past for sequence
comparisons and analyses [51]. The main advantage alignment-free methodology offers
is the ability to analyze large datasets rapidly. In this study we confirm the taxonomy
of COVID-19 and, more generally, propose a method to efficiently analyze and classify a
novel unclassified DNA sequence against the background of a large dataset. We namely
use a “decision tree” approach (paralleling taxonomic ranks), and start with the highest
taxonomic level, train the classification models on the available complete genomes, test
the novel unknown sequences to predict the label among the labels of the training
dataset, move to the next taxonomic level, and repeat the whole process down to the
lowest taxonomic label.
Test-1 starts at the highest available level and classifies the viral sequences to the 11
families and Riboviria realm (Table 1). There is only one realm available in the viral
taxonomy, so all of the families that belong to the realm Riboviria are placed into a
single cluster and a random collection of 500 sequences are selected. No realm is defined
for the remaining 11 families. The objective is to train the classification models with the
known viral genomes and then predict the labels of the COVID-19 virus sequences. The
maximum classification accuracy score of 95% was obtained using the Quadratic SVM
model. This test demonstrates that MLDSP-GUI can distinguish between different viral
families. The trained models are then used to predict the labels of 29 COVID-19
sequences. As expected, all classification models correctly predict that the COVID-19
sequences belong to the Riboviria realm, see Table 2. Test-2 is composed of 12 families
from the Riboviria, see Table 1, and the goal is to test if MLDSP-GUI is sensitive
enough to classify the sequences at the next lower taxonomic level. It should be noted
that as we move down the taxonomic levels, sequences become much more similar to
one another and the classification problem becomes challenging. MLDSP-GUI is still
able to distinguish between the sequences within the Riboviria realm with a maximum
classification accuracy of 91.1% obtained using the Linear Discriminant classification
model. When COVID-19 sequences are tested using the models trained on Test-2, all of
the models correctly predict the COVID-19 sequences as Coronaviridae (Table 2).
Test-3a moves down another taxonomic level and classifies the Coronaviridae family to

four genera (Alphacoronavirus, Betacoronavirus, Deltacoronavirus, Gammacoronavirus),
see Table 1. MLDSP-GUI distinguishes sequences at the genus level with a maximum
classification accuracy score of 98%, obtained using the Linear Discriminant model. This
is a very high accuracy rate considering that no alignment is involved and the sequences
are very similar. All trained classification models correctly predict the COVID-19 as
Betacoronavirus, see Table 2. Test-3a has Betacoronavirus as the largest cluster and it
can be argued that the higher accuracy could be a result of this bias. To avoid bias, we
did an additional test removing the smallest cluster Gammacoronavirus and limiting the
size of remaining three clusters to the size of the cluster with the minimum number of
sequences i.e. 20 with Test-3b. MLDSP-GUI obtains 100% classification accuracy for
this additional test and still predicts all of the COVID-19 sequences as Betacoronavirus.
These tests confirm that the COVID-19 are from the genus Betacoronavirus.
Sequences become very similar at lower taxonomic levels (sub-genera and species).
Test-4, Test-5, and Test-6 investigate within the genus Betacoronavirus for sub-genus
classification. Test-4 is designed to classify Betacoronavirus into the four sub-genera
(Embecovirus, Merbecovirus, Nobecovirus, Sarbecovirus), see Table 3. MLDSP-GUI
distinguishes sequences at the sub-genus level with a maximum classification accuracy
score of 98.4%, obtained using the Quadratic SVM model. All of the classification
models trained on the dataset in Test-4 predicted the label of all 29 COVID-19
sequences as Sarbecovirus. This suggests substantial similarity between COVID-19 and
the Sarbecovirus sequences. Test-5 and Test-6 (see Table 3) are designed to verify that
COVID-19 sequences can be differentiated from the known species in the
Betacoronavirus genus. MLDSP-GUI achieved a maximum classification score of 98.7%
for Test-5 and 100% for Test-6 using Subspace Discriminant classification model. This
shows that although COVID-19 and Sarbecovirus are closer on the basis of genomic
similarity (Test-4), they are still distinguishable from known species. Therefore, these
results suggest that COVID-19 may represent a genetically distinct species of
Sarbecovirus. All COVID-19 virues are visually seen in MoDMap3D generated from
Test-5 (see Figure 2(b)) as a closely packed cluster and it supports a fact that there is
99% similarity among these sequences [12, 31]. The MoDMap3D generated from the
Test-5 (Figure 2(b)) visually suggests and the average distances from COVID-19
sequences to all other sequences confirm that the COVID-19 sequences are most
proximal to the RaTG13 (distance: 0.0203), followed by the bat-SL-CoVZC45 (0.0418),
and bat-SL-CoVZX21 (0.0428). To confirm this proximity, a UPGMA phylogenetic tree
is computed from the PCC-based pairwise distance matrix of sequences in Test-6, see
Figure 3. The phylogenetic tree placed the RaTG13 sequence closest to the COVID-19
sequences, followed by the bat-SL-CoVZC45 and bat-SL-CoVZX21 sequences. This
closer proximity represents the smaller genetic distances between these sequences and
aligns with the visual sequence relationships shown in the MoDMap3D of Figure 2(b).
We further confirm our results regarding the closeness of COVID-19 with the
sequences from the Betacoronavirus genus (especially sub-genus Sarbecovirus) by a
quantitative analysis based on the Spearman’s rank correlation coefficient tests.
Spearman’s rank correlation coefficient [57–60] tests were applied to the frequencies of
oligonucleotide segments, adjusting for the total number of segments, to measure the
degree and statistical significance of correlation between two sets of genomic sequences.
Spearman’s ρ value provides the degree of correlation between the two groups and their
k-mer frequencies. The COVID-19 virus was compared to all genera under the
Coronaviridae family and the k-mer frequencies showed the strongest correlation to the
genus Betacoronavirus, and more specifically Sarbecovirus. The Spearman’s rank tests
corroborate that the COVID-19 virus is part of the Sarbecovirus sub-genus, as shown by
CGR and ML-DSP. When analyzing sub-genera, it could be hard to classify at lower k
values due to the short oligonucleotide frequencies not capturing enough information to

highlight the distinctions. Therefore despite the Spearman’s rank correlation coefficient
providing results for k = 1 to k = 7, the higher k-mer lengths provided more accurate
results, and k = 7 was used.
Attributes of the COVID-19 genomic signature are consistent with previously
reported mechanisms of innate immunity operating in bats as a host reservoir for
coronaviruses. Vertebrate genomes are known to have an under-representation of CG
dinucleotides in their genomes, otherwise known as CG suppression [81, 82]. This feature
is thought to have been due to the accumulation of spontaneous deamination mutations
of methyl-cytosines over time [81]. As viruses are obligate parasites, evolution of viral
genomes is intimately tied to the biology of their hosts [83]. As host cells develop
strategies such as RNA interference and restriction-modification systems to prevent and
limit viral infections, viruses will continue to counteract these strategies [82–84].
Dinucleotide composition and biases are pervasive across the genome and make up a
part of the organism’s genomic signature [83]. These host genomes have evolutionary
pressures that shape the host genomic signature, such as the pressure to eliminate CG
dinucleotides within protein coding genes in humans [82]. Viral genomes have been
shown to mimic the same patterns of the hosts, including single-stranded positive-sense
RNA viruses, which suggests that many RNA viruses can evolve to mimic the same
features of their host’s genes and genomic signature [81–85]. As genomic composition,
specifically in mRNA, can be used as a way of discriminating self vs non-self RNA, the
viral genomes are likely shaped by the same pressures that influence the host
genome [82]. One such pressure on DNA and RNA is the APOBEC family of enzymes,
members of which are known to cause G to A mutations [85–87]. While these enzymes
primarily work on DNA, it has been demonstrated that these enzymes can also target
RNA viral genomes [86]. The APOBEC enzymes therefore have RNA editing capability
and may help contribute to the innate defence system against various RNA viruses [85].
This could therefore have a direct impact on the genomic signature of RNA viruses.
Additional mammalian mechanisms for inhibiting viral RNA have been highlighted for
retroviruses with the actions of zinc-finger antiviral protein (ZAP) [81]. ZAP targets
CG dinucleotide sequences, and in vertebrate host cells with the CG suppression in host
genomes, this can serve as a mechanism for the distinction of self vs non-self RNA and
inhibitory consequences [81]. Coronaviruses have A/U rich and C/G poor genomes,
which over time may have been, in part, a product of cytidine deamination and
selection against CG dinucleotides [88–90]. This is consistent with the fact that bats
serve as a reservoir for many coronaviruses and that bats have been observed to have
some of the largest and most diverse arrays of APOBEC genes in mammals [66, 67]. The
Spearman’s rank correlation data and the patterns observed in the CGR images from
Figure 4, of the coronavirus genomes, including COVID-19 identify patterns such as CG
underepresentation, also present in vertebrate and, importantly, bat host genomes.
With human-to-human transmission confirmed and concerns for possible
asymptomatic transmission, there is a strong need for continued intervention to prevent
the spread of the virus [33, 34, 61–63]. Due to the high amino acid similarities between
COVID-19 and SARS-CoV main protease essential for viral replication and processing,
anticoronaviral drugs targeting this protein and other potential drugs have been
identified using virtual docking to the protease for treatment of
COVID-19 [29, 44, 45, 91–94]. The human ACE2 receptor has also been identified as the
potential receptor for COVID-19 and represents a potential target for treatment [42, 43].
MLDSP-GUI is an ultra-fast, alignment-free method as is evidenced by the
time-performance of MLDSP-GUI for Test-1 to Test-6 given in Figure 7. MLDSP-GUI
took just 10.55 seconds to compute a pairwise distance matrix (including reading
sequences, computing magnitude spectra using DFT, and calculating the distance
matrix using PCC combined) for the Test-1 (largest dataset used in this study with

Conclusion

455

This study provides an alignment-free method based on intrinsic genomic signatures
that can deliver highly-accurate real-time taxonomic predictions of yet unclassified new
sequences, ab initio, using raw DNA sequence data alone and without the need for gene
or genome annotation. We use this method to provide evidence for the taxonomic
classification of COVID-19 as Sarbecovirus, within Betacoronavirus, as well as
quantitative evidence supporting a bat origin hypothesis. Our results are obtained
through a comprehensive analysis of over 5000 unique viral sequences, through an
alignment-free analysis of their two-dimensional genomic signatures, combined with a
“decision tree” use of supervised machine learning and confirmed by Spearman’s rank
correlation coefficient analyses. This study suggests that such alignment-free approaches
to comparative genomics can be used to complement alignment-based approaches when
timely taxonomic classification is of the essence, such as at critical periods during novel
viral outbreaks.
