Abstract

2

Since December 2019, a newly identified coronavirus (2019 novel coronavirus,

3

2019-nCov) is causing outbreak of pneumonia in one of largest cities, Wuhan, in

4

Hubei province of China and has draw significant public health attention. The same as

5

severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV), 2019-nCov enters into

6

host cells via cell receptor angiotensin converting enzyme II (ACE2). In order to

7

dissect the ACE2-expressing cell composition and proportion and explore a potential

8

route of the 2019-nCov infection in digestive system infection, 4 datasets with

9

single-cell transcriptomes of lung, esophagus, gastric, ileum and colon were analyzed.

10

The data showed that ACE2 was not only highly expressed in the lung AT2 cells,

11

esophagus upper and stratified epithelial cells but also in absorptive enterocytes from

12

ileum and colon. These results indicated along with respiratory systems, digestive

13

system is a potential routes for 2019-nCov infection. In conclusion, this study has

14

provided the bioinformatics evidence of the potential route for infection of 2019-nCov

15

in digestive system along with respiratory tract and may have significant impact for

16

our healthy policy setting regards to prevention of 2019-nCoV infection.

Introduction

18

At the end of 2019, a rising number of pneumonia patients with unknown pathogen

19

has been emerging in one of largest cities of China,Wuhan, and quickly spread

20

throughout whole country[1]. A novel coronavirus was then isolated from the human

21

airway epithelial cells and was named 2019 novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV)[2]. The

22

complete genome sequences has reveled that 2019-nCoV sharing 86.9% nucleotide

23

sequence identity to a severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS)-like coronavirus

24

detected in bats (bat-SL-CoVZC45, MG772933.1). This suggested that 2019-nCoV is

25

the species of SARS related coronaviruses (SARSr-CoV) by pairwise protein

26

sequence analysis[2, 3].

27

As for the clinical manifestations of 2019-nCoV infection, fever and cough are most

28

common symptoms at onset[4, 5]. In addition, it frequently induces severe enteric

1

symptoms, such as diarrhea and nausea, which are even graver than those of

2

SARS-CoV and Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV)[6, 7].

3

However, a little was known why and how the 2019-nCov induced enteric symptoms.

4

In addition, it is unknown yet whether 2019-nCoV can be transmitted through the

5

digestive tract besides respiratory tract[5].

6

The prerequisite of coronaviruses infection is its entrance into the host cell. During

7

this process, the spike (S) glycoprotein recognizes host cell receptors and induces the

8

fusion

9

metallopeptidase, angiotensin converting enzyme II (ACE2) is proved to be the cell

10

receptor, the same as SARS-CoV infection[9-11]. 2019-nCoV can enter into

11

ACE2-expressing cells, but not into cells without ACE2 or cells with other

12

coronavirus receptors, such as aminopeptidase N and dipeptidyl peptidase[10]. Thus,

13

ACE2 plays an vital role in the 2019-nCoV infection.

14

In order to explore the infection routes of 2019-nCov and the roles of ACE2 in

15

digestive system infection, we identified the ACE2-expressing cell composition and

16

proportion in normal human lung and gastrointestinal system by single-cell

17

transcriptomes based on the public databases. A striking finding is that ACE2 was not

18

only expressed in lung AT2 cells, but also found in esophagus upper and stratified

19

epithelial cells and absorptive enterocytes from ileum and colon. In addition, the

20

enteric

21

ACE2-expressing enterocytes. These findings indicate that the digestive systems

22

along with respiratory tract may be potential routes of 2019-nCov infection may have

23

significant impact for our healthy policy setting regards to prevention of 2019-nCoV

2

dataset such as cell cycle stage, or mitochondrial contamination, we used the

3

‘‘RunPCA’’ function to perform the principle component analysis (PCA) on the

single-cell expression matrix with significant HVGs. Then we constructed a

5

K-nearest-neighbor graph based on the euclidean distance in PCA space using the

Colon Dataset Single cell data expression matrix was processed with the R package

10

LIGER[18] and Seurat[17]. We first normalized the data to account for differences in

sequencing depth and capture efficiency among cells. Then we used “selectGenes”

12

function to identify variable genes on each dataset separately and took the union of

13

the result. Next integrative non-negative matrix factorization was performed to

14

identify shared and distinct metagenes across the datasets and the corresponding

factor loadings for each cell using “optimizeALS” function in LIGER. We selected a

16

k of 15 and lambda of 5.0 get a plot of expected alignment. We then identified clusters

Annotation of cell types

5

The gastrointestinal system is composed of esophagus, stomach, ileum, colon and

6

cecum. In this study, 4 datasets with single-cell transcriptomes of esophagus, gastric,

7

ileum and colon were analyzed, along with lung (Additional file). Based on Cell

8

Ranger output, the gene expression count matrices were used to present sequential

9

clustering of cells according to different organs or particular clusters. The cell type

10

identity in each cluster was annotated by the expression of the known cell type

11

markers.

12

In the esophagus, 14 cell types were identified through 87,947 cells. Over 90% cells

13

fall into four major epithelial cell types: upper, stratified, suprabasal, and dividing

14

cells of the suprabasal layer (Fig. 1A). The additional cells from the basal layer of

15

epithelia clustered more closely to the gland duct and mucous secreting cells. Lymph

16

vessel and endothelial cells are associated with vessel tissues. Immune cells in the

17

esophagus include T cells, B cells, monocytes, macrophages, dendritic cells (DCs),

18

and mast cells.

19

A total of 29,678 cells and 10 cell types were identified in the stomach after quality

20

control with a high proportion of gastric epithelial cells, including antral basal gland

21

mucous cells (GMCs), pit mucous cells (PMCs), chief cells and enteroendocrine cells

22

(Fig. 1B). The non-epithelial cell lineages were composed of T cells, B cells, myeloid

23

cells, fibroblasts and endothelial cells.

24

After quality controls, 50,286 cells and 10 cell types were identified in the ileum (Fig.

25

1C). The detected cell types included epithelia, endothelial, fibroblast and

26

enteroendocrine cells. The identified immune cell types were myeloid, CD4+T,

27

CD8+T and natural killer T (NKT) cells, along with plasma and B cells. Among

1

11,218 epithelial cells, 5 cell types were identified, namely, absorptive enterocytes,

2

progenitor absorptive, goblet, Paneth and undifferentiated cells (Fig. 1D).

3

All the 47,442 cells from the colon were annotated after quality controls (Fig. 1E).

4

Absorptive and secretory clusters were identified in epithelial cells. The absorptive

5

clusters included further sub-clusters for transit amplifying (TA) cells (TA 1, TA 2),

6

immature enterocytes, and enterocytes. The secretory clusters included sub-clusters

7

for progenitor cells (secretory TA, immature goblet) and for mature cells (goblet, and

8

enteroendocrine). Ganglion cells and cycling TA cells were also identified in the final

9

UMAP.

10

Cell type-specific ACE2 expression

11

With regard to stomach, the expression of ACE2 is relatively low in all the clusters

12

(Fig. 2B, C). The selected cell type-specific marker genes were used to identify each

13

cluster in the stomach (Fig. 2C). MUC6 and TIFF1 were highly expressed in all the

14

clusters. PGA4 was used to identify chief cells, along with CHGB for enteroendocrine

15

cells, CD34 for endothelial cells, CD79A for B cells, CD8A and PRF1 for T cells,

16

VCAN and COL1A1 for fibrosus blast and CLEC10A for myeloid cells.

17

As for esophagus, ACE2 was highly expressed in upper and stratified epithelial cells

18

(Fig. 3B, C). The glands also have a low expression of ACE2 (Fig. 3C). The selected

19

cell type-specific marker genes were used to identify each cluster in the esophagus

20

(Fig. 3C). ECM1 was highly expressed in upper epithelial cells. KRT4 and 5 were

21

mainly found in stratified epithelial cells. KI67 was used to identify dividing

22

epithelial cells, with MUC5B and KRT23 for glands, COL1A1 and DCN for stroma

23

cells, VWF and PECAM1 for lymph vessel and endothelial cells. TPSB2, FCN1,

24

CD79A, GNLY, CD27 and CD3E were used for immune cells, such as myeloid, DC,

25

B, T and mast cells.

26

In the epithelial cells of the ileum, ACE2 was highly expressed in absorptive

27

enterocytes and less expressed in progenitor absorptive cells, which was similar to

28

those in the colon (Fig. 4B, C). The selected cell type-specific marker genes were also

used to identify the epithelial cells of the ileum (Fig. 4C). SEC2A5 was found mainly

2

in the absorptive enterocytes and progenitor absorptive cells. CD24 was found in all

3

epithelial cells except absorptive enterocytes. MII67 and AMACR were highly

4

expressed in undifferentiated and Paneth cells, respectively. BCAS1 was used to

5

identify undifferentiated cells, with AMACR for Paneth.

6

In the colon, ACE2 was mainly found in enterocytes and less expressed in immature

7

enterocytes (Fig. 5B, C). The selected cell type-specific marker genes were used to

8

identify each cluster in the colon (Fig. 5C). AQPB was mainly found in enterocytes

9

and immature enterocytes. Additionally, ZG16 and ITLN1 was highly expressed in

10

goblet and immature goblet. The expression of APOE was in TA2 and secretory TA.

11

CD27 and TPH1 were used to identify enteroendocrine, with SPC25 for cycling TA.

12

After initial quality controls, 57,020 cells and 25 cell types were identified in the lung

13

(Fig. 6A). The detected cell types included ciliated, alveolar type 1 (AT1) and

14

alveolar type 2 (AT2) cells, along with fibroblast, muscle, and endothelial cells. The

15

identified immune cell types were T, B and NK cells, along with macrophages,

16

monocytes and dendritic cells (DC). ACE2 was mainly expressed in AT2 cells and

17

could also be found in AT1 and fibroblast cells (Fig. 6B).

18

Among all the ACE2-expressing cells in normal digestive system and lung, the

19

expression of ACE2 was more in ileum and colon than that in the lung and esophagus

20

(Fig. 6C).

Discussion

22

The coronaviruses is the common infection source of upper respiratory,

23

gastrointestinal and central nervous system in humans and other mammals[19]. At the

24

beginning of the twenty-first century, two betacoronaviruses, SARS-CoV and

25

MERS-CoV, caused persistent public panics and became the most significant public

26

health events[20]. In December 2019, a novel identified coronavirus (2019-nCov)

27

induced an ongoing outbreak of pneumonia in Wuhan, Hubei, China with arising

28

number of infected patients[4]. Till now, its infection routes and digestive system

infection are still unclear. In this study, we found the high expressions of ACE2, the

2

cell entry receptor of 2019-nCov, in the lung AT2 cells, esophagus upper and stratified

3

epithelial cells and absorptive enterocytes from ileum and colon, indicating that not

4

only respiratory system but also digestive system are potential routes of infection. In

5

addition, the enteric symptoms of 2019-nCov may be associated with the invaded

6

ACE2-expressing enterocytes.

7

Generally, many respiratory pathogens, such as influenza, SARS-CoV and

8

SARSr-CoV, cause enteric symptoms, so is 2019-nCov[4, 5]. As a classic respiratory

9

coronavirus, SARS often causes enteric symptoms along with respiratory symptoms.

10

Moreover, transmission with stool is also a neglected risk for SARS[21]. During the

11

infection of SARS and highly pathogenic strains of influenza, their enteric symptoms

12

are associated with the increased permeability to intestinal lipopolysaccharide (LPS)

13

and bacterial transmigration through gastrointestinal wall[22, 23]. However, the

14

mechanism of 2019-nCov-induced enteric symptom is still unknown.

15

A recent study revealed that similar to SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, ACE2 was the

16

cell entry receptor for 2019-nCov[10]. Previously, ACE2 was isolated from

17

SARS-CoV-permissive Vero E6 cells[24]. It could interact with a defined

18

receptor-binding domain (RBD) of CTD1 in SARS-CoV and facilitate efficient

19

cross-species infection and person-to-person transmission[9, 25]. The “up” and “down”

20

transition of CTD1 allows ACE2 binding by regulating the relationship among CTD1,

21

CTD2, S1-ACE2 complex and S2 subunit[26]. With regard to human HeLa cells,

22

expressing ACE2 from human, civet, and Chinese horseshoe bat can help many kinds

23

of SARSr-CoV, including 2019-nCov, to enter into the cells, indicating the important

24

role of ACE2 in cellular entry [10, 27-29]. Therapeutically, anti-ACE2 antibody can

25

block viral replication on Vero E6 cells[24].

26

By analyzing the expression of ACE2 in normal human gastrointestinal system and

27

lung, we found high expression of ACE2 in the lung AT2 cells, esophagus upper and

28

stratified epithelial cells and absorptive enterocytes from ileum and colon. Similar to

1

the previous study, ACE2 was more expressed in AT2 cells and less expressed in AT1

2

cells in normal lung[30]. In lung alveoli, AT1 epithelial cells are responsible for gas

3

exchange and AT2 cells are in charge of surfactant biosynthesis and

4

self-renewing[31]. In SARS-CoV infection, AT2 is the major infected cell types by

5

viral antigens and secretory vesicles detection. Its expression in AT2 cells is variable

6

in different donors, which may be associated with different susceptibility and

7

seriousness[30].

2019-nCov-invaded cell in lung and its number might be associated with the severity

9

of respiratory symptoms, which can explain the existence of asymptomatic

Thus,

we

suppose

that

AT2

cells

might

the

key

10

2019-nCov carrier.

11

ACE2 was also highly expressed in the esophagus upper and stratified epithelial cells.

12

Histologically, both esophagus and respiratory system organs, such as trachea and

13

lung are originated from the anterior portion of the intermediate foregut[32]. After

14

being separated from the neighboring respiratory system, the esophagus undergoes

15

subsequent morphogenesis of a simple columnar-to-stratified squamous epithelium

16

conversion[33]. The stratified squamous epithelium can be nourished by submucosal

17

glands and sustain the passing of the abrasive raw food. In Barrett’s oesophagus (BE),

18

acid reflux-induced oesophagitis and the multilayered epithelium (MLE) are

19

associated with both upper and stratified epithelial cells[34].

20

In the digestive system, besides esophagus upper and stratified epithelial cells, ACE2

21

was also found in the absorptive enterocytes from ileum and colon, the most

22

vulnerable intestinal epithelial cells. In microbe infections, the intestinal epithelial

23

cells function as a barrier and help to coordinate immune responses[35]. The

24

absorptive enterocytes can be infected by coronavirus, rotavirus and noroviruses,

25

resulting in diarrhea by destructing absorptive enterocytes, malabsorption, unbalanced

26

intestinal secretion and activated enteric nervous system[36-38]. Thus, we suppose

27

that the enteric symptom of diarrhea might be associated with the invaded

28

ACE2-expressing enterocytes. In addition, due to the high expression of cell receptor

Conclusion

This study provides the bioinformatics evidence for the potential respiratory and

treating the 2019-nCoV infection.
