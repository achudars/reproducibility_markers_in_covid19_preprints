Abstract

18

a protease that cleaves the viral replicase polyprotein, and a deubiquitinating (DUB) enzyme which

19

removes ubiquitin moieties from ubiquitin-conjugated proteins. Previous in vitro studies

20

implicated PLP2 DUB activity as a negative regulator of the host interferon (IFN) response, but

21

the role of DUB activity during virus infection was unknown. Here, we used X-ray structure-

22

guided mutagenesis and functional studies to identify amino acid substitutions within the

23

ubiquitin-binding surface of PLP2 that reduced DUB activity without affecting polyprotein

24

processing activity. We engineered a DUB mutation (Asp1772 to Ala) into a murine coronavirus

25

and evaluated the replication and pathogenesis of the DUB mutant virus (DUBmut) in cultured

26

macrophages and in mice. We found that the DUBmut virus replicates similarly as the wild-type

27

virus in cultured cells, but the DUBmut virus activates an IFN response at earlier times compared

28

to the wild-type virus infection in macrophages, consistent with DUB activity negatively

29

regulating the IFN response. We compared the pathogenesis of the DUBmut virus to the wild-type

30

virus and found that the DUBmut-infected mice had a statistically significant reduction (p<0.05)

31

in viral titer in livers and spleens at day 5 post-infection, albeit both wild-type and DUBmut virus

32

infections resulted in similar liver pathology. Overall, this study demonstrates that structure-guided

33

mutagenesis aids the identification of critical determinants of PLP2-ubiquitin complex, and that

34

PLP2 DUB activity plays a role as an interferon antagonist in coronavirus pathogenesis.

35

Importance

Coronaviruses express a multifunctional papain-like protease, termed PLP2. PLP2 acts as

36

Coronaviruses employ a genetic economy by encoding multifunctional proteins that

37

function in viral replication and also modify the host environment to disarm the innate immune

38

response. The coronavirus papain-like protease 2 (PLP2) domain possesses protease activity,

39

which cleaves the viral replicase polyprotein, and also DUB activity (de-conjugating

40

ubiquitin/ubiquitin-like molecules from modified substrates) using identical catalytic residues. To

41

separate the DUB activity from the protease activity, we employed a structure-guided mutagenesis

42

approach and identified residues that are important for ubiquitin-binding. We found that mutating

43

the ubiquitin-binding residues results in a PLP2 that has reduced DUB activity but retains protease

44

activity. We engineered a recombinant murine coronavirus to express the DUB mutant and showed

45

that the DUB mutant virus activated an earlier type I interferon response in macrophages and

46

exhibited reduced pathogenesis in mice. The results of this study demonstrate that PLP2/DUB is

47

an interferon antagonist and a virulence trait of coronaviruses.

48

Introduction

49

Coronaviruses (CoVs) are members of the order Nidovirales, which includes enveloped viruses

50

with large (~30kb), positive-sense single-stranded RNA genomes that yield a characteristic nested

51

set of subgenomic mRNAs during replication in the cytoplasm of infected cells (1, 2). The genome

52

organization for coronaviruses is highly conserved, with the 5’-most two-thirds of the genome

53

encoding the replicase polyprotein, followed by sequences encoding the canonical structural

54

proteins: spike, envelope, membrane, and nucleocapsid. Many CoVs contain accessory genes,

55

which are interspersed among the genes for the structural proteins. Although these accessory genes

56

are not necessarily required for virus replication and are, in general, not highly conserved within

57

the virus family, many encode proteins that regulate the host response (3). Interestingly,

58

coronavirus replicase proteins, which are highly conserved, can also act as antagonists to block or

59

delay the host innate immune response to infection (1, 4–8). That a slew of coronavirus-encoded

60

accessory and non-accessory proteins have been shown to shape the host antiviral response

61

suggests that viral-mediated subversion of host defenses is an important element of infection. Here,

62

we focus on the viral protease/deubiquitinase (DUB) with the goal of assessing the role of DUB

63

activity in shaping the pathogenesis of mouse hepatitis virus (MHV), a model murine coronavirus.

64

Coronavirus proteases are essential for viral replication as they are responsible for processing

65

the replicase polyprotein (2, 9–11). Murine coronavirus MHV encodes three proteases: two

66

papain-like proteases (PLP1 and PLP2) and one chymotrypsin-like protease (3CLpro, also termed

67

Mpro). MHV PLP2 is similar to the single papain-like protease (termed PLpro) of Severe Acute

68

Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus (SARS-CoV) and Middle East Respiratory Syndrome

69

Coronavirus (MERS-CoV) (9, 12–16). We and others have revealed that PLP2 or PLpro of

70

multiple coronaviruses, including MHV, are multifunctional, not only capable of cleaving the viral

71

polyprotein but also possessing deubiquitinase (DUB) and deISGylating (de-conjugating ISG15

72

molecule from modified substrates) activities (9, 12, 13, 15–27). However, it has been challenging

73

to study the effects of a mutated DUB on virus replication and pathogenesis because the protease

74

and DUB activities share the same catalytic site, disruption of which is lethal for virus replication.

75

Therefore, it was necessary for us to identify residue(s) within the MHV protease/DUB-ubiquitin

76

binding surface that can be mutated to result in reduced DUB activity without affecting polyprotein

77

processing. In this report, we describe the X-ray structure-guided identification of such residues

78

and evaluate the replication, IFN antagonistic effect, and pathogenesis of a recombinant DUB

79

mutant MHV.

80

Results

81

Structure-guided identification of PLP2 residues interacting with ubiquitin. To investigate

82

the role of viral deubiquitinating activity in coronavirus replication and pathogenesis, we first

83

needed to identify amino acid residues that, when mutated, result in reduced DUB activity while

84

preserving the enzyme’s deISGylating and protease activities, the latter being necessary for viral

85

replication. X-ray structural studies of SARS- and MERS-CoV papain-like protease/DUBs co-

86

crystalized with ubiquitin modified at the c-terminus with a covalent warhead (aldehyde, 3-bromo-

87

propylamine, or propargylamine) allowed for identification of residues that are important for direct

88

interaction with ubiquitin (17, 18, 20). Here, we took a slightly different approach and mutated the

89

catalytic cysteine (C1716) of MHV PLP2 to a serine residue and co-crystallized it with free

90

ubiquitin. The X-ray structure of MHV PLP2 (C1716S) in complex with ubiquitin was determined

91

to a resolution of 1.85 Å and an overall Rfree = 19.6% and Rwork = 15.8% (PDB: 5WFI). The overall

92

structure of the MHV PLP2-ubiquitin complex is similar to other PLP2/PLpro ubiquitin-bound

93

structures (Fig. 1A). Ubiquitin binds within the palm region and is gripped by the zinc-fingers

94

motif while the C-terminus extends into the active site.

95

Next, we aligned the primary amino acid sequence of the MHV PLP2 domain with the

96

SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV papain-like protease domains (Fig. 1E). The sequence alignment and

97

X-ray structure of the MHV PLP2–ubiquitin complex were then analyzed in conjunction with the

98

previous structural and mutagenesis studies on SARS- and MERS-CoV to identify candidate

99

residues that could be mutated to render a loss of DUB activity in vitro. From this analysis, we

100

identified three residues (R1803, D1772, F1812) in MHV PLP2 that form direct interactions with

101

ubiquitin (Fig. 1B-D). Two of the side chain guanidinium nitrogens of R1803 form direct hydrogen

102

bonds with the backbone carbonyl oxygen of A46 in ubiquitin (Fig. 1B). The two side chain

103

carboxylate oxygens of D1772 in MHV PLP2 interact with ubiquitin by forming direct bonds with

104

each of the guanidinium nitrogens of R42 and with one of the guanidinium nitrogens of R72 (Fig.

105

1C). Finally, F1812 forms Van der Waals contacts with the side chains of I44 and V70 and the

106

delta-carbon of R42 of ubiquitin (Fig. 1D).

107

Biochemical analysis of PLP2 mutants’ activities. To identify a mutant MHV PLP2 enzyme that

108

retains protease activity but exhibits reduced DUB and/or deISGylating activity, we performed

109

site-directed mutagenesis on each of the residues (R1803, D1772, F1812) by changing each to an

110

alanine to disrupt interactions with ubiquitin. Each mutant enzyme was expressed, purified, and

111

tested for its ability to hydrolyze three substrates: z-RLRGG-AMC, Ub-AMC, and ISG15-AMC.

112

The activity of each mutant enzyme toward each substrate relative to the wild-type enzyme is

113

shown in Fig. 2A. All three mutants retained their ability to hydrolyze the peptide substrate but

114

each mutant had altered specificity toward Ub-AMC and ISG15-AMC substrates. Mutation of

115

F1812 resulted in a substantial decrease in hydrolysis of both Ub-AMC and ISG15-AMC (Class

116

I), whereas mutation of R1803 resulted in loss of activity only toward ISG15-AMC (Class II), and

117

mutation of D1772 resulted in loss of activity only toward Ub-AMC (Class III).

118

Since one of the primary goals of this study is to understand the contribution of DUB

119

activity to viral replication and pathogenesis, we next focused on quantitating further the effects

120

of the D1772A mutant on the steady-state kinetic parameters of MHV PLP2 toward the three

121

different substrates (Fig. 2B). The RLRGG-AMC peptide substrate is often used as surrogate of

122

the viral polyprotein substrate and the kinetic data in Fig. 2B show that this substrate is still well-

123

recognized and cleaved by the D1772A mutant. In fact, we observed a small rate enhancement in

124

the catalytic efficiency (i.e., kcat/Km) compared to the wild-type enzyme.

125

The Ub-AMC substrate, on the other hand, is poorly recognized and cleaved by the

126

D1772A mutant compared to the wild-type enzyme. The wild-type enzyme normally interacts

127

strongly with Ub-AMC with a Km value of 0.67 µM. However, mutation of D1772 to an alanine

128

significantly disrupts the interaction with ubiquitin, making it impossible to saturate MHV PLP2

129

under normal experimental conditions (Fig. 2B). The net result is a significant reduction in the

130

catalytic efficiency (kcat/Km) compared to the wild-type enzyme, which was the goal of these trials.

131

The kinetic response of MHV PLP2 toward another substrate, ISG15-AMC, was also

132

determined. ISG15 is an important ubiquitin-like modifier that is upregulated and used to ISGylate

133

host proteins during viral infection. A number of viruses, including coronaviruses, engender

134

ISGylation during infection but the function(s) and importance of this activity are not clear (28–

135

30). For MHV, neither the wild-type nor the D1772A mutant PLP2 enzyme can be saturated with

136

ISG15-AMC, suggesting weak binding with this ubiquitin-like modifier (Fig. 2B). Moreover, the

137

R1772A mutation does not disrupt the interaction with ISG15 but in fact enhances it to some

138

degree. A potential explanation for the observed selective disruption of ubiquitin binding stems

139

from our analysis of a primary sequence alignment of ubiquitin and ISG15 and the residues that

140

interact with D1772 (Fig. 2C). The interaction between MHV PLP2 D1772 and the R42 residue in

141

human and mouse ubiquitin is absent in human and mouse ISG15 since this residue is a tryptophan

142

in human and mouse ISG15. Therefore, in line with our observations, D1772A mutation would

143

not be expected to alter ISG15 binding. In contrast to R42, residue R72 is conserved in both

144

ubiquitin and ISG15 and its interaction with MHV PLP2 for ubiquitin is likely weaker than that

145

with ISG15.

146

PLP2 D1772A mutant exhibits reduced DUB activity and inhibition of IFN response in cell

147

culture based assays. The in vitro biochemical studies presented here support the notion that we

148

are able to use a structure-guided mutagenesis to uncouple the DUB enzymatic activity from MHV

149

PLP2 while preserving the peptide hydrolysis and deISGylating activities of PLP2. Next, we

150

focused on comparing the activity of the mutant enzyme to its wild-type counterpart for the ability

151

to remove Flag-tagged-ubiquitin conjugated to host proteins in cultured cells (Fig. 3A). We found

152

that in cells, wild-type PLP2 exhibits robust DUB activity and removes ubiquitin modifications

153

from multiple cellular proteins. On the other hand, the PLP2-D1772A mutant exhibits reduced

154

DUB activity, similar to that of the previously documented catalytic cysteine to alanine mutant,

155

PLP2-CA (19). To determine if this impaired DUB activity altered the ability of PLP2 to act as an

156

interferon antagonist, we transfected cells with a RIG-I expression plasmid, an interferon-

157

luciferase reporter construct, and either wild-type or mutant PLP2 plasmid and measured luciferase

158

activity at 18 hours post-transfection. In agreement with previous reports (13, 25, 31), we find that

159

wild-type PLP2 acts as an interferon antagonist, reducing reporter activity by 50-80%. In contrast,

160

PLP2-D1772A is unable to significantly reduce interferon activation in this assay despite similar

161

expression levels of the wild-type and mutant versions of the protein (Fig. 3B). We also evaluated

162

the protease activity of the enzymes in cells using two independent trans-cleavage assays and

163

found that the wild-type and DUB-mutant enzymes produce similar levels of cleaved products.

164

These results indicate that the D1772A substitution did not alter protease activity (Fig. 3C and D),

165

in agreement with the in vitro kinetic results described above (Fig. 2). Together, these studies

166

reveal that aspartic acid residue 1772 of MHV-PLP2 is important for DUB activity and interferon

167

antagonism, but not for protease activity.

168

Recombinant MHV harboring PLP2-D1772A activates an earlier IFN response in bone

169

marrow-derived macrophages. Since the D1772A substitution did not impact protease activity,

170

we reasoned that we should be able to generate recombinant virus containing this substitution,

171

thereby allowing us to determine if the mutation has any effect on viral replication kinetics and

172

interferon antagonism in the context of the live virus. We engineered the mutant virus via reverse

173

genetics (32), performed full genome sequencing to verify the genotype (2 nucleotide changes at

174

positions 5525 and 5526, resulting in D1772A substitution in the replicase polyprotein), and

175

designated the virus as DUBmut. Upon evaluating virus replication of the DUBmut virus by

176

performing a growth kinetics experiment in parallel with wild-type virus, we found that the

177

DUBmut virus replicates with essentially identical kinetics as the wild-type in a murine

178

astrocytoma cell line (DBT cells) (Fig. 4A). These results are consistent with previous studies of

179

coronavirus interferon antagonists, which showed in many cell lines that viral-mediated interferon

180

antagonism is not essential for virus replication (5, 6). Regarding the other ubiquitin-interacting

181

residues identified in the structural analysis, we attempted to rescue virus with substitutions at the

182

F1812 position, but were unable to recover viable virus. These results indicate that F1812 may

183

play a critical role within the polyprotein during virus replication. We were able to recover virus

184

containing the R1803A substitution, but found that it had no detectable phenotype, which we

185

documented in our previous study (5). Here, we focus our efforts on evaluating replication and

186

pathogenesis of the recovered DUBmut virus.

187

To determine if the impaired DUB activity of the DUBmut virus had an effect on interferon

188

antagonism, we infected primary bone marrow-derived macrophages (BMDMs) and evaluated

189

viral replication kinetics and levels of interferon mRNA and protein. We observed significant

190

activation of interferon alpha (IFN) mRNA expression (Fig. 4A) that is coupled with release of

191

IFNprotein into the supernatant, as detected by ELISA (Fig. 4B). We show that this activation

192

of IFN is dependent on expression of pattern recognition receptor MDA5 (Fig. 4D), in agreement

193

with previous reports (5, 6, 33). To our surprise, we found that replication of DUBmut is not

194

impaired relative to the wild-type virus in BMDMs, as measured by level of nucleocapsid RNA

195

(Fig. 4E) and evaluation of infectious virus particle production over time in the kinetics assay (Fig.

196

4F). These results demonstrate that an elevated interferon response is generated during replication

197

of the DUBmut virus, but that this interferon profile is not associated with reduced production of

198

infectious particles in either DBT cells or BMDMs.

199

Disrupting DUB activity mildly attenuates coronavirus pathogenesis in mice. To

200

complement our in vitro studies, we next sought to determine whether loss of DUB activity and

201

the observed activation of interferon during the DUBmut virus infection in macrophages is

202

associated with an attenuated pathogenesis in mice. To test this, we first inoculated mice using the

203

intracranial infection model to evaluate lethality among WT and DUBmut-infected mice, and

204

found similar weight loss and lethality (data not shown). To investigate the pathogenesis in the

205

liver, we inoculated four- (young) or six-week-old (adult) mice intra-peritoneally with a low dose

206

(6×103 plaque-forming units [pfu]) or a high dose (6×104 pfu) of the designated virus, respectively,

207

and measured viral titer in the liver and spleen at the indicated days post-infection (dpi). We

208

observed similar levels of infectious particles in young mice inoculated with a high dose of virus

209

and adult mice with a low dose at 3 and 5 dpi (data not shown), but detected reduced viral titers in

210

the spleens of young mice infected with a low dose of DUBmut virus at 3 dpi (Fig. 5A) and adult

211

mice inoculated with a high dose at 5 dpi (Fig. 5B). Similar pathology in liver sections was

212

observed at 3 and 5 dpi (Fig. 5C). These results indicate that the DUBmut virus is mildly attenuated

213

compared to the wild-type virus, suggesting that the DUB activity does play a role in MHV

214

pathogenesis and PLP2 is a virulence factor.

215

Discussion

216

In the present study, we aimed to investigate the roles of PLP2 DUB activity during

217

coronavirus infection. Through structure-guided mutagenesis, we identified residues of MHV

218

PLP2 that mediates its interaction with ubiquitin. By mutating the residue Asp-1772 to Ala

219

(D1772A), we found that the DUB activity of PLP2 was greatly reduced and a recombinant MHV

220

carrying this mutation (DUBmut) activated an earlier IFN response in macrophages. Although we

221

only observed a subtle attenuation of the DUBmut virus in the tested animal models, we

222

demonstrated that PLP2 DUB activity does play a role in suppressing the host immune response

223

and is a virulence trait, strengthening our earlier discoveries on SARS-CoV PLpro (4). We further

224

investigated the differences in the interferon response generated in response to WT versus

225

DUBmut virus in our companion study (Volk et al., submitted), which further supports a role for

226

DUB activity in modulating the interferon response in macrophages.

227

The structure-guided approach used to generate the DUBmut virus allowed for

228

characterization of three different classes of mutant enzymes: Class I, deficient in both DUB and

229

deISGylating activity; Class II, deficient in deISGylating activity only; and Class III, deficient in

230

DUB activity but competent in protease and deISGylating activity. We utilized three unique

231

biochemical substrates, each with a conjugated fluorescent AMC reporter, to evoke the multi-

232

functional activities of PLP2. Activity against the z-RLRGG-AMC peptide substrate represents

233

the polyprotein processing activity of MHV PLP2, while UB-AMC and ISG15-AMC stimulate

234

the deubiquitinating and deISGylating activities of the enzyme, respectively (17, 34). The kinetic

235

data for the D1772A DUBmut hydrolysis of the z-RLRGG-peptide provided in Figure 2B indicate

236

that the polyprotein processing ability of this mutant is likely not affected by the D1772A

237

substitution. The deISGylating ability of the enzyme is also not affected. In contrast, the mutant

238

enzyme’s deubiquitinating activity is significantly reduced relative to wild-type, which is most

239

likely due to a lowered binding affinity for ubiquitin as the enzyme could not be saturated with

240

Ub-AMC as a substrate.

241

We can also use these structural, mutagenesis and kinetic characterization studies on MHV

242

PLP2 to guide future structure-based design studies of emerging coronaviruses, such as the newly

243

emerged novel coronavirus 2019 (nCoV-2019) (35–38). By aligning the X-ray structure of the

244

PLpro domains of SARS-CoV bound to ubiquitin (17) with the sequence of nCoV-2019 PLpro

245

(Fig. 6A) and comparing the differences in their residues with those of MHV PLP2 (Fig. 1E), we

246

observe significant differences in the potential interactions between nCoV-2019 and ubiquitin. For

247

example, we found that the hydrogen bonds between MHV PLP2 R1803 and the carbonyl oxygen

248

of UbA46 (Fig. 1B) are lost in nCoV-2019 and SARS-CoV (Fig. 6B). In contrast, the hydrogen

249

bonds between MHV PLP2 D1772 and Ub residues R42 and R72 (Fig. 1C) are likely preserved

250

with the substitution of E1772 in nCoV-2019 and SARS-CoV PLpro (Fig. 6C). The hydrophobic

251

interactions between Ub residues I44 and V70 and F1812 of MHV PLP2 (Fig. 1D) also appear to

252

be preserved with M1812 of nCoV-2019 and SARS-CoV PLpro (Fig. 6D). The X-ray structures

253

of MHV PLP2 and SARS-CoV PLpro, together with our structural model of nCoV-2019 PLpro,

254

will provide testable hypotheses for the design and mutagenesis of the ubiquitin-binding domain

255

(17) and diubiquitin-binding domains (20) of the recently emerged coronavirus nCoV-2019 PLpro.

256

We were able to reproduce the enzymatic profile of the purified PLP2-D1772A mutant

257

protein when we expressed it in cell culture (Fig. 3). Therefore, our finding that the DUBmut virus

258

containing the PLP2-D1772A substitution activates an elevated antiviral response in macrophages

259

compared to the wild-type virus, but that this antiviral state results in only mild attenuation of

260

disease in mice relative to WT infection, was unexpected. Previous studies demonstrated that

261

ubiquitin has important roles in both the activation and the attenuation of innate antiviral pathways

262

(39); therefore, we anticipated a more remarkable phenotype for a DUB-mutant virus. We can

263

imagine several possible explanations for our findings. First, it is possible that viral DUB activity

264

has a relatively minor role in shaping pathogenesis in this system. In fact, our recent studies using

265

SARS-CoV and SARS-related CoVs found that the papain-like protease domain/DUB is a

266

virulence trait that varies among members of the SARS-coronavirus species (4). In that study, we

267

found that replacing the SARS PLP2/DUB domain with a SARS-related PLP2/DUB domain

268

reduced the ability of that virus to antagonize the innate immune response. Together, this previous

269

report in conjunction with the current study support the concept that different PLP2/DUB domains

270

may have distinct effects on antagonism of the innate immune response depending on the virus

271

and the host cell type. Another possibility is that the DUB-mutant virus we generated may not have

272

been sufficiently debilitated in its DUB activity to result in altered pathogenesis. We found that it

273

was difficult to recover viable DUB-mutant viruses; indeed, this D1772A mutant was the sole

274

viable DUB-mutant representative of our many attempts. Because an elevated interferon response

275

was elicited from the DUBmut-infected cells, this mutant virus fulfilled our criteria demonstrating

276

the inactivation of an interferon antagonist. However, we speculate that if we are able to recover

277

mutants that exhibit a range of DUB activity, we may be able to more fully assess the role of DUB

278

activity as a contributor to coronaviral pathogenesis. Despite these caveats, the MHV DUB-mutant

279

generated in this study did exhibit a reproducible phenotype of eliciting an elevated interferon

280

response in infected macrophages that was associated with mild attenuation of pathogenesis with

281

reduced titers in the livers and spleens of infected mice. Overall, we conclude that DUB activity

282

is indeed a virulence trait, and contributes to the ability of MHV to modulate the host innate

283

immune response to infection. Further studies are needed to identify the targets of viral DUB

284

activity and the detailed role of DUB activity in delaying the innate immune response to virus

285

replication.

Ethics Statement

288

The mouse experiment in this study was carried out in accordance with the

289

recommendations in the Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals of the National

290

Institutes of Health. The experimental protocol was reviewed and approved by the Institutional

291

Animal Care and Use Committee (IACUC) at Loyola University Chicago (IACUC#: 2016-029).

292

C57BL/6 female mice were purchased from The Jackson Laboratory and maintained in the

293

Comparative Medicine Facility of Loyola University Chicago. Mice were consistently monitored

294

for signs of distress over the course of the experiments to be removed from the experiment and

295

euthanized using carbon dioxide inhalation to prevent unnecessary suffering.

296

Cells

297

Human embryonic kidney (HEK) 293T cells were purchased the from American Type

298

Culture Collection (ATCC, # CRL-11268) and maintained in DMEM (#10-017-CV, Corning)

299

containing 10% fetal calf serum (FCS) and supplemented with 1% nonessential amino acids, 1%

300

HEPES, 2% L-glutamine, 1% sodium pyruvate, and 1% penicillin/streptomycin. DBT cells were

301

cultured in MEM (#61100-061, ThermoFisher) supplemented with 5% FCS, 2% L-glutamine, and

302

10% Tryptose Phosphate Broth (TPB). The 17Cl-1 cell line was maintained in DMEM containing

303

5% FCS. Baby hamster kidney cells expressing the MHV receptor (BHK-R) were kindly provided

304

by Mark Denison (Vanderbilt University Medical Center) and maintained in DMEM supplemented

305

with 10% FCS, 2% L-glutamine, and 0.8 µg/mL G418. Bone marrow-derived macrophages

306

(BMDMs) were prepared and cultured as described previously (5).

307

Plasmids and mutagenesis

308

The sequence of the PLP2 domain (amino acids 1525-1911 of MHV pp1ab) in frame with

309

a V5 epitope tag was codon-optimized, synthesized by Genscript (Piscataway, NJ) (sequence

310

available upon request), and cloned into pCAGGS vector. For mutagenesis, an overlapping PCR

311

strategy was used with synthetic primers (sequences available upon request). The introduced

312

mutations were verified by sequencing. The RIG-I and nsp2/3-GFP expression plasmid was kindly

313

provided Ralph Baric (University of North Carolina). The IFNβ-Luc reporter plasmid was a gift

314

of John Hiscott (Jewish General Hospital, Montreal, Canada). The Flag-Ub plasmid was kindly

315

provided by Adriano Marchese (University of Wisconsin-Milwaukee).

316

MHV PLP2 wild-type and mutant purification, kinetics, and X-ray structure

317

The wild-type, C1716S, D1772A, R1803A, and F1812A mutant enzymes were expressed

318

and purified similar to our previously published methods except that the MHV PLP2 construct

319

used here (amino acids N1609 to N1909) was absent the DPUP domain (16). Crystallization and

320

X-ray structure determination details will be published elsewhere. Steady-state kinetic studies on

321

the wild-type, D1772A, R1803A, and F1812A mutant enzymes with substrates Z-RLRGG-AMC

322

(where Z is a carboxybenzyl protecting group), Ubiquitin-AMC, and ISG15-AMC were performed

323

as described previously (16). Structure figures were generated with the software program UCSF

324

Chimera (40).

325

Protease and deubiquitinating activity assays

326

To determine the protease activity of PLP2, HEK293T cells grown to 70% confluency in

327

24-well plates (Corning) were transfected using TransIT-LT1 (MIR2300, Mirus) according to the

328

manufacturer’s protocol. For the protease activity assay, HEK293T cells were transfected with 25

329

ng nsp2/3-GFP plasmid and 200 ng pCAGGS-PLP2-V5 expression plasmids (wild-type and

330

mutant). To determine deubiquitinating activity of the proteins, cells were transfected with 200 ng

331

Flag-Ub plasmid and pCAGGS-PLP2-V5 expression plasmids (wild-type and mutant). Cells were

332

lysed 24 h post-transfection with 100 µL of lysis buffer (comprising 20 mM Tris [pH 7.5], 150

336

to PVDF membrane in transfer buffer (0.025M Tris, 0.192M glycine, 20% methanol) for 1 hour

337

at 60 Volts at 4°C. Following this, the membrane was blocked using 5% dried skim milk in TBST

338

buffer (0.9% NaCl, 10mM Tris-HCl, pH7.5, 0.1% Tween 20) overnight at 4°C. The membrane

339

was incubated with either polyclonal rabbit anti-GFP antibody (A11122, Life Technologies) for

340

the protease assay, or mouse anti-flag (F3165, Sigma) for the DUB assay. The membrane was then

341

washed three times for 15 minutes in TBST buffer followed by incubation with either secondary

342

donkey anti-rabbit-HRP antibody (711-035-152, Jackson ImmunoResearch) or goat anti-mouse-

343

HRP antibody (1010-05, SouthernBiotech). Then the membrane was washed three more times for

344

15 minutes in TBST buffer. Detection was performed using Western Lighting Chemiluminescence

345

Reagent Plus (PerkinElmer) and visualized using a FluoroChemE Imager (Protein Simple). The

346

expression of PLP2, β-actin, and calnexin were probed with mouse anti-V5 antibody (R960,

347

ThermoFisher), mouse anti–β-actin (A00702, Genscript), or mouse anti-calnexin antibody (2433S,

348

Cell Signaling), respectively.

355

Generating DUB-mutant MHV

356

We used a previously described reverse genetics system of MHV-A59 (32) to generate the

357

DUB-mutant virus. Briefly, the nucleotides coding for the Asp-1772 of the PLP2 domain were

358

mutated via site-directed mutagenesis. Viral genomic RNA from in vitro transcription of ligated

359

cDNA fragments using a mMESSAGE mMACHINE T7 Transcription Kit (AM1344, Thermal

360

Fisher) was electroporated into BHK-R cells. Cell supernatants were collected as viral stock

361

following observation of cytopathic effects. Rescued virus was plaque-purified, propagated on

362

BHK-R cells, and titrated on 17Cl-1 cells. The stock virus was subjected to full-genome

363

sequencing and the sequences were aligned to the parental strain, with the intended engineered

364

mutation detected and no additional mutations detected (Kansas State University Diagnostic

365

Laboratory).

366

Growth kinetics

367

DBT cells or BMDMs were infected with wild-type icMHV-A59 or DUB-mutant virus at

368

a multiplicity of infection (MOI) of 1 in serum-free medium. After a one-hour incubation, the

369

inoculum was replaced with fresh, complete medium. Cell culture supernatants were collected at

370

indicated time points and titrated by plaque assay on 17Cl-1 cells. Titers were obtained from three

371

independent assays for each sample. Graphs of virus kinetics were generated using Prism software

372

(GraphPad Software).

373

Quantification of IFN production by RT-qPCR and ELISA

374

BMDMs in a 12-well plate were mock-infected or infected with MHV at a MOI of 1. At

375

indicated time points, monolayer cells were collected for RNA extraction and cell culture

376

supernatants were harvested for ELISA analysis. To determine IFN-11, β-actin, or MHV-A59 N

377

gene mRNA levels, total RNA was extracted from collected cells using a RNeasy Mini Kit (74104,

378

Qiagen). The first strand cDNA was synthesized from an equal amount of RNA using Rt2 HT First

379

Strand Kit (330401, Qiagen). qPCR was then performed with specific primers for mouse IFN-11

380

(PPM03050B-200, Qiagen), mouse β-actin (PPM02945B-200, Qiagen), or MHV-A59 N gene

381

using RT2 SYBR Green qPCR Mastermix (330502, Qiagen) in the Bio-Rad CFX96 system. The

382

thermocycler was set as follows: one step at 95°C (10 min), 40 cycles of 95°C (15 s), 60°C (1 min)

383

and plate read, one step at 95 °C (10 s), and a melt curve from 65°C to 95°C at increments of

384

0.5°C/0.05s. Samples were evaluated in triplicate and data are representative of three independent

385

experiments. The levels of mRNA were reported relative to β-actin mRNA and expressed as 2−ΔCT

386

[ΔCT = CT(gene of interest) − CT(β-actin)]. The secreted amount of IFN- in culture supernatants was

387

assayed using a mouse IFN- ELISA kit (BMS6027, eBioscience) according to the

388

manufacturer’s instructions.

389

Mouse experiments

390

Evaluation of MHV pathogenesis in laboratory mouse was previously described (5, 41).

391

Briefly, for intracranial infections, six-week-old C57BL/6 female mice were inoculated with 600

392

pfu of virus in 20 μL PBS. Infected mice were monitored for body weight daily and euthanized

393

when weight loss surpassed 25%. Statistical analyses of survival rate were performed using the

394

log-rank test. For intraperitoneal infection, six- or four week-old mice were injected with 6×103 or

395

6×104 pfu of virus in 100 μL PBS. Organs were collected at indicated time points and evaluated

396

for viral burden. Liver pathology was evaluated using H&E staining by the Tissue Processing Core

397

Facility at Loyola University Chicago.
