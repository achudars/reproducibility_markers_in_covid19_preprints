Abstract
Several mutant strains of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV2) are emerging. Mismatch(es) in primer/probe binding regions would decrease the
detection sensitivity of the PCR test, thereby affecting the results of clinical testing. In
this study, we conducted an in silico survey on SARS-CoV-2 sequence variability within
the binding regions of primer/probe published by the Japan National Institute of
Infectious Diseases (NIID) and Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). In
silico analysis revealed the presence of mutations in the primer/probe binding regions.
We performed RT-PCR assays using synthetic RNAs containing the mutations and
showed that some mutations significantly decreased the detection sensitivity of the RTPCR assays.
Our results highlight the importance of genomic monitoring of SARS-CoV-2 and
evaluating the effects of mismatches on PCR testing sensitivity.

Introduction
Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic is caused by the SARS-CoV-2 virus
(1), and the global number of cases has reached 63 million as of December 2020 (2).
COVID-19 infection is diagnosed via the detection of SARS-CoV-2 RNA in
nasopharyngeal, nasal, or saliva specimens by performing the RT-PCR method with the

protocol established by the National Institute of Infectious Diseases (NIID) and Centers
for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) that has been widely used in Japan.
The primers and probes for RT-PCR are designed to detect the conserved region of the
SARS-CoV-2 RNA sequence. Hence, it is crucial to assess the impact of gene mutations
observed in primer/probe binding sites on the sensitivity of SARS-CoV-2 detection.
Several in silico surveys have shown the emergence of mutant strains that exhibit
mismatches in the primer/probe binding regions; however, these studies did not assess the
effect of such mutations on PCR testing (3, 4).
Here, we conducted an in silico survey of sequence variability within the binding regions
of primers/probes used in the NIID and CDC protocols and evaluated the detection
sensitivity of RT-PCR performed using synthetic RNAs containing frequently observed
mutations. We showed that certain primer/probe-template mismatches significantly
decreased the sensitivity of RT-PCR assays. Our survey suggests the necessity of
monitoring mutations in the viral genome sequence under in silico conditions and
evaluating the impact of mutations on diagnosis sensitivity to avoid false negatives.

Materials and Methods
The whole-genome sequence data of SARS-CoV-2 were downloaded from the GISAID
database (July 6, 2020) (5). Genome data with the total length comprising less than 29,000
bases and derived from non-human hosts were excluded (59,621 sequences in total). The
region spanning from 27,500th to 29,500th base pairs of each sequence containing the
amplification region was extracted, and the sequences that contained N in this region were
filtered out (47,836 sequences in total). We aligned the primer and probe sequences
developed by NIID and CDC (Table 1) against the nucleotide sequences using glsearch36
(version 36.3.8g) (6). The frequency of occurrence of mismatch between primer and
probe sequences was calculated. For each amplification region, we selected the three most
frequently observed sequences, in addition to the sequences with mutations at the 3' end
of the primer binding sites. Oligo DNA sequences with these mutations or those identical
to the reference sequence (NC_045512.2) (1) were synthesized using GeneArt Strings
DNA Fragments (Thermo Scientific). For NIID_N1, CDC_N1, and CDC_N2, the oligos
with 150 bp upstream and downstream sequences of the amplification regions were
synthesized. For NIID_N2, the oligos with 76 bp upstream and 150 bp downstream
sequences of the amplification regions were synthesized owing to the palindromic
sequences observed at approximately 80 bp upstream of the amplification region affecting
the oligo synthesis. In vitro transcription was performed with the synthesized oligos using
the CUGA in vitro transcription kit (Nippon Gene, Tokyo, Japan), and the synthetic RNA

was purified using RNAclean XP (Beckman Coulter, CA, USA). The synthetic RNA was
quantified using NanoDrop (Thermo Scientific) and analyzed using Tapestation (Agilent
Technologies). A total of 10,000 copies of synthetic RNA were used in the assay. RT-PCR
was performed according to the manufacturer’s instructions or the manual provided by
NIID
(https://www.niid.go.jp/niid/images/epi/corona/2019-nCoVmanual20200217en.pdf) using the THUNDERBIRD Probe One-step qRT-PCR Kit (Toyobo).

Results
The alignment between the top three most frequently occurring mutations in the SARSCoV-2 virus genome and primers/probes from NIID and CDC is shown in Figure 1. The
forward primer of CDC_N1 showed one nucleotide mismatch with 1.59% (761/47,836)
of viral sequences. The incidence rates of the other mismatches were less than 0.5%,
which was set as the threshold for sequencing errors in previous studies (4, 7). The
forward primer of NIID_N1 (No.4), the reverse primer of NIID_N1 (No.5), the forward
primer of NIID_N2 (No.1), the reverse primer of CDC_N1 (No.4), and the forward primer
of CDC_N2 (No.4) had nucleotide mismatches at the 3' end of the primer binding sites
with 0.015% (7/47,836), 0.0021% (1/47,836), 0.17% (83/47,836), 0.0021% (1/47,836),
and 0.0063% (3/47,836) of viral sequences, respectively.
Next, we performed RT-PCR assays using synthetic RNA with the mismatches shown
in Table 1. As expected, when using the synthetic RNAs with mismatches at the 3' end of
the primer binding site (the forward primer of NIID_N1 (No.4), the reverse primer of
NIID_N1 (No.5), and the forward primer of CDC_N2 (No.4)), the Ct value increased
(2.77~6.29) compared to that observed when using synthetic RNA with reference
sequences. Furthermore, when RNA with a mismatch at the 3' end of the NIID_N2 primer
binding site (No.1) was used, it was not detected by PCR. In contrast, the mismatch in the
reverse primer of CDC_N1 (No.4) exerted only minor effects on the Ct value (0.51), even
though there was a mismatch at the 3' end of the primer binding site. For the reverse
primer of NIID_N1 (No.3) and the reverse primer of NIID_N2 (No.2), the mismatches in
the middle of the primer binding sites had effects on the Ct value (3.07, 4.82, respectively).

Discussion
In the present study, we conducted an in silico survey of mismatches in the binding
regions of primer/probe published by NIID and CDC, which are primarily used in Japan.
We also investigated the effects of SARS-CoV-2 genomic mutations on the detection
sensitivity of RT-PCR testing. The detection sensitivity of RT-PCR assays decreased with
most synthetic RNAs containing mutants with mismatched nucleotides at the 3' end of

the primer binding sites. However, in the case of the reverse primer of CDC_N1, a
mismatch at the 3' end of the primer had little effect on the sensitivity of RT-PCR. Some
primer mismatches in the middle of the primer binding regions had certain effects on
sensitivity. These results indicated that it is difficult to predict the effects of mismatches
on the detection sensitivity of RT-PCR assays using only in silico screening.
In both the CDC and NIID methods, the primer/probe was designed with two different
regions of the N gene (NIID_N1 and NIID_N2 for NIID, CDC_N1, and CDC_N2 for
CDC) of SARS-CoV-2. At present, no virus strains are known that exhibit mutations in
both the NIID_N1 and NIID_N2 regions or both the CDC_N1 and CDC_N2 regions.
However, to avoid false-negative diagnoses, it is important to monitor mutations in the
viral genome sequence and evaluate the effects of these mutations on the detection
sensitivity not only under in silico as well as experimental conditions.
