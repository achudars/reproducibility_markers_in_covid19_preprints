Abstract

12

Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is a global health concern as it continues to spread

13

within China and beyond. The causative agent of this disease, severe acute respiratory

14

syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), belongs to the genus Betacoronavirus which also

15

includes severe acute respiratory syndrome related coronavirus (SARSr-CoV) and Middle

16

East respiratory syndrome related coronavirus (MERSr-CoV). Codon usage of viral genes are

17

believed to be subjected to different selection pressures in different host environments.

18

Previous studies on codon usage of influenza A viruses can help identify viral host origins

19

and evolution trends, however, similar studies on coronaviruses are lacking. In this study,

20

global correspondence analysis (CA), within-group correspondence analysis (WCA) and

21

between-group correspondence analysis (BCA) were performed among different genes in

22

coronavirus viral sequences. The amino acid usage pattern of SARS-CoV-2 was generally

23

found similar to bat and human SARSr-CoVs. However, we found greater synonymous

24

codon usage differences between SARS-CoV-2 and its phylogenetic relatives on spike and

25

membrane genes, suggesting these two genes of SARS-CoV-2 are subjected to different

26

evolutionary pressures.

Introduction

31

A novel coronavirus outbreak took place in Wuhan, Hubei province, China in December

32

20191. This novel coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) causes pneumonia in patients2 and it has

33

rapidly spread to other provinces in China and other countries 3. This novel coronavirus

34

outbreak had raised global concern but current knowledge on the origin and transmission

35

route of the pathogen is still limited. The SARS-CoV-2 belongs to the genus Betacoronavirus,

36

which also includes two highly virulent human coronaviruses, SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV.

37

Apart from human, many animal species, such as bat, rat, camel, swine and hedgehog, can be

38

infected by different types of coronaviruses. Further sequence analyses of this novel and

39

other betacoronaviruses might provide additional information to better understand the

40

evolution of SARS-CoV-2.

41

Preferential codon usage is commonly seen in different organisms, and it has been evident

42

that the uneven codon usage is not neutral but related to gene expression or other selection

43

pressures 4–6. There are two levels of codon usage biases, one is at amino acid level and the

44

other is at synonymous codon level. The amino acid composition of proteins can be an

45

important factor that explaining certain sequence traits. For example integral membrane

46

proteins that are enriched in hydrophobic amino acids can create significant codon usage

47

bias7. Amino acid composition sometime can also introduce confounding effects when one

48

only focuses on studying the variations of synonymous codon usage. The use of global

49

correspondence analysis (CA) and its derivatives within-group correspondence analysis

50

(WCA) and between-group correspondence analysis (BCA) to analyze codon usages can

51

overcome the above problem. In fact, WCA becomes “model of choice” for analyzing

52

synonymous codon usage in recent years, as it is more robust than other traditional methods

53

(e.g. CA with relative codon frequency or CA with RSCU values)7,8. This analytic approach,

54

however, has not been used in studying viral sequences. As the natural history of the SARS-

55

CoV-2 remains largely unknown, an in-depth codon usage analysis of this newly emerging

56

virus might provide some novel insights.

57

In this study, we used both CA and WCA to analyses codon usage patterns of a vast number

58

of betacoronavirus sequences. We found SARS-CoV-2 and bat SARSr-CoV have similar

59

amino acid usage. However, our analyses suggested that the spike and member genes of

60

SARS-CoV-2 have rather distinct synonymous codon usage patterns.

Methods

62

Sequence data

63

To construct a reference sequence dataset, available full-length complete genome sequences

64

of coronavirus were collected through Virus Pathogen Resource database

65

(https://www.viprbrc.org/brc/home.spg?decorator=corona, accessed 13 Jul 2019, ticket

66

958868915368). The sequences were filtered by the following steps: (1) Remove sequences

67

without protein annotation, (2) Keep only sequences with complete set of desired replicase

68

and structural proteins (sequences coding for orf1ab, spike, membrane and nucleocapsid), (3)

69

Filter out sequences that are unusually long and short (>130% or <70% of the median length

70

for each group of gene sequences), (4) Limit our analysis to genus Betacoronavirus and (5)

71

Concatenate orf1a and orf1b sequences to form orf1ab if necessary.

72

The final dataset comprised 769 individual strains (3076 individual gene sequences) that

73

contain complete sets of coding regions for orf1ab, spike, membrane and nucleocapsid genes

74

(see Supplementary Figure 1). The sequences for envelope gene were not included in the

75

analysis because of the short length and potential bias in codon usage. Corresponding

76

metadata for the sequences were extracted by the sequence name field. 24 complete genome

77

sequences of the newly identified SARS-CoV-2 and its phylogenetically close relatives were

78

retrieved from Genbank and GISAID (accessed 22 Jan 2020). Six genomes in this study were

79

used as special references (BetaCoV/bat/Yunnan/RaTG13/2013|EPI_ISL_402131;

to have close phylogenetic relationship with SARS-CoV-29–11. Detailed accession ID for the

86

above data are provided in the Supplementary Table S1.

87

The codon count for every gene sequence input for the correspondence analysis was

88

calculated by the SynMut12 package. The implementation of the different correspondence

89

analyses in this study was performed by functions in the package ade413. Three stop codons

90

(TAA, TAG and TGA) were excluded in the correspondence analysis.

91

Global correspondence analysis (CA) on codon usage

92

Correspondence analysis (CA) is a dimension reduction method which is well suited for

93

amino acid and codon usage analysis. The concept in correspondence analysis is similar to

94

Pearson’s χଶ test (i.e., the expected counts are calculated under the hypothesis of

95

independence, based on the observed contingency table). With the deduced expected count

96

table, the Euclidean distance or the χଶ distance can be used to evaluate the difference between

97

two observations. The χଶ distance that we are using in the global correspondence analysis is

98

applied for the row profile (adjusted for the size effect among difference genes) and the

99

column profile (adjusted for the size effect among difference codons) and therefore the raw

100

codon count rather than the Relative Synonymous Codon Usage (RSCU) values are more

101

informative and suitable input for our model. The calculation of the χଶ distance is included in

102

the Supplementary Method.

103

All the correspondence analyses in this study were performed individually for each gene, to

104

achieve better resolution on gene specific codon usage pattern.

105

Within-group correspondence analysis and between-group correspondence analysis

106

In contrast to the ordinary correspondence analysis, the within-block correspondence

107

analysis14 (WCA) can segregate the effects of different codon compositions in different

108

amino acids. WCA has been recognized as the most accurate and effective CA method for

109

studying the synonymous codon usage in various genomic profile8. WCA focuses on the

110

within-amino acid variability, and it technically excludes the variation of amino acid usage

111

differences. WCA was implemented based on the existing global CA, with additional

112

information for factoring.

113

Between-group correspondence analysis (BCA) is complementary to WCA; BCA focuses on

114

the between-group variability. BCA can be interpreted as the CA on amino acid usage. We

115

used BCA in this study to investigate the amino acid usage pattern in different coronaviruses.

116

Grand Average of Hydropathy (GRAVY) score

117

Gravy score provides an easy way to estimate the hydropathy character of a protein15. It was

118

used in this study as a proxy to identify proteins that are likely to be membrane-bound

119

proteins. The GRAVY score was calculated in a linear form on codon frequencies as:

Results

124

General sequence features in Betacoronavirus

125

A total of 3,076 individual gene sequences passed the filtering criteria and were included in

126

this study. Viral sequences from 3 different species (Middle East respiratory syndrome

127

related coronavirus (MERSr-CoV), Betacoronavirus 1, SARS related coronavirus (SARSr-

128

Cov)) were the three most dominant species (see Supplementary Figure S1) in the filtered

129

dataset.

130

Four conserved protein sequence encoding regions of Betacoronavirus were analysed

131

separately. The median lengths of the studied sequence regions were 21237 nt for orf1ab

132

gene, 4062 nt for spike gene, 660 nt for membrane gene and 1242 nt for nucleocapsid gene.

133

Spike gene has the lowest average and median G + C contents among these four genes

134

(median: 37.45%, 37.31%, 42.60% and 47.22% for orf1ab, spike, membrane and

135

nucleocapsid respectively). The G +C contents of the orf1ab and spike genes were found

136

distributed in bi-modal patterns, and the G + C contents of SARS-CoV-2 were found located

137

at the lesser half of the data of these two genes. The G + C contents for membrane and

138

nucleocapsid genes of studied viral sequences were distributed in unimodal pattern (see

139

Supplementary Figure S2).

140

The overall amino acid and codon usage of the dataset are plotted in an ascending order

141

(Figure 1). We observed that leucine and valine were the two most frequently used amino

142

acids in the four studied genes, while tryptophan, histidine and methionine were the three

143

least used ones. We also found that codons ending with cytosine or guanine were generally

144

less frequent than the codons ending with adenine or thymine. This pattern of uneven usage

145

in synonymous codons is in accordance with the G + C content distribution results (codons

146

ending with guanine or cytosine were less frequently observed).

147

We found a substantial bias in amino acid usage among these four genes, and this bias is well

148

explained by the hydropathy of the encoded proteins (results from global correspondence

149

analysis on all the four genes, collectively, data not shown). The GRAVY scores for every

150

sequence were calculated to represent the degree of hydropathy. We discovered that the

151

nucleocapsid protein sequences had significantly lower GRAVY scores as compared to those

152

from other genes, while the membrane protein sequences had highest GRAVY scores (see

153

Supplementary Figure S3).

154

Correspondence analysis

155

We first conducted a multivariate analysis of codon usage on the dataset by using global

156

correspondence analysis. We also conducted WCA and BCA to study these sequences at

157

synonymous codon usage and amino acid usage levels, respectively. Given that there were

158

different amino acid usage biases among different genes (Supplementary Figure S3), we

159

performed correspondence analyses of these genes separately.

160

Of all the four correspondence analyses for the four genes, the extracted first factors

161

explained more than 50% of the total variance (see Supplementary Figure S4). The first two

162

factors in orf1ab global CA represented 67.7% and 16.8% of total inertia. Similarly, the first

163

two factors of the spike, membrane and nucleocapsid global CA represented 51.0% and

164

18.5%, 52.6% and 20.2%, and 54.8% and 14.2%, respectively, of total inertia. With only

165

these two factors, we could extract ∼70% of the variability of the overall codon usage for

166

each studied gene. These levels of representations were higher than or similar to those

167

deduced from other codon usage analyses8,17,18.

168

The overall codon usage of SARS-CoV-2 in orf1ab, spike and membrane genes are

169

similar to those of bat and pangolin CoVs

170

Based on the above CA analysis, the data points are shown in different colours that represent

171

different features of the sequences (e.g. viral host or viral species). There were no

172

neighbouring human viruses around SARS-CoV-2 in CA results of orf1ab, spike and

173

membrane (Figure 2), suggesting that the overall codon usage of SARS-CoV-2 in the orf1ab,

174

spike or membrane gene was significantly different from those of human betacoronaviruses.

175

By contrast, the nucleocapsid genes of SARS coronavirus and SARS-CoV-2 are found to be

176

relatively similar (Supplementary Figure S5A). Except for the nucleocapsid gene, virus

177

sequences adjacent to the SARS-CoV-2 were all from bat coronaviruses (coloured in purple

178

in Figure 2).

179

There are five groups of viral sequences of human origin in the dataset (SARS-CoV-2,

180

Betacoronavirus 1, human coronavirus HKU 1, MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV). These five

181

groups of viral sequences were well separated from each other in terms of codon usage,

182

except the nucleocapsid gene sequences of SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV as mentioned

bioRxiv preprint doi: https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.02.15.950568; this version posted February 25, 2020. The copyright holder for this preprint

183

above. There was no overlap between SARS-CoV-2 and human SARS-CoV in orf1ab, spike

184

and membrane, yet SARS-CoV codon usage processed more similar to SARS-CoV-2

185

compared to the other three types of human coronaviruses (i.e. yellow point always closest to

186

SARS-CoV-2 in Supplementary Figure S5A).

187

Compared to human coronavirus sequences, the bat coronavirus sequences have more

188

scattered codon usage, even within the same viral species (Supplementary S5B). Some viral

189

species in bats formed their own clusters in all four genes (e.g. SARSr-CoV). SARSr-CoV is

190

a group of coronavirus that can be found in both humans and bats. We observed that the data

191

points of human SARSr-CoV are clustered with those of bat SARSr-CoV in all the four genes

192

(by comparing the yellow points in Supplementary Figure S5A and S5B). The codon usage of

193

SARS-CoV-2 in orf1ab, spike and membrane were slightly different from the SARS-CoV

194

clusters and these data points are located in between SARSr-CoV and other coronavirus

195

species (e.g. MERSr-CoV and bat coronavirus HKU9 etc.)

196

The global codon usages of bat RatG13 virus were found most similar to SARS-CoV-2 in

197

orf1ab, spike and nucleocapsid genes, but not in membrane gene (Figure. 2). In the analysis

198

of membrane protein, pangolin P1E virus had a more similar codon usage to SARS-CoV-2

199

than all the other viruses. We found the similarity in codon usage between pangolin P1E and

200

SARS-CoV-2 were also high in orf1ab, where P1E was the second closest data point to

201

SARS-CoV-2. But this is not the case for spike and nucleocapsid genes.

202

We also observed that the codon usage pattern in spike gene was more complex than in other

203

genes. For example, data points adjacent to the spike gene of SARS-CoV-2 were

204

coronaviruses from bat, human and rodent hosts (Figure 2). The codon usage of rodent

205

coronaviruses was generally distinct from human or bat coronaviruses in orf1ab, membrane

206

and nucleocapsid gene sequences. By contrast, the spike gene sequences of murine

207

coronaviruses were found located between SARSr-CoV and other coronaviruses, just like

208

SARS-CoV-2 (Figure 2 and Supplementary Figure S6B). The codon usage from camel, swine

209

and other coronaviruses were found to be well clustered and relatively distant to SARS-CoV-

210

2 (see Supplementary Figure S6A, S5C, S5D).

211

The codon usage at synonymous level suggested novel patterns of SARS-CoV-2 in spike

212

and membrane genes

213

WCA and BCA were used to further differentiate codon usage of these betacoronaviruses at

214

synonymous codon usage and amino acid usage levels, respectively. After applying the row-

bioRxiv preprint doi: https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.02.15.950568; this version posted February 25, 2020. The copyright holder for this preprint

215

block structure to the original global CA model, we found that most of the variability in

216

codon usage can be explained at synonymous codon usage level (90.36% for orf1ab gene,

217

85.29% for spike gene, 83.71% for member gene and 84.07% for nucleocapsid gene) (Table

218

1).

219

Results from the BCA suggested that the amino acid usage of SARS-CoV-2 is closely related

220

to bat and human SARSr-CoVs in all four genes (Figure 3B and Figure 4B). Specifically, we

221

discovered that the SARS-CoV-2 had amino acid usage pattern most similar to bat RaTG13

222

virus, followed by pangolin P1E, bat CovVZC45 and bat CoVZXC21. The sequences of

223

BtKY72 and BM48-31 were from a more phylogenetically distant clade, and, accordingly,

224

they had relatively distinct amino acid usage to SARS-CoV-2 as expected in all four studied

225

genes. This result agrees with the result in the full-genome phylogenetic analysis

226

(Supplementary Figure S7).

227

The difference between SARS-CoV-2 and RaTG13 at synonymous codon usage level was

228

marginal in orf1ab and nucleocapsid sequences. Interestingly, there were noticeable

229

differences in the spike and membrane gene analyses. Our results suggest the synonymous

230

codon usage patterns in the spike and membrane gene of SARS-CoV-2 are different from

231

those of its genetically related viruses (i.e. RaTG13 and other reference relatives). For

232

example, the synonymous codon usage pattern of SARS-CoV-2 was found to be closer to a

233

cluster of rodent murine coronaviruses at the first two factorial levels (Figure 3A and Figure

234

4A).

235

Further analysis on spike gene, however, suggested that the codon usage of SARS-CoV-2 and

236

rodent murine coronaviruses were distinct at the third factorial level (Supplementary Figure

237

S8A). The results show that although RaTG13 was not the point most adjacent to SARS-

238

CoV-2 at the first and second dimension, it surpassed murine coronaviruses at the third

239

dimension. Our results suggest a complex genomic background in the spike gene of SARS-

240

CoV-2, which made its synonymous codon usage harder to differentiate from other genomic

241

sequences in our WCA analysis. Despite the proximity between RaTG13 and SARS-CoV-2

242

at three-dimensional level, they were still formed into two separated clusters (Supplementary

243

Figure S8A). It is evident that the synonymous codon usage pattern of SARS-CoV-2 is

244

distinct from other bat origin coronaviruses. The difference in synonymous codon usage is

245

largely explained by the first factor (more than 50%), and our analysis on codon usages

246

suggest that the first factor maybe highly related to the preferential usage of codons ending

247

with cytosine (Supplementary Figure S9). We also had similar observation for the membrane

248

gene. Our three-dimensional analysis revealed that the synonymous codon usage of SARS-

249

CoV-2 in membrane was most similar to P1E and CoVZXC21 (Supplementary Figure S8B).

250

It is worth noting that comparing to RaTG13, P1E and CoVZXC21 had lower synonymous

251

codon usage similarity to SARS-CoV-2 in the other three genes.

252

Overall, our WCA results support a more complex synonymous codon usage background on

253

spike and membrane genes, though we identified unique codon usage patterns of SARS-CoV-

254

2 on these two genes.

255
256

Discussion

257

Codon usage can be affected by many sequence features, including nucleotide composition,

258

dinucleotide composition, amino acid preference, host adaption, etc8,19,20. The codon usages

259

of viral sequences can vary by genes and host origins21–23. The bias in codon usage is a

260

unique and distinctive characteristic that can reflect the “signature” of a genomic sequence.

261

Codon usage analyses are often complementary to ordinary sequence alignment-based

262

analyses which focus on the genetic distance at nucleotide level, whereas codon usage

263

analyses enable capturing signals at different sequence parameters. Therefore, codon usage

264

bias can be another good proxy for identifying unique traits (e.g. virus origin, host origin, or

265

some functions of proteins) of a genome. The goal of this study was to investigate the codon

266

usage bias of betacoronaviruses. By studying the codon usags of these viruses in a systematic

267

manner, we identified viral sequences carrying traits similar to those of SARS-CoV-2, which

268

provided useful information for studying the host origin and evolutionary history of SARS-

269

CoV-2.

270

The codon usage of different genes in betacoronaviruses are very different. The G+C content,

271

especially the GC3 content is known to be influential to the codon usage of some bacteria and

272

viruses 7,24,25. The GC3 content has pronounced effects on our WCA analysis of the orf1ab

273

and spike genes. The GC3 content was found correlated with high WCA values on the first

274

factor of orf1ab (Supplementary Figure S9). By contrast, codons ending with cytosine had

275

lower factorial values in the spike gene analysis (Supplementary Figure S9). The G + C

276

contents in membrane and nucleocapsid genes were less suppressed (Supplementary Figure

277

S2). This can be partly explained by the fact that membrane and nucleocapsid are two genes

278

with shorter lengths which may limit the flexibilities for mutation or codon usage adaptation.

279

In addition to global CA analysis, the application of WCA and BCA can eliminate the effects

280

caused by amino acid compositions and synonymous codon usage, respectively. These

281

alternative analytical tools were important to our study. It is because the amino acid

282

sequences are expected to be more conserved such that they can preserve biological functions

283

of the translated genes. By contrast, mutations at synonymous level tend to be more frequent,

284

as most of these codon alternatives do not affect the biological function of a protein.

285

Of all the existing genomes in the dataset, RaTG13 best matched the overall codon usage

286

pattern of the SARS-CoV-2. Although the SARS-CoV-2 had amino acid usage similar to bat

287

and human SARSr-CoVs, the synonymous codon usages between them were relatively

288

different, which indicates similar protein characteristics but maybe different evolutionary

289

histories. The codon usage of bat coronaviruses are more scattered than coronaviruses of

290

other hosts. This result agrees with the fact that bat is a major host reservoir of coronavirus26,

291

thus it harbours coronaviruses with more complex genomic backgrounds.

292

SARS-CoV-2 was first identified in human, but its codon usage pattern is very different from

293

those of other human betacoroanviruses (Supplementary Figure S5A). In fact, the codon

294

usage at both the amino acid level and synonymous level denote that the orf1ab gene in

295

SARS-CoV-2 had closest relationship to SARSr-CoV, especially RaTG13. The CoVZX45

296

and CoVZXC21 had similar amino acid usage but relatively different synonymous codon

297

usage to SARS-CoV-2 (Figure 3). Besides bat-origin SARSr-CoV, the pangolin P1E also had

298

similar codon usage to SARS-CoV-2 both at amino acid and synonymous codon levels. The

299

result in orf1ab is in accordance with the full-genome phylogenetic analysis (Supplementary

300

Figure S7), showing a close relationship between SARS-CoV-2 and RaTG13 by the overall

301

backbone of the genome.

302

The S protein is responsible for receptor binding which is important for viral entry. The

303

genetic variability is extreme in spike gene27, and this highly mutable gene may possess

304

valuable information about recent evolution history. In our results, the synonymous codon

305

usage of SARS-CoV-2 in spike gene was distinct from those of RaTG13 and other

306

phylogenetic relatives (Figure 3A), which was not observed in orf1ab or nucleocapsid gene.

307

Although the codon usage in spike of SARS-CoV-2, RaTG13 and P1E were similar at amino

308

acid level, the difference at synonymous codon usage level indicates that they are unlikely to

309

share a very recent common ancestor. It is more likely that SARS-CoV-2, RaTG13 and P1E

310

might have undergone different evolution pathways for a certain period of time. The amino

311

acid usage of SARS-CoV-2 in membrane was clustered with bat SARSr-CoV, however the

312

synonymous codon usage of SARS-CoV-2 was still distinct to these bat coronaviruses.

313

Notably, in membrane gene, pangolin P1E had a more similar synonymous codon usage to

314

SARS-CoV-2 than RaTG13. These findings suggest that there may be different selection

315

forces between genes. Our result supports different evolutionary background or currently

316

unknown host adaption history in SARS-CoV-2. The codon usage of SARS-CoV-2 in

317

nucleocapsid gene was similar to bat SARSr-CoV both at amino acid level and synonymous

318

level, suggesting that no highly significant mutation happened in this gene.

319

Codon usage can be shaped by many different selection forces, including the influence from

320

host factors. Some researchers have hypothesised that the codon usage in SARS-CoV-2

321

maybe directly correlated to the codon usage of its host28. However our recent study on

322

influenza A viruses implied that these may not be the most influential factors shaping the

323

codon usage of a viral genome19. Our analysis took advantage of the existing genomes of

324

Betacoronavirus to study the complex host effect on codon usage, which warrants more

325

accurate but relatively conserved estimation.
