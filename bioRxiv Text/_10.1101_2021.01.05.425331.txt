Abstract: There is an urgent need for new antivirals with powerful therapeutic potential and tolerable
side effects. In the present study, we found that recombinant human interferon-alpha (IFNa) triggered
cell intrinsic and extrinsic antiviral responses and reduced replication of severe acute respiratory
syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) in human lung epithelial Calu-3 cells. However, IFNa alone was
insufficient to completely abolish SARS-CoV-2 replication. Combinations of IFNa with camostat,

remdesivir, EIDD-2801, cycloheximide or convalescent serum showed strong synergy and effectively
inhibited SARS-CoV-2 infection. Additionally, we demonstrated synergistic antiviral activity of IFNa2a
with pimodivir against influenza A virus (FluAV) infection in human lung epithelial A549 cells, as well
as of IFNa2a with lamivudine against human immunodeficiency virus 1 (HIV-1) infection in human
TZM-bl cells. Our results indicate that IFNa2a-based combinational therapies help to reduce drug dose
and improve efficacy in comparison with monotherapies, making them attractive targets for further preclinical and clinical development.

Introduction
Every year, emerging and re-emerging viruses surface from natural reservoirs to infect, disable, and
kill people [1, 2]. These outbreaks can be devastating to public health and have the capacity to ruin local
and global economies when left unaddressed. According to the World Health Organization, there is an
urgent need for better control of emerging and re-emerging viral diseases, including COVID-19.
Antiviral drugs are powerful tools to combat emerging viral diseases. Among these are recombinant
human interferons (IFNs), which have been approved as a monotherapy for treatment of hepatitis C virus
(HCV) and hepatitis B virus (HBV) infections [3]. They have also been shown to be effective against other
viruses in clinical trials and in laboratory settings [4-6]. Due to their broad activity, IFNs can be
considered broad-spectrum antivirals.
IFNs are a large class of host proteins that trigger an innate defense against viruses [7, 8]. They are
classified into three groups, according to the cellular receptor they bind. Type I IFNs consist of IFN-alpha
(IFNa), IFN-beta (IFNb), IFN-epsilon, IFN-kappa and IFN-omega (IFNw) and bind to the IFN-alpha/beta
receptor (IFNAR1/2). Type II IFNs consist of IFN-gamma (IFNg) and interact with IFNGR1/2. Finally,
type III IFNs, consisting of IFN-lambda-1/IL29 (IFNl1), IFN-lambda-2/IL28A (IFNl2), IFN-lambda-3/IL28B
(IFNl3) and IFN-lambda-4 (IFNl4), pass signals through a receptor complex consisting of interleukin (IL)
IL10R2 and IFNLR1 [9].
IFNs also induce transcription of interferon-stimulated genes (ISGs), which participate in intrinsic
antiviral and extrinsic immune responses. For example, ISGs, such as IFIT1 and OASL, activate
Ribonuclease L (RNaseL), which leads to the degradation of viral RNA [10]. ISGs such as interleukins
(ILs), C-X-C and C-C motif chemokines (CXCLs and CCLs) recruit immune cells to the site of infection.
Notably, mutations in IFN-signaling pathway genes have resulted in increased susceptibility to viral
infections and reduced survival of patients [11-14].

However, recombinant IFNs possess limited antiviral efficacy and can cause adverse effects when
used as monotherapies [15]. For example IFNb has been used on hospitalized patients with COVID-19
with no or limited efficacy, as indicated by overall mortality, initiation of ventilation, and duration of
hospital stay [16, 17].
Synergistic combinations of IFNs with other antiviral drugs can increase effectiveness and overcome
toxicities by countering biological compensation, allowing for reduced doses of each compound to be
used (Fig. S1). For example, combination treatment of IFNa and ribavirin has been the “gold standard”
for treatment of chronic HCV infection for more than decade. Additionally, a combination of IFNb1b,
lopinavir–ritonavir, and ribavirin has been tested for treatment of hospitalized patients with COVID-19 in
an open-label, randomized, phase II trial [18]. Combined use of IFNa2b and IFNg has also been evaluated
in patients positive to SARS-CoV-2 [19]. Finally, combined use of IFNa and arbidol has been tested in a
cohort of confirmed COVID-19 cases in Wuhan, China [20]. These treatments were shown to positively
impact the resolution of the COVID-19 symptoms.
Here, we identified several novel synergistic IFNa2a-based drug combinations against SARS-CoV-2,
FluAV and HIV-1. These treatment combinations were effective at lower concentrations compared to
IFNa2a monotherapies. We also propose the need for further investigation due to their powerful
treatment potential, which can be leveraged for use in response to imminent viral threats including the
emergence and re-emergence of viruses, immune-evading or drug-resistant variants, and viral coinfections.

Results
Type I IFNs reduce SARS-CoV-2 replication in vitro more efficiently than type II and III IFNs
Although dexamethasone has been shown to improve survival of patients with severe or critical
COVID-19 [21], there are currently no curative therapies against SARS-CoV-2. However, previous studies
have uncovered several potent antiviral agents including IFNs against SARS-CoV-2 in vitro and in vivo
[4, 5, 22]. Here, we tested type I, II, and III IFNs against wild type SARS-CoV-2 in Calu-3 and Vero-E6
cells using cell viability and virus plaque reduction assays as readouts. We observed that type I IFNs
rescued both cell types from virus-mediated death and reduced SARS-CoV-2 replication more efficiently
than type II and III IFNs. However, the rescue was only partial, and virus replication was reduced only
by 2-3-folds (Fig. 1).

Type I IFNs reduce the SARS-CoV-2 RNA replication and accelerate virus-mediated induction of cellular type III
IFNs, IFNb1 and ISGs
To shed more light on the mechanism of action of type I IFNs, we evaluated their effect on
expression of cellular genes and transcription of viral RNA in mock- and SARS-CoV-2-infected Calu-3
cells. For this, cells were treated with 1 µg/mL of type I IFNs or vehicle and infected with virus or mock.
After 24 h, we analyzed polyadenylated RNA using RNA-sequencing. We found that type I IFNs
attenuated production of viral RNA (Fig. 2a), while increasing expression of many ISGs in both mockand virus-infected cells (Fig. 2b). These include IFIT1, IFIT2 and IFIT3, which play a role in recognition of
viral RNA; OASL and OAS2, which are involved in RNase L-mediated RNA degradation; and IDO1
which is essential for kynurenine biosynthesis [23-26]. Interestingly, type I IFNs boosted virus-activated
expression of type III IFNs (IFNl1, IFNl2, IFNl3 and IFNl4) as well as IFNb1, which belongs to type I IFN.
These results indicate that type I IFNs not only trigger expression of ISGs regardless of infection, but also
amplify expression of other interferons usually activated by viral infections.
Next, we studied the effect of type I IFNs on the metabolism of mock- and SARS-CoV-2 -infected
Calu-3 cells. We analyzed mainly polar metabolites in cell cultures at 24 hpi (Fig. S2; Fig. S2). A total of 93
metabolites were quantified. Viral infection substantially lowered tyrosine and 4-hydroxyproline levels
(log2FC<-2). Regardless of viral infection, administration of type I IFNs lowered the levels of several
metabolites including tryptophan while increasing kynurenine (log2FC>3; Fig. 2c). This indicates that type
I IFNs activate IDO1-mediated kynurenine biosynthesis, which is responsible for adverse reactions such
as suppression of T-cell responses, pain hypersensitivity and behavior disturbance [27].

IFNa1b, IFNa2a and IFNw1 are more effective than IFNb1a against SARS-CoV-2 in Calu-3 cells
To identify the type I IFN with most activity against SARS-CoV-2 infection, we infected IFN-treated
and IFN-untreated Calu-3 cells with SARS-CoV-2-mCherry (moi 0.01) and collected media from the cells
(P1) after 48 h. The media were diluted 25-fold and applied to noninfected cells for another 48 h (P2).
Mock-infected cells were used as controls. The experiment is schematically depicted in Fig. 3a.
Fluorescence microscopy, fluorescence intensity analysis, and cell viability assay of P1 and P2 cells
showed that IFNa1b, IFNa2a and IFNw1 were more effective inhibitors of SARS-CoV-2 infection than
IFNb1a. However, none of the IFNs tested able to inhibit virus infection completely (Fig. 3b-d).

Anti-SARS-CoV-2 activity of IFNa2a depends on virus load and time of addition

IFNas are widely used in basic research to elucidate biological activities, structure and mechanism of
action of type I IFNs. They are encoded by multiple genes and vary slightly from one another in their
protein structure. We tested IFNa2a against various doses of SARS-CoV-2-mCherry in Calu-3 cells. Calu3 cells were treated with 1 µg/mL IFNa2a, then infected with SARS-CoV-2-mCherry at the indicated moi.
After 48 h, fluorescent intensity and cell viability analysis were performed. We found that efficacy of
IFNa2a treatment in preventing SARS-CoV-2 infection was dependent on virus load, decreasing in
efficacy as moi increases (Fig. 4a).
We also tested whether time of IFNa2a addition could influence its anti-SARS-CoV-2 activity. To this
end, we treated Calu-3 cells with 1 µg/mL IFNa2a at indicated time points and infected the cells with
SARS-CoV-2-mCherry (moi = 0.01). After 48 h of infection, fluorescent intensity and cell viability analysis
were performed. We found that efficacy of IFNa2a treatment was dependent on time of administration,
showing more efficacy when given prior virus infection than following infection (Fig. 4b).

Synergistic IFNa2a-based Combinations Against SARS-CoV-2 infection
Next, we examined whether combinations of IFNa2a with several known inhibitors of SARS-CoV-2
infection can protect cells from virus infection more efficiently than IFNa2a alone. For this, we first
confirmed antiviral activities of remdesivir, EIDD-2801, camostat, cycloheximide, and convalescent serum
[28-32] on Calu-3 cells using SARS-CoV-2-mCherry (Fig. S3). Then, we tested the antiviral efficacy of
these agents in combination with IFNa2a in Calu-3 cells by monitoring virus-mediated mCherry
expression and cell viability. Each drug combination was tested in a 6×6 dose-response matrix, where 5
doses of single drugs are combined in a pairwise manner. As a result, we obtained dose-response
matrices demonstrating virus inhibition and cell viability achieved by each combination (Fig 5a,b; Fig.
S4). We plotted synergy distribution maps, showing synergy at each pairwise dose. For each drug
combination, we calculated ZIP synergy scores and most synergistic area scores (Fig. 5c). We observed
that all combinations were synergistic based on fluorescent intensity or cell viability analyses (synergy
scores >10). However, camostat-IFNa2a and convalescent plasma-IFNa2a were the most active in terms of
both dose-response effect and synergism. This high synergy allowed us to substantially decrease the
concentration of both components (especially IFNa2a) to achieve antiviral efficacy that was comparable to
those of individual drugs at high concentrations.
Based on our transcriptomics and metabolomics analysis of anti-SARS-CoV-2 activity of IFNa2a and
literature review on remdesivir, EIDD-2801, camostat, cycloheximide, and convalescent serum, we
propose the following mechanism of action of the drug combinations. Fig. 6d shows that IFNa2a induces

transcription of ISGs including IFIT1, IFIT2 and IFIT3, which recognize viral RNA; OASL and OAS2,
which are involved in RNase L-mediated RNA degradation; and IDO1, which catalyzes kynurenine
biosynthesis. IFNa2a also facilitates expression of several cytokines and virus-activated synthesis of
IFNL1, IFNL2, IFNL3, IFNL4, and IFNB1, which alarm the neighboring cells of upcoming infection.
Convalescent serum contains neutralizing antibodies which bind S protein of SARS-CoV-2 preventing
virus entry into the cells [16]. Camostat, a serine protease inhibitor, reduces SARS-CoV-2-cell membrane
fusion by binding host TMPRSS2 [33]. In addition, camostat possesses some potential beneficial
immunomodulatory effects by interfering with the bradykinin/kallikrein pathways [34]. Remdesivir and
EIDD-2801 are nucleoside analogues which inhibit viral RNA synthesis [30, 35]. Cycloheximide inhibits
translation elongation and, thereby, reduces SARS-CoV-2 replication [29]. Therefore, a combination of
therapies that works to bolster innate immune response while targeting viral entry or replication may
work together to inhibit infection within a virus-host system. These combinations lowered toxicity and
improved efficacy in comparison with monotherapies in vitro, making them attractive targets for further
pre-clinical and clinical development.

Novel IFNa2a-based Combinations Against FluAV Infections
In order to extend our findings beyond SARS-CoV-2, we tested IFNa2a in combinations with known
influenza inhibitors ofemetine, flavopiridol, camostat, obatoclax, SNS-032, gemcitabine, monensin,
cycloheximide or pimodivir [10, 36, 37] against FluAV infection in A549 cells. Cell viability was measured
after 48 h in FluAV- and mock-infected cells to determine efficiency and toxicity of each compound and
their combinations with IFNa2a (Fig. 6). We observed that combination of IFNa2a and pimodivir was
synergistic against FluAV infection (ZIP synergy score: 22.13, the most synergistic area score: 42.77) while
remaining nontoxic at synergistic doses for either drug. Given that pimodivir (VX-787, JNJ-63623872) is
an orally available anti-FluAV agent which inhibits cap-snatching domain of viral polymerase basic
protein 2 [38] and has shown promising results in Phase II clinical trials [39], we believe that its
combination with IFNa warrants further preclinical and clinical investigations.

Novel IFNa2a-based Combinations Against HIV-1 Infections
We also tested IFNa2a in combination with known anti-retrovirals agents, lamivudine, brequinar,
tenofovir, suramin, clofarabine and decitabine [40-43] against HIV-1 in TZM-bl cells. Cell viability and
HIV-induced luciferase expression were measured for each compound or their combination with IFNa2a

after 48 h. We identified that IFNa2a and lamivudine in combination was most effective while being
nontoxic at synergistic drug concentrations, with ZIP synergy scores of 5.7 and ZIP synergy score of 11.4
at the most synergistic area (Fig. 7). Given that lamivudine (3TC) is an orally available anti-HIV drug
which inhibits viral reverse transcriptase [44], we believe that its combination with IFNa also warrants
further preclinical and clinical investigations.

Discussion
Monotherapies are mainly used to treat emerging viral infections due to lack of studies on drugdrug interactions [45]. Here, we have reported several novel synergistic IFNa-based combinations that
have better efficacy than single drug therapies. In particular, we report novel anti-SARS-CoV-2 activities
of IFNa2a in combination with remdesivir, EIDD-2801, camostat, cycloheximide, and convalescent serum
in vitro. The capacity to deliver these combinations through different routes could provide a path for
effective treatment of COVID-19 patients at different stages of diseases [33, 46, 47]. Thus, combination of
these drugs with IFNa2a could be of relevance for patients, including patients with immune suppression
including lymphopenia.
We also identified synergistic activity in the combined administration of IFNa2a with the
investigational orally available pimodivir against FluAV, as well as of IFNa2a and approved orally
available lamivudine against HIV-1 infection. These combinations may provide a relatively convenient
treatment option that can be administered outside of a hospital setting.
Interestingly, pimodivir, lamivudine, remdesivir, and EIDD-2801 could interfere with synthesis of
viral nucleic acids but not with the development of innate immune response [30, 35, 38, 48]. This supports
the clinical use of IFNa-remdesivir (or EIDD-2801), IFNa-pimodivir and IFNa-lamivudine combinations
as a treatment for SARS-CoV-2, FluAV and HIV-1 infections, respectively.
Thus, we have identified combination treatments that reduce viral replication in vitro at lower
concentrations than is required with monotherapies. The low effective doses of combination drugs may
have several clinical advantages, including improved patient outcome and fewer adverse events
associated with IFN-mediated hypercytokinemia, suppression of T-cell response, pain hypersensitivity,
and behavior disturbance [23]. We believe further development of these antiviral combinations can lead
to practical treatment options that are more effective while having potentially reduced side effects than
currently existing treatments.

Drugs, cells and viruses
Table S1 lists IFNs and other antiviral agents, their suppliers and catalogue numbers. Lyophilized
IFNs were dissolved in sterile deionized water to obtain 200 µg/mL concentrations. To obtain 10 mM
stock solutions, compounds were dissolved in dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO; Sigma-Aldrich, Hamburg,
Germany) or milli-Q water. The convalescent serum (G614) obtained from a recovered COVID-19 patient
has been described in a previous study [22].
The propagation of human non-small cell lung cancer Calu-3, human adenocarcinoma alveolar basal
epithelial A549, African green monkey kidney Vero-E6, T-cell like ACH-2 cells, which possess a single
integrated copy of the provirus HIV-1 strain LAI (NIH AIDS Reagent Program), and human cervical
cancer derived TZM-bl, which express firefly luciferase under control of HIV-1 long terminal repeat
(LTR) promoter allowing quantitation of the viral infection (tat-protein expression by integrated HIV-1
provirus) using firefly luciferase assay, have been described in our previous studies [22, 40-43].
The propagation of wild-type SARS-CoV-2 (hCoV-19/Norway/Trondheim-S15/2020), recombinant
mCherry-expressing SARS-CoV-2 strains (SARS-CoV-2-mCherry), wild type human influenza
A/Udorn/307/1972 (H3N2) and HIV-1 have been also described previously [22, 40-43](Rihn et al.,
PBIOLOGY-D-20-02646R2). To quantitate the production of infectious virions, we titered the viruses
using plaque assays or ELISA [22, 40-43].

Drug Testing and Drug Sensitivity Quantification
Approximately 4 × 104 Vero-E6 or Calu-3 cells were seeded per well in 96-well plates. The cells were
grown for 24 h in DMEM or DMEM-F12, respectively, supplemented with 10% FBS and Pen–Strep. The
medium was then replaced with DMEM or DMEM-F12 containing 0.2% BSA, Pen–Strep and the
compounds in 3-fold dilutions at 7 different concentrations. No compounds were added to the control
wells. The cells were uninfected (mock) or infected with SARS-CoV-2 or SARS-CoV-2-mCherry strains at
a multiplicity of infection (moi) of 0.01. After 72 h of infection, a CellTiter-Glo (CTG) assay was performed
to measure cell viability. Drug efficacy on SARS-CoV-2-mCherry infected cells was measured on PFA- or
acetone-fixed cells with fluorescence.
For testing compound toxicity and efficacy against FluAV, approximately 4 × 104 A549 cells were
seeded in each well of a 96-well plate. The cells were grown for 24 h in growth medium in DMEM
supplemented with 10% FBS and Pen–Strep. The medium was then replaced with DMEM containing
0.2% BSA, Pen–Strep, 0,5 µg/mL TPSK-trypsin and compounds in three-fold dilutions at seven different
concentrations. No compounds were added to the control wells. The cells were infected with FluAV (moi

viability.
For testing compound toxicity and efficacy against HIV-1, approximately 4 × 104 TZM-bl cells were
seeded in each well of a 96-well plate in growth medium in DMEM supplemented with 10% FBS and
Pen–Strep. The cells were grown for 24 h in growth medium. The medium was then replaced with
DMEM containing 0.2% BSA, Pen–Strep and the compounds in 3-fold dilutions at 7 different
concentrations. No compounds were added to the control wells. The cells were infected with HIV-1
(corresponding to 300 ng/mL of HIV-1 p24) or mock. At 48 hours post-infection (hpi), the media was
removed from the cells, the cells were lysed, and firefly luciferase activity was measured using the
Luciferase Assay System (Promega, Madison, WI, USA). In a parallel experiment, a CTG assay was
performed to measure cell viability.
The half-maximal cytotoxic concentration (CC50) for each compound was calculated based on
viability/death curves obtained on mock-infected cells after non-linear regression analysis with a variable
slope using GraphPad Prism software version 7.0a. The half-maximal effective concentrations (EC50) were
calculated based on the analysis of the viability of infected cells by fitting drug dose-response curves
using four-parameter (4PL) logistic function f(x):

Drug Combination Test and Synergy Calculations
Calu-3, A549 or TZM-bl cells were treated with different concentrations of two drugs and infected
with SARS-CoV-2-mCherry (moi = 0.01), FluAV (moi = 0.5), HIV-1 (corresponding to 300 ng/mL of HIV-1

p24) or mock. After 48 h, cell viability and reporter protein expression (SARS-CoV-2-mCherry and HIV-1)
were measured. To test whether the drug combinations act synergistically, the observed responses were
compared with expected combination responses. The expected responses were calculated based on the
ZIP reference model using SynergyFinder version 2 [49, 50]. Final synergy scores were quantified as
average excess response due to drug interactions (i.e., 10% of cell survival beyond the expected additivity
between single drugs represents a synergy score of 10). Additionally, for each drug combination, we
report a most synergistic area score – the most synergistic 3-by-3 dose-window in a dose-response matrix.

Gene Expression Analysis
Calu-3 cells were treated with 1 µg/ml IFNa2a or vehicle control. Cells were infected with SARSCoV-2-mCherry at a moi of 0.01 or mock. After 24 h, total RNA was isolated using RNeasy Plus Mini kit
(Qiagen, Hilden, Germany). Polyadenylated mRNA was isolated from 250 ng of total RNA with
NEBNext Poly(A) mRNA magnetic isolation module. NEBNext Ultra II Directional RNA Library Prep kit
from Illumina was used to prepare samples for sequencing. Sequencing was done on NextSeq 500
instrument (set up: single-end 1 x 76 bp + dual index 8 bp) using NextSeq High Output 75 cycle
sequencing kit (up to 400M reads per flow cell). Reads were aligned using the Bowtie 2 software package
version 2.4.2 to the NCBI reference sequence for SARS-CoV-2 (NC_045512.2) and to the human GRCh38
genome.

The number of mapped and unmapped reads that aligned to each gene were obtained with the

featureCounts function from Rsubread R-package version 2.10. The GTF table for the reference sequence

Metabolic Analysis
Calu-3 cells were treated with 1 µg/ml IFNa2a or vehicle control. Cells were infected with SARSCoV-2-mCherry at a moi 0.01 or mock. After 24 h, virus was inactivated with UVC radiation and trypsin
treatment as described previously [22].
Metabolites were extracted from 100 μl of cell culture medium with 400 µL of cold extraction solvent
(acetonitrile:methanol:water; 40:40:20). Subsequently, samples were sonicated for 3 cycle (60 s, power = 60
and frequency = 37), vortexed for 2 min and centrifuged at 4 °C, 14000 rpm for 10 min. The supernatant
was transferred to autosampler vials for LC-MS analysis. The extracts were analyzed with Thermo

Vanquish UHPLC+ system coupled to a QExactive Orbitrap quadrupole mass spectrometer equipped
with a heated electrospray ionization (H-ESI) source probe (Thermo Fischer Scientific, Waltham, MA,
USA). A SeQuant ZIC-pHILIC (2.1 × 100 mm, 5 µm particles) HILIC phase analytical column (Merck
KGaA, Darmstadt, Germany) was used as a chromatographic separation column.
Gradient elution was carried out with a flow rate of 0.100 mL/min with 20 mM ammonium
carbonate, adjusted to pH 9.4 with ammonium solution (25%) as mobile phase A and acetonitrile as
mobile phase B. The gradient elution was initiated from 20% mobile phase A and 80% mobile phase B
and maintained for 2 min. Then, mobile phase A was gradually increased up to 80% for 17 min, followed
by a decrease to 20% over the course of 17.1 min. and sustained for up to 24 min.
The column oven and auto-sampler temperatures were set to 40 ± 3 °C and 5 ± 3 °C, respectively. The
mass spectrometer was equipped with a heated electrospray ionization (H-ESI) source using polarity
switching and the following settings: resolution of 35,000, the spray voltages of 4250 V for positive and
3250 V for negative mode, sheath gas at 25 arbitrary units (AU), the auxiliary gas at 15 AU, sweep gas
flow of 0, Capillary temperature of 275°C, and S-lens RF level of 50.0. Instrument control was operated
with Xcalibur 4.1.31.9 software (Thermo Fischer Scientific, Waltham, MA, USA). Metabolite peaks were
confirmed using the mass spectrometry metabolite library kit MSMLS-1EA (Sigma Aldrich supplied by
IROA Technologies).
For data processing, final peak integration was done with the TraceFinder 4.1 software (Thermo
Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA, USA) and for further data analysis, the peak area data was exported as
an Excel file. Data quality was monitored throughout the run using pooled healthy human serum as
Quality Control (QC), which was processed and extracted in the same manner as unknown samples.
After integration of QC data with TraceFinder 4.1, each detected metabolite was checked and %RSD were
calculated, while the acceptance limit was set to ≤ 20%.
Blank samples were injected after every five runs to monitor any metabolite carryover. A carryover
limit of ≤ 20% was set for each metabolite. Percentage background noise was calculated by injecting a
blank sample at the beginning of the run. The acceptance limit for background noise was set at ≤ 20% for
each metabolite.
