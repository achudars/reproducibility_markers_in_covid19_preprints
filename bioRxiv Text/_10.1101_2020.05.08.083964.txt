Abstract
20

The pandemic of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) caused by severe acute respiratory
syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) presents a global public health threat. Most
research on therapeutics against SARS-CoV-2 focused on the receptor binding domain
(RBD) of the Spike (S) protein, whereas the vulnerable epitopes and functional mechanism
of non-RBD regions are poorly understood. Here we isolated and characterized monoclonal

25

antibodies (mAbs) derived from convalescent COVID-19 patients. An mAb targeting the Nterminal domain (NTD) of the SARS-CoV-2 S protein, named 4A8, exhibits high
neutralization potency against both authentic and pseudotyped SARS-CoV-2, although it
does not block the interaction between angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) receptor
and S protein. The cryo-EM structure of the SARS-CoV-2 S protein in complex with 4A8

30

has been determined to an overall resolution of 3.1 Angstrom and local resolution of 3.4
Angstrom for the 4A8-NTD interface, revealing detailed interactions between the NTD and
4A8. Our functional and structural characterizations discover a new vulnerable epitope of
the S protein and identify promising neutralizing mAbs as potential clinical therapy for
COVID-19.

The global outbreak of COVID-19 has emerged as a severe threat to human health (1-4) ,
claiming over two hundred and sixty thousand lives as 7 May, 2020 (5). COVID-19 is caused by
a novel coronavirus, the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), which
40

is an enveloped, positive-strand RNA virus that causes upper respiratory diseases, fever and
severe pneumonia in humans (2, 3, 6).

SARS-CoV-2 is a new member of the β coronavirus genus, which also contains SARS-CoV and
MERS-CoV that caused epidemic in 2002 and 2012, respectively (7, 8). SARS-CoV-2 shares
45

about 80% sequence identity to SARS-CoV, implying similar infection mechanism (2). Indeed,
SARS-CoV-2, same as SARS-CoV, hijacks angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) as cellular
receptor (9-19).

The trimeric S protein covers the surface of coronavirus and plays a pivotal role during viral
50

entry (20, 21). The S protein is cleaved into the N-terminal S1 subunit and C-terminal S2 subunit
by host proteases such as TMPRSS2 (21, 22) and undergoes conformational change from
prefusion to postfusion state during infection (23). S1 and S2 mediate receptor binding and
membrane fusion, respectively (18). S1, consisting of the N-terminal domain (NTD) and the
receptor binding domain (RBD), is critical in determining tissue tropism and host ranges (24,

55

25). The RBD is responsible for binding to ACE2, while the function of NTD is not well
understood. In some coronaviruses, the NTD may recognize specific sugar moieties upon initial
attachment and might play an important role in the prefusion to postfusion transition of the S
protein (26-29). The NTD of the MERS-CoV S protein can serve as a critical epitope for
antibody neutralizing (29).

The SARS-CoV-2 S protein-targeting monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) with potent neutralizing
activity have become the focus of therapeutic interventions for COVID-19 (30-32). Most SARSCoV-2 antibodies reported previously were sorted to target the RBD in order to inhibit the
association between the S protein and ACE2 (31-34). The RBD-targeting antibodies, when
65

applied individually, may induce viral escaping mutations, thus fostering evolution of new viral
strains that are insensitive to these antibodies (29). Antibodies targeting non-RBD regions may
serve as “cocktail” therapeutics for SARS-CoV-2.

Here we report the isolation and characterization of S protein-specific monoclonal antibodies
70

derived from memory B or plasma B cells of COVID-19 survivors. We also determined the
structure of the complex between the SARS-CoV-2 S protein and 4A8, one of the isolated mAbs,
at an overall resolution of 3.1 Å and local resolution of 3.4 Å for the interfaces between 4A8 and
the S protein. 4A8 targets the S-NTD with potent neutralizing activity. These findings reveal a
new epitope of the SARS-CoV-2 S protein for antibody neutralizing, which may lay the

75

foundation for new prophylactic and therapeutic interventions for SARS-CoV-2.

Results
Isolation of human mAbs from memory B cells and plasma B cells
To isolate monoclonal antibodies and analyze the humoral antibody responses to SARS-CoV-2,
80

we collected plasma and peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) from 10 patients
recovered from SARS-CoV-2 infection. The age of donors ranges from 25 to 53 years. The
interval from blood collection date to disease confirmation date ranged from 23 to 29 days for

No. 1-5 patients and 10 to 15 days for No. 6-10 patients (Table S1). We evaluated the titers of
binding antibodies in plasma to different fragments of the SARS-CoV-2 S protein, including the
85

extracellular domain (S-ECD), S1, S2, and RBD, and the Nucleocapsid (N) Protein. Plasma from
all the patients except donor No. 2 bound to all 5 SARS-CoV-2 protein segments, while that
from donor No. 2 recognized S-ECD and S2 only (Fig. 1A). The neutralizing capacities of
plasma against live SARS-CoV-2 and HIV-vectored pseudotyped SARS-CoV-2 are correlated
(r=0.6868, p<0.05) (Fig. 1B). These results indicate that humoral immune responses were

90

specifically elicited for all of the 10 patients during the natural infection of SARS-CoV-2.

To isolate S protein-specific monoclonal antibodies, we first sorted the IgG+ memory B cells
from peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) of the No. 1-5 convalescent patients with
flow cytometry using S-ECD as probe (Fig. 1C). The percentage of S-ECD-reactive IgG+ B cells
95

ranges from 0.56% to 11% as revealed by fluorescence activating cell sorter (FACS). To avoid
bias introduced by S-ECD, we sorted plasma B cells from mixed PBMCs derived from another
five convalescent patients (No. 6-10) without any antigen-specific probes. The percentage of
plasma B cells in CD3-CD19+ B cells was 12.8%, higher than that of memory B cells (Fig. 1C).

100

From the sorted B cells, we identified 9, 286, 43, 12 and 26 clones of single B cell from patients
No. 1 to 5, respectively, and 23 clones of single B cell from the mixed PBMCs of patients No. 6
to 10 (Fig. 1D). The distribution of the sequenced heavy (IgH) gene families was comparable
among the 10 donors, with VH3 being the most commonly used VH gene, while different donors
displayed variable preferences for the light chain (IgL) gene families (Fig. 1D). The combination

105

of V3 and J4, V3 and D3, and D3 and J4 were the most common usage for the IgH gene family

(Fig. S1). The plasma B cells have less mutations than memory B cells in both heavy variable
chains (VH) and light variable chains (VL) (Fig. 1E), suggesting lower levels of somatic
hypermutation (SHM) in plasma B cells than memory B cells after SARS-CoV-2 infection. The
lengths of complementarity-determining region (CDR) 3 for antibodies were similar among the

110

donors, ranging from 13.9 to 17.7 for VH and 9.3 to 10.1 for VL (Fig. 1F).

Binding profiles of SARS-CoV-2 S protein-specific human mAbs
To screen S protein-specific antibodies, we determined the binding specificity using ELISA for
the 399 human mAbs sorted above. 1, 16, 1, 3, and 9 S-ECD-specific mAbs were identified from
115

donors No. 1-5, respectively. A total of 5 mAbs were identified from donors No. 6 -10 (Fig. 2A).
The sequence identities of CDRH3 in the 35 S-ECD-specific mAb ranged from 40.9% to 97.6%
(Fig. S2 and Table S2). We further characterized domain specificities of the 35 mAbs with
different fragments of the S protein, including S1, S2 and RBD (Fig. 2A). The S-reactive mAbs
are classified into 4 major groups based on their EC50 values (Fig. 2A). Group 1 recognizes only

120

S-ECD. Group 2 recognizes S-ECD and S1, with subgroup 2A binding S-ECD and S1 and

subgroup 2B binding S-ECD, S1, and RBD. Group 3 interacts with both S1 and S2, with

subgroup 3A targeting RBD and subgroup 3B fails to bind RBD. Group 4 recognizes S-ECD and
S2. Remarkably, only 4 mAbs recognize RBD among the 35 S-specific mAbs (Figure 2A and
2B).

A competition-binding assay using ELISA were performed for several representative mAbs to
determine if there are any overlapping antigenic sites within distinct binding groups or between
different mAbs, with CR3022 being used as a control that cross-reacts with the RBD of both
SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 (35) (Fig. 2C). Among these mAbs, 4A8 competed with 1D2.
130

Another RBD-reactive mAb, 2M-10B11, competed with CR3022, suggesting overlapped
epitopes on RBD for these two mAbs. These results indicate that the S-specific antibodies
elicited by SARS-CoV-2 infection target at least four antigenic regions on the S protein of
SARS-CoV-2.

135

To characterize the diversity in gene usage and affinity maturation, the phylogenetic trees of
these S-specific mAbs were analyzed based on the amino acid sequences of VHDJH and VLJL
using a neighbor-joining method in MEGA7 Software. Results indicate that the VH gene usage
is very diverse among the 35 mAbs from 10 donors, with VH 3-30 being the most frequently
used germline gene. Moreover, there was no particularly favored VH gene identified among S1,

140

S2, or RBD-reactive mAbs (Fig. 2D).

Neutralizing activities of SARS-CoV-2 S-specific human mAbs
We first performed in vitro neutralization studies of the 35 S-specific mAbs using live SARSCoV-2 virus in Vero-E6 cells (Fig. 3A). 1M-1D2 and 4A8 exhibited medium to high neutralizing
145

capacity with EC50 of 23.99 and 0.607 µg/ml, respectively, while the neutralizing curves of
0304-3H3 cannot be fit well. As expected, the RBD-targeting control mAb, CR3022, failed to
neutralize live SARS-CoV-2 (35). Moreover, while the CR3022-competing mAb, 10B11, bound

to the SARS-CoV-2 RBD with EC50 of 5 ng/ml, it also failed to neutralize live SARS-CoV-2.
These results suggest that binding affinities of mAbs against RBD did not correlate fully with the
150

neutralizing abilities of mAbs. To further investigate the inhibitory activity of 4A8, 0304-3H3,
and 1M-1D2 to live virus, we tested the RNA load of live viruses in Vero-E6 cells treated with
each mAb using real time qPCR (Fig. 3B). Consistent with the cytopathic effect (CPE) assay
results (Fig. 3A), 4A8 displayed higher inhibitory capacities than 1M-1D2.

155

We next performed luciferase reporter gene assays for all 35 S-binding mAbs using HIVvectored pseudotyped SARS-CoV-2, among which 3 mAbs exhibited neutralizing activity
against the pseudotyped virus (Fig. 3C). 4A8 protected ACE2-293T cells with EC50 of 52.03
µg/ml, while neutralization of 0304-3H3 and 1M-1D2 were not observed. 10B11 and 9A1
showed a minor level of inhibition. These findings suggest that the results of pseudotyped

160

SARS-CoV-2 were not entirely consistent with that of live SARS-CoV-2. This difference is
likely explained by the insusceptibility of pseudotyped SARS-CoV-2 to some mAbs with
specific neutralizing mechanisms. 4A8 is likely to be a potential candidate for the treatment of
SARS-CoV-2, since 4A8 displayed high levels neutralizing capacities against both authentic and
pseudotyped SARS-CoV-2.

165

Binding characterization of candidate mAbs
To determine the possible neutralizing mechanism of the mAbs, we first determined the binding
affinities of mAbs to different segments of the S protein, including S-ECD, S1, S2, and RBD
using bio-layer interferometry. All 5 tested mAbs bound to S-ECD with high affinity, with the

170

equilibrium dissociation constant (KD) less than 2.14 nM (Fig. 4A). 4A8, 1M-1D2, and 10B11
bound to S1 with similar KD ranging from 92.7 to 159 nM, whereas 0304-3H3 and 9A1 targeted
S2. Additionally, 10B11 were shown to bind RBD with KD of 26.8 nM.

To further investigate whether these mAbs block the binding of S protein to ACE2, we
175

performed flow cytometry using HEK 293T cells expressing human ACE2. As expected, only
10B11 among the 5 mAbs prevented S protein from binding to ACE2, with percentage of 0.52%
for IgG and S protein double-positive cell (Fig 4B). However, CR3022, which competes with
10B11, did not interfere with the binding of S to ACE2 with double positive cell percentage of
31.7%. 4A8 also failed to interfere with binding of the S protein to ACE2.

180

Cryo-EM structure of the complex between 4A8 and S-ECD
The mAb 4A8 was overexpressed and purified by Protein A resin from the B memory cells and
S-ECD of SARS-CoV-2 was purified through M2 affinity resin and size exclusion
chromatography. 4A8 and S-ECD protein were mixed and incubated at a stoichiometric ratio of
185

~ 1.2 to 1 for 1 hour and applied to size exclusion chromatography to remove excess proteins.
The fraction containing the complex was concentrated for cryo-EM sample preparation.

To investigate the interactions between 4A8 and the S protein, we solved the cryo-EM structure
of the complex at an overall resolution of 3.1 Å (Fig. 5, Movie S1). Details of cryo-EM sample
190

preparation, data collection and processing, and model building can be found in Materials and
Methods and supplementary materials (Figs. S3-S5). The S protein exhibits asymmetric

conformations similar to the previously reported structures (24, 25), with one RBD “up” and the
other two “down” (Fig. 5, fig. S3I).

195

Recognition of the NTD by 4A8
Three 4A8 molecules bind to one trimeric S protein, each interacting with one NTD domain.
Despite the different conformations of the three S protein protomers, the interface between 4A8
and each NTD is identical (Fig. 5). The map quality at the NTD-4A8 region was improved by
focused refinement with a local resolution of 3.4 Å, enabling reliable analysis of the interactions

200

between the NTD and the 4A8.

Association with 4A8 appears to stabilize the NTD epitope, which is invisible in the reported S
protein structure alone (24, 25). Supported by the high resolution of NTD, we were able to build
the structural model for three new loops for NTD, designated N1 (residues 67-79), N2 (residues
205

141-156), and N3 (residues 246-260), among which N2 and N3 loops mediate the interaction
with 4A8.

Only the heavy chain of 4A8 participates in binding to the NTD mainly through three loops,
named L1, L2 and L3 (Fig. 6A). The interface is constituted by extensive hydrophilic interaction
210

network. R246 on the N3 loop of the NTD represents one docking site, simultaneously
interacting with Glu1, Tyr27 and Glu31 of 4A8 (Fig. 6B). On the N2 loop of the NTD, Lys150
and Lys147 respectively form salt bridge with Glu54 and Glu72 of 4A8 (Fig. 6C). Lys150 is also
hydrogen bonded (H-bond) with 4A8-Tyr111, while His146 forms a H-bond with 4A8-Thr30
(Fig. 6C). In addition to the hydrophilic interactions, Trp152 and Tyr145 on the N2 loop of the

215

NTD also interact with Val102, Pro106, and Phe109 on the L3 loop of the mAb through
hydrophobic and/or π-π interactions (Fig. 6D).

Discussion
There is an urgent need for prophylactic and therapeutic interventions for SARS-CoV-2
220

infections given the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic. No fully human neutralizing Abs have been
reported, and little is known about the structural determinants of neutralization on which to base
the rational selection of antibodies. Our work reveals that naturally occurring human SARSCoV-2 mAbs isolated from the B cells of 10 recovered donors are diverse in gene usage and
epitope recognition of S protein. Remarkably, the majority of the isolated mAbs did not

225

recognize the RBD, and all the mAbs that neutralize live SARS-CoV-2 failed to inhibit the
binding of S protein to ACE2. These unexpected results suggest the presence of other important
mechanisms for SARS-CoV-2 neutralization in addition to suppressing the viral interaction with
the receptor.

230

The S1-targeting mAb 4A8 does not block the interaction between ACE2 and S protein, but
exhibits high levels of neutralization against both authentic and pseudotyped SARS-CoV-2 in
vitro. Many neutralizing antibodies against the SARS-CoV-2 were reported to target the RBD of
the S protein and block the binding between RBD and ACE2. Our results show that 4A8 bind to
the NTD of S protein with potent neutralizing activity. Previous study showed that mAb 7D10

235

could bind to the NTD of S protein of MERS-CoV probably by inhibiting the RBD-ACE2
binding and the prefusion to postfusion conformational change of S protein (29). We aligned the
crystal structure of 7D10 in complex with the NTD of S protein of MERS-CoV with our
11

complex structure and found that the interfaces between the mAb and the NTDs are partially
overlapped (Fig. S6). 7D10 may inhibit the interaction between MERS-CoV and ACE2 through
240

its light chain that is close to the RBD. In our complex, the light chain of 4A8 is away from the
RBD (Fig. S6). Therefore, we speculate that 4A8 may neutralize SARS-CoV-2 by restraining the
conformational changes of the S protein. Furthermore, sequences alignment of the S proteins
from SARS-CoV-2, SARS-CoV, and MERS-CoV revealed varied NTD surface sequences that
are respectively recognized by different mAbs (Fig. S7).

245

Overall, this work reports a fully human neutralizing mAb recognizing a vulnerable epitope of
NTD on S protein of SARS-CoV-2, functioning with a mechanism that is independent of
receptor binding inhibition. Combination of 4A8 with RBD-targeting antibodies may avoid the
escaping mutations of virus and serve as promising “cocktail” therapeutics. The information
250

obtained from these studies can be used for development of the structure-based vaccine design
against SARS-CoV-2.

Fig. 1. Isolation of antigen-specific monoclonal antibodies from convalescent patients of
SARS-CoV-2. (A) Reactions of plasma to SARS-CoV-2 proteins. S-ECD (extracellular domain
of S protein), S1, S2, RBD (receptor binding domain) and N (nucleotide protein) were used in
ELISA to test the binding of plasma. Plasma of heathy donors were used as control, and cut-off
values were calculated as O.D. 450 of control x 2.1. (B) The correlations between the authentic

binding of some representative S-reactive mAbs assayed in ELISA. Numbers in the box indicate
the percentage binding of detecting mAb in the presence of the blocking antibody compared to
the binding of detecting mAb in the absence of the blocking antibody. The mAbs were
considered competing if the inhibiting percentage is <30% (black boxes with white numbers).
The mAbs were judged to non-compete for the same site if the percentage is >70% (white boxes

ACE2 overexpressing 293T cells were determined by flow cytometry. Following the
preincubation of S protein with each indicated mAb, the mAb-S mixtures were added to the
ACE2-expressing cells. cells were stained with anti-human IgG FITC (mAb binding, x-axis) and
anti-His (S binding, y-axis). Percentages of double positive cells were shown. Control mAb
CR3022 and 1A8 were previously reported to bind SARS-CoV RBD and Marburg glycoprotein,
