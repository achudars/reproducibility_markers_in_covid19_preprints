Abstract
Background: New endemic disease has been spread across Wuhan City, China on December
2019. Within few weeks, the World Health Organization (WHO) announced a novel coronavirus
designated as coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). In late January 2020, WHO declared the
outbreak of a “public-health emergency of international concern” due to the rapid and increasing
spread of the disease worldwide. Currently, there is no vaccine or approved treatment for this
emerging infection; thus the objective of this study is to design a multi epitope peptide vaccine
against COVID-19 using immunoinformatics approach.
Method: Several techniques facilitating the combination of immunoinformatics approach and
comparative genomic approach were used in order to determine the potential peptides for
designing the T cell epitopes-based peptide vaccine using the envelope protein of 2019-nCoV as
a target.
Results: Extensive mutations, insertion and deletion were discovered with comparative
sequencing in COVID-19 strain. Additionally, ten peptides binding to MHC class I and MHC
class II were found to be promising candidates for vaccine design with adequate world
population coverage of 88.5% and 99.99%, respectively.
Conclusion: T cell epitopes-based peptide vaccine was designed for COVID-19 using envelope
protein as an immunogenic target. Nevertheless, the proposed vaccine is rapidly needed to be
validated clinically in order to ensure its safety, immunogenic profile and to help on stopping this
epidemic before it leads to devastating global outbreaks.
Keywords: Novel coronavirus (COVID-19), Envelope protein, Emerging infection, Epitopebased vaccine, Immunoinformatics approach.

1. Introduction:
Coronaviruses (CoV) are a large family of zoonotic viruses that cause illness ranging from the
common cold to more severe diseases such as Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS-CoV)
and severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS-CoV). In the last decades, six strains of
coronaviruses were identified, however in December 2019; a new strain has been spread across
Wuhan City, China [1, 2]. It was designated as coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) by the
World Health Organization (WHO) [3]. In late January 2020, WHO declared the outbreak a
global pandemic with cases in more than 45 countries where the COVID-19 spreading fast
outside China, most significantly in South Korea, Italy and Iran with over 2,924 deaths and
85,212 cases confirmed while 39,537 recovered at 29 February 2020, 06:05 AM (GMT).
COVID-19 is a positive-sense single stranded RNA virus (+ssRNA). Its RNA sequence is
approximately 30,000 bases in length [4]. It belongs to the subgenus Sarbecovirus, Genus
Betacoronavirus within the family Coronaviridae. The corona envelope (E) protein is a small,
integral membrane protein involved in several aspects of the virus’ life cycle, such as
pathogenesis, envelope formation, assembly and budding; alongside with its interactions with
both other CoVs proteins (M, N & S) and host cell proteins (release of infectious particles after
budding) [5-9].
The infected person characterized with fever, upper or lower respiratory tract symptoms, or
diarrhoea, lymphopenia, thrombocytopenia, and increased C-reactive protein and lactate
dehydrogenase levels or combination of all these within 3-6 days after exposure. Further
molecular diagnosis can be made by Real Time-PCR for genes encoding the internal RNAdependent RNA polymerase and Spike's receptor binding domain, which can be confirmed by
Sanger sequencing and full genome analysis by NGS, multiplex nucleic acid amplification and
microarray-based assays [10-14]
A phylogenetic tree of the mutation history of a family of viruses is possible to reconstruct with a
sufficient number of sequenced genomes. The phylogenetic analysis indicates that COVID-19 is
likely originated from bats [15]. It also showed that is highly related with at most seven
mutations relative to a common ancestor [16].
The sequence of COVID-19 RBD, together with its RBM that contacts receptor angiotensinconverting enzyme 2 (ACE2), was found similar to that of SARS coronavirus. On January 2020,
a group of scientists demonstrated that ACE2 could act as the receptor for COVID-19 [17-21].

However, COVID-19 differs from other previous strains in having several critical residues at
2019-nCoV receptor-binding motif (particularly Gln493) which provide advantageous
interactions with human ACE2 [15]. This difference in affinity possibly explains why the novel
coronavirus is more contagious than those other viruses.
At present, there is no vaccine or approved treatment for humans, but Chinese traditional
medicine, such ShuFengJieDu Capsules and Lianhuaqingwen Capsule, could be possible
treatments for COVID-19. However, there are no clinical trials approving the safety and efficacy
for these drugs [22].
The main concept within all the immunizations is the ability of the vaccine to initiate an immune
response in a faster mode than the pathogen itself. Although traditional vaccines, which depend
on biochemical trials, induced potent neutralizing and protective responses in the immunized
animals but they can be costly, allergenic, time consuming and require in vitro culture of
pathogenic viruses leading to serious concern of safety [23, 24]. Thus the need for safe and
efficacious vaccines is highly recommended.
Peptide-based vaccines do not need in vitro culture making them biologically safe, and their
selectivity allows accurate activation of immune responses [25, 26]. The core mechanism of the
peptide vaccines is built on the chemical method to synthesize the recognized B-cell and T-cell
epitopes that are immunodominant and can induce specific immune responses. B-cell epitope of
a target molecule can be linked with a T-cell epitope to make it immunogenic. The T-cell
epitopes are short peptide fragments (8-20 amino acids), whereas the B-cell epitopes can be
proteins [27, 28]. Therefore, in this study, we aimed to design a peptide-based vaccine to predict
epitopes from corona envelope (E) protein using immunoinformatics analysis [29-34]. While
rapid further studies are recommended to prove the efficiency of the predicted epitopes as a
peptide vaccine against this emerging infection.

2.2. The Artemis Comparison Tool (ACT):
ACT is an in silico analysis software for visualization of comparisons between complete genome
sequences and associated annotations [35]. It is also applied to identify regions of similarity,
rearrangements and insertions at any level from base-pair differences to the whole genome.
(https://www.sanger.ac.uk/science/tools/artemis-comparison-tool-act).
2.3. VaxiJen server:
It is the first server for alignment-independent prediction of protective antigens. It allows antigen
classification solely based on the physicochemical properties of proteins without recourse to
sequence alignment. It predicts the probability of the antigenicity one or multiple of protein
based on auto cross covariance (ACC) transformation of protein sequence. Structural CoV-2019
protein (N,S,E and M) was analyzed by VaxiJen with threshold of 0.4 [36]. (http://www.ddgpharmfac.net/vaxijen/VaxiJen/VaxiJen.html)
2.4. BioEdit:
It is a software package proposed to stream a distinct program that can run nearly any sequence
operation as well as a few basic alignment investigations. The sequences of E protein were
retrieved from UniProt were run in BioEdit to determine the conserved sites through ClustalW in
the application settings [37].
2.5. The Molecular Evolutionary Genetics Analysis (MEGA):
MEGA (version 10.1.6) is software for the comparative analysis of molecular sequences. It is
used for pairwise and multiple sequences alignment alongside construction and analysis of
phylogenetic trees and evolutionary relationships. The gap penalty was 15 for opening and 6.66
for extending the gap for both pairwise and multiple sequences alignment. Bootstrapping of 300
was used in construction of maximum like hood phylogenetic tree [38, 39].
(https://www.megasoftware.net).
2.6. Prediction of T-cell epitopes:
IEDB tools were used to predict the conserved sequences (10-mersequence) from HLA class I
and class II T-cell epitopes by using artificial neural network (ANN) approach [40-42]. Artificial
Neural Network (ANN) version 2.2 was chosen as Prediction method as it depends on the
median inhibitory concentration (IC50) [40, 43-45]. For the binding analysis, all the alleles were
carefully chosen, and the length was set at 10 before prediction was done. Analysis of epitopes
binding to MHC class I and II molecules was assessed by the IEDB MHC prediction server at
(http://tools.iedb.org/mhci/) and (http://tools.iedb.org/mhcii/), respectively. All conserved
immunodominant peptides binding to MHC I and II molecules at score equal or less than 100
median inhibitory concentrations (IC50) and 1000, respectively were selected for further analysis
while epitopes with IC50 greater than 100 were eliminated [46].

2.7. Population coverage analysis:
Population coverage for each epitope was carefully determined by the IEDB population coverage
calculation tool. Due to the diverse binding sites of epitopes with different HLA allele, the most
promising epitope candidates were calculated for population coverage against the whole world,
China and Europe population to get and ensure a universal vaccine [47, 48].
(http://tools.iedb.org/population/)
2.8. Tertiary structure (3D) Modeling:
The reference sequence of E protein that has been retrieved from gene bank was used as an input
in RaptorX to predict the 3D structure of E protein [49, 50], the visualization of the obtained 3D
protein structure was performed in UCSF Chimera (version1.8) [51].
2.9. In silico Molecular Docking:
2.9.1. Ligand Preparation:
In order to estimate the binding affinities between the epitopes and molecular structure of MHC I
and MHC II, in silico molecular docking were used. Sequences of proposed epitopes were
selected from COVID-19 reference sequence using UCSF Chimera 1.10 and saved as a PDB file.
The obtained files were then optimized and energy minimized. The HLA-A*02:01 was selected
as the macromolecule for docking. Its crystal structure (4UQ3) was downloaded from the RCSB
Protein Data Bank (http://www.rcsb.org/pdb/home/home.do), which was in a complex with an
azobenzene-containing peptide [52].
All water molecules and heteroatoms in the retrieved target file 4UQ3 were then removed.
Target structure was further optimized and energy minimized using Swiss PDB viewer V.4.1.0
software[53].
2.9.2. Molecular docking
Molecular docking was performed using Autodock 4.0 software, based on Lamarckian Genetic
Algorithm; which combines energy evaluation through grids of affinity potential to find the
suitable binding position for a ligand on a given protein[54,55]Polar hydrogen atoms were added
to the protein targets and Kollman united atomic charges were computed. The target's grid map
was calculated and set to 60×60×60 points with grid spacing of 0.375 Ǻ. The grid box was then
allocated properly in the target to include the active residue in the center. The genetic algorithm
and its run were set to 100.The docking algorithms were set to default. Finally, results were

4. Discussion:
Designing of a novel vaccine is very crucial to defending the rapid endless of global burden of
disease [56-59]. In the last few decades, biotechnology has advanced rapidly; alongside with the
understanding of immunology which assisted the rise of new approaches towards
rational vaccines design [60]. Peptide-based vaccines are designed to elicit immunity particular
pathogens by selectively stimulating antigen specific for B and T cells [61].Applying the
advanced bioinformatics tools and databases, various peptide-based vaccines could be designed
where the peptides act as ligands [62-64]. This approach has been used frequently in Saint Louis
encephalitis virus [65], dengue virus [66], chikungunya virus [67] proposing promising peptides
for designing vaccines.
The COVID-19 is an RNA virus which tends to mutate more commonly than the DNA viruses
[68]. These mutations lied on the surface of the protein, which make COVID-19 more superior
than other previous strains by inducing its sustainability leaving the immune system in blind spot
[69].
In our present work, different peptides were proposed for the designing of vaccine against
COVID-19 (Fig. 1). In the beginning, the whole genome of COVID-19 was analyzed by
comparative genomic approach to determine the potential antigenic target [70]. Artemis
Comparative Tool (ACT) was used to analyze human Coronavirus (HCov-HKU1) reference
sequence vs. Wuhan-Hu-1 COVID-19. Results obtained (Fig.2) revealed extensive mutation
among the tested genomes. New genes; ORF8 and ORF6; were found inserted in COVID-19
which were absent in HCov-HKU1 that might be acquired by the horizontal gene transmission
[71]. High rate of mutation between the two genomes were observed in the region from 20000 bp
to the end of the sequence. This region encodes the four major structural proteins in coronavirus
which are envelope (E) protein, nucleocapsid (N) protein, membrane (M) protein, and spike (S)
protein, all of which are required to produce a structurally complete virus [72, 73].
These conserved antigenic sites were revealed in previous studies through sequence alignment
between MERS-CoV and Bat-coronavirus [74] and analyzed in SARS-CoV [75].
The four proteins were then analyzed by Vaxigen software to test the probability of antigenic
proteins. Protein E was found to be the most antigenic gene with the highest probability as
shown in Table 1. Literature survey confirmed this result in which protein E was investigated in
severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) in 2003 and, more recently, Middle-East respiratory

syndrome (MERS) [72]. Furthermore, the conservation of this protein against the seven strains
was tested and confirmed through the use of BioEdit package tool (Fig. 3).
As phylogenetic analysis is very powerful tool for determining the evolutionary relationship
between strains. Multiple sequence alignment (MSA) was performed using ClustalW for the
seven strains of coronavirus, which are COVID-19(NC_04551), SARS-CoV (FJ211859),
MESA-CoV (NC_019843), HCoV-HKU1 (AY884001), HCoV-OC43 (KF923903), HCoVNL63 (NC_005831) and HCoV-229E (KY983587). The maximum likelihood phylogenetic tree
revealed that COVID-19 is found in the same clade of SARS-CoV, thus the two strains are
highly related to each other (Fig. 4).
The immune response of T cell is considered as a long lasting response compared to B cell,
where the antigen can easily escape the antibody memory response [76]. Vaccines that
effectively generate cell-mediated response are needed to provide protection against the invading
pathogen. Moreover the CD8+ T and CD4+ T cell responses play a major role in antiviral
immunity [77]. Thus designing vaccine against T cell is much more important.
Choosing protein E as the antigenic site, the binding affinity to MHC molecules was then
evaluated. The protein reference sequence was submitted to IEDB MHC predication tool. 21
peptides were found to bind MHC class I with different affinities (Table 1), from which ten
peptides were selected for vaccine design based on the number of alleles and world population
percentage (Table 2; Fig. 5).Analysis in IEDB MHC II binding prediction tool resulted in
prediction of 61 peptides (Table 2), from which ten peptides were selected for vaccine design
based on the number of alleles and world population percentage (Table 3; Fig.5). Unfortunately,
IEDB did not give any result for B cell epitopes, this might be due to the length of the COVID19 (75 amino acids).
It is well known that peptides recognized with high number of HLA molecules are potentially
inducing immune response. Based on the aforementioned results and taking into consideration
the high binding affinity to both MHC classes I and II, conservancy and population coverage,
three peptides are strongly proposed to formulate a new vaccine against COVID-19.
These findings were further confirmed by the results obtained for the molecular docking of the
proposed peptides and HLA-A*02:01. The formed complex between MHC molecule and the
three peptides (YVYSRVKNL, SLVKPSFYV and LAILTALRL) have shown peptide amino- and
carboxyl-termini forming one and three hydrogen bonds, respectively at the two ends of a binding

groove with MHC residues with least binding energy -13.2 kcal/mol, -11 kcal/mol and -11.3
kcal/mol, respectively (Fig.6C, D and E).
Although both flu and anti-HIV drugs are used currently in China for treatment of COVID-19,
and chloroquine phosphate, an old drug for treatment of malaria, has recently found to have
apparent efficacy and acceptable safety against COVID-19 [78,79]; nevertheless more studies
are required to standardize these therapies. In addition, there has been some success in the
development of mouse models of MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV infection, and candidate vaccines
where the envelope (E) protein is mutated or deleted have been described [80-86]. To best of our
knowledge, this is the first study to identify certain peptides in envelope (E) protein as candidates
for COVID-19. Accordingly, these epitopes were strongly recommended as promising epitopes
vaccine candidate against T cell.

5. Conclusion:
Extensive mutations, insertion and deletion were discovered in COVID-19 strain using the
comparative sequencing. In addition, a number of MHC class I and II related peptides were
found promising candidates. Among which the peptides YVYSRVKNL, SLVKPSFYV and
LAILTALRL show high potentiality for vaccine design with adequate world population
coverage. T cell epitope-based peptide vaccine was designed for COVID-19 using envelope
protein as an immunogenic target; nevertheless, the proposed vaccine rapidly needs to be
validated clinically ensuring its safety and immunogenic profile to help on stopping this
epidemic before it leads to devastating global outbreaks.
