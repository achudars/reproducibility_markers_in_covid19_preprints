Abstract
The SARS-CoV-2 nucleocapsid (N) protein is the most immunogenic of the structural
proteins and plays essential roles in several stages of the virus lifecycle. It is comprised of two
major structural domains: the RNA binding domain, which interacts with viral and host RNA, and
the oligomerization domain which assembles to form the viral core. Here, we investigate the
assembly state and RNA binding properties of the full-length nucleocapsid protein using native
mass spectrometry. We find that dimers, and not monomers, of full-length N protein bind RNA,
implying that dimers are the functional unit of ribonucleoprotein assembly. In addition, we find that
N protein binds RNA with a preference for GGG motifs which are known to form short stem loop
structures. Unexpectedly, we found that N undergoes proteolytic processing within the linker
region, separating the two major domains. This process results in the formation of at least five
proteoforms that we sequenced using electron transfer dissociation, higher-energy collision
induced dissociation and corroborated by peptide mapping. The cleavage sites identified are in
highly conserved regions leading us to consider the potential roles of the resulting proteoforms.
We found that monomers of N-terminal proteoforms bind RNA with the same preference for GGG
motifs and that the oligomeric state of a C-terminal proteoform (N156-419) is sensitive to pH. We
then tested interactions of the proteoforms with the immunophilin cyclophilin A, a key component
in coronavirus replication. We found that N1-209 and N1-273 bind directly to cyclophilin A, an
interaction that is abolished by the approved immunosuppressant drug cyclosporin A. In addition,
we found the C-terminal proteoform N156-419 generated the highest antibody response in
convalescent plasma from patients >6 months from initial COVID-19 diagnosis when compared
to the other proteoforms. Overall, the different interactions of N proteoforms with RNA, cyclophilin
A, and human antibodies have implications for viral proliferation and vaccine development.

Introduction
Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is the etiological agent
of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) which reached pandemic status in fewer than three
months following its discovery. As of October 2020, there are >34 million infected and more than
1 million deaths.1 However, SARS-CoV-2 is not the first coronavirus to cause widespread disease.
Two epidemics in the last two decades have been caused by coronaviruses: severe acute
respiratory syndrome (SARS) in 2002 and the Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS) in 2012.
Despite belonging to the same viral genus, SARS-CoV-2 has proven far more infectious, implying
molecular differences between the viruses. Understanding the molecular components of viral
proliferation in SARS-CoV-2 is therefore important to develop new therapeutics to combat COVID19.
SARS-CoV-2 packages a large RNA genome of ~30 kb which encodes for 25 nonstructural and four structural proteins (spike, nucleocapsid, membrane, and envelope proteins).
The nucleocapsid (N) protein is one of the most abundant viral proteins; hundreds of copies of N
make up the viral core that encapsulates the genomic RNA. In addition to its essential role in RNA
replication/transcription and virion assembly, coronavirus N proteins play essential roles in host
cell signaling pathways, immune system interference, cell cycle regulation, and chaperone
activity.2 Interestingly, the nucleocapsid and spike proteins are the main immunogens circulating
in the blood of COVID-19 patients.3 However, quantitative measurements of plasma or serum
from SARS-CoV-2 patients found that the adaptive immune response to the N protein is more
sensitive than the spike protein4, making it a better indicator of early disease and a good target
for antiviral therapies.
N protein has been the subject of much effort in structure elucidation in order to guide the
design of novel antivirals.5,6 Several compounds targeting nucleocapsid proteins of other viruses
have proven effective in in vitro studies, specifically blocking replication, transcription, and
assembly.7,8,9,10 However, the timeline for developing approved antivirals takes years and the
need for treatments to combat COVID-19 is urgent. Therefore, repurposing existing drugs is an
attractive and immediate solution to combat COVID-19.11 On this front, key host interactions have
been mapped for the proteins encoded by SARS-CoV-2 to identify host targets for drug
repurposing.12 One particular study revealed 66 potential drug targets, three of which are direct
interactors of N protein. The safe and effective use of new and existing therapeutics to target
specific viral processes however relies on an understanding of the sequence of interactions
between viral and host proteins and their controls.
Here, we present a comprehensive analysis of the SARS-CoV-2 N protein using native
mass spectrometry (MS), top-down fragmentation, and bottom-up sequencing. We find that the
full-length N protein undergoes proteolysis at highly conserved sites to generate at least five
unique proteoforms. We identify various stoichiometries of the proteoforms that are influenced by
pH and that may be critical targets in drug design. We evaluate the propensity for N and N
proteoforms to bind different RNA sequences and find that only the dimeric form of full-length N
binds to RNA, suggesting it is the functional unit of ribonucleoprotein assembly. In addition, we
show that two N proteoforms directly interact with cyclophilin A, a highly abundant cytosolic host
protein implicated in viral replication. We found that cyclosporin A, an immunosuppressive drug,
abolishes the interaction between N proteoforms and cyclophilin A. Finally, using convalescent
plasma from patients >6 months from initial COVID-19 diagnosis, we found that the antibody
response to the N-terminal proteoforms was significantly attenuated compared to the full-length

N protein. Interestingly, the antibody response for full-length protein and the C-terminal
proteoform were not statistically different, suggesting that the antigenic site for antibody
recognition is localized to the C-terminus of the N protein. Our results indicate that SARS-CoV-2
N protein is a multifunctional protein and propose that N proteoforms are primed for additional
functions related to viral propagation.

Results and Discussion
N Protein undergoes proteolysis in the vicinity of the linker region
Nucleocapsid proteins of coronaviruses share a similar topological organization13 and
show high sequence homology among related coronaviruses.14 The N protein is characterized by
two major structural domains, the RNA binding and oligomerization domain (Figure 1A). 15 Similar
to other coronavirus nucleocapsid proteins, the two domains are separated by a long and flexible
linker region thought to be devoid of secondary structure.2 An N-terminal arm and a C-terminal
tail flank the RNA binding and oligomerization domains, respectively. We constructed a plasmid
consisting of the full-length nucleocapsid protein, an N-terminal purification tag, and a cleavage
site (Figure 1A). We expressed and purified this construct in Escherichia coli and verified the
cleavage of the affinity tag via SDS-PAGE (Figure 1B). Before removal of the purification tag,
three distinct protein bands were detected at ~49, ~38 and ~28 kDa. Following removal of the tag,
all three protein bands migrated by ~3 kDa, or the mass of the tag (Table 1).
We confirmed that each band corresponded to N protein by in-gel trypsin digestion
followed by LC-MS-based bottom-up proteomics. All three bands contained peptides from the N
protein, resulting in 78.1%, 49.9%, and 43.2% sequence coverage for bands 1, 2, and 3,
respectively. To determine the representation of protein domains in each gel band, we plotted the
distribution of the peptides detected across the five protein domains (Figure 1C). As anticipated,
we observe an unbiased distribution of peptides across all five domains for band 1, consistent
with the expectation that tryptic peptides would be reasonably distributed across the full-length
protein. Over 50% of the total peptides detected in bands 2 and 3 were localized to the RNA
binding domain, suggesting that the proteins are predominantly N-terminal derivatives. However,
in all three bands, peptides located in the 58-residue C-terminal domain were detected, indicating
the purified protein is made up of a diverse mixture of N proteoforms16 and not biased to Nterminal species due to the location of the purification tag.
We recorded a native mass spectrum to identify the masses of the proteoforms present
together with the full-length protein (Figure 1D). Two main charge state envelopes centered at
13+ and 20+ species were identified, consistent with coexistence of monomers and dimers.
Deconvolution of the m/z signals provided experimental masses of 45,769 ± 1 Da and 91,537 ±
2 Da, respectively, which are in excellent agreement with the theoretical monomeric (45,769.83
Da) and dimeric (91,539.66 Da) masses of full-length N protein. The second distribution of
monomers and dimers have deconvoluted masses of 28,735 ± 2 Da and 57,534 ± 1 Da,
respectively. The SDS-PAGE analysis indicated the presence of additional proteoforms not visible
in this spectrum. We separated these lower molecular weight species from the full-length N using
size exclusion chromatography (Figure S1). The mass spectrum of the pooled fractions revealed
the presence of four additional proteoforms that range in mass from 22,612 to 42,922 Da.

Over several days, the mass spectrum evolved to reveal a series of peaks corresponding
to five unique protein distributions (Figure 2A). To determine the identity of each proteoform, we
adapted a two-tiered tandem mass spectrometry approach17 to determine intact mass and amino
acid sequence for each series of peaks in the mixture. An individual peak in the mass spectrum
was first isolated and subjected to electron transfer dissociation (ETD) under conditions that do
not result in the formation of fragments but instead produce a series of charge-reduced peaks
(Figure 2B). The charge-reduced spectrum was necessary to confirm the assignment of the
charge state series for each proteoform. The assigned charge states were then used to obtain
deconvoluted masses of each proteoform present in solution.
We tentatively assigned the proteoforms based on their intact masses and then generated
sequence ions to confirm our assignment. Individual proteoforms were subjected to fragmentation
by higher-energy collision induced dissociation (HCD), which accelerates the isolated ions into an
inert gas to induce fragmentation along the amide backbone. The fragmentation products were
then used to determine the molecular composition and to localize the exact site of cleavage. The
HCD spectrum results in a series of singly-, doubly-, and triply-charged sequence ions exemplified
by the fragmentation of the 9+ charge state at m/z 2616.79, Figure 2C. Fragmentation of intact
proteins under native conditions is expected to yield 3-10% sequence coverage at the termini18
and the propensity for fragmentation differs depending on several criteria (e.g. mass, charge,
composition, structure) for natively folded proteins.19 Here, we achieved ~4% sequence coverage
of the proteoforms by native top-down MS (Table S1). Fragmentation at the termini was
complementary to our goal – to confirm sites of cleavage that result in distinct proteoforms of N
protein.

Cleavage sites are highly conserved in the SARS-CoV-2 genome
Considering the proteoforms identified, we note that three result from cleavage after
alanine (residue pairs A|L, A|F, and A|A), one from cleavage following an arginine (R|M), and one
results from cleavage in the C-terminal tail following a valine (V|T), (Figure 2D). Proteoforms N1209 and N1-220 contain primarily the RNA binding domain as they cleave within the flexible linker
region. The major component of N1-273 is also the RNA binding domain, but in this case is followed
by the linker region and a small portion of the oligomerization domain. Conversely, N156-419
comprises mainly the oligomerization domain while still retaining a small portion of the RNA
binding domain.
Although we find no sequence similarity in the residues that flank each cleavage site, a
commonality is that cleavage occurs immediately adjacent to a hydrophobic residue. We were
intrigued to discover if the cleavage sites were subject to mutation. The locations of the gene and
amino acid mutations have been mapped for 38,318 SARS-CoV-2 genome sequences obtained
from the China National Center for Bioinformation 2019 Novel Coronavirus Resource.15 In the
sampled population, there were 200 amino acid mutations that occurred more than once, and
these substitutions were heavily localized at or near the linker region. The proteolytic sites at
A220, A273, A156, T392 were mutated only 4, 1, 9, and 2, times, in >38,000 genomes sequenced,
making them highly conserved. By comparison, the site at R209 was mutated a total of 36 times;
most commonly mutated to T via a G→C missense mutation at position 626 in the gene. The
specificity of cleavage at the conserved residues identified here, despite no common motif,
suggest that there may be a structural component directing proteolysis, however the exact

mechanism is unclear. This is supported by small angle x-ray scattering measurements which
demonstrate that the flexible linker region is not fully extended but contains elements of
structure.20

The oligomeric states of N proteoforms are influenced by pH
To better understand the role of the individual proteoforms we expressed and purified four
individual constructs and recorded native mass spectra of N1-209, N1-220, N1-273, and N156-419 from
solutions at different pH (Figures S3-S6). Mass spectra for N1-209 and N1-220 recorded at pH 5.0,
7.4 and 8.0 reveal highly abundant charge state series centered at 9+ and a low abundance
distribution of signals centered at the 13+ charge state corresponding to monomers and dimers,
respectively. The mass spectra for N1-273 show that it is predominantly monomeric with no
significant change in charge state distribution or oligomeric state across the range of pH values
tested. However, we observe two low abundant charge state series corresponding to N1-209 and
N1-220, suggesting that N1-273 continues to undergo cleavage at the previously mapped residues
(Figure S6).
In contrast to the N-terminal proteoforms, mass spectra for N156-419 reveal multiple charge
state distributions at pH 5.0, 7.4 and 8.0 (Figure S6). At pH 8, the mass spectrum reveals three
charge state distributions centered at 10+, 18+, and 27+ with average masses corresponding to
monomers, trimers, and a low population of hexamers (Table S2). At pH 7.4, monomers, dimers,
and trimers persist. At the lowest pH (pH 5.0) N156-419 is exclusively trimeric. Finally, the mass
spectra for full-length N at pH 5.0 and 8.0 reveal broadened and featureless peaks suggesting
that NFL is likely aggregated (Figure S7). A low abundance series of highly charged peaks
centered at 18+ at pH 8.0 indicates some protein unfolding. Overall, we conclude that N1-209, N1220, N1-273 do not undergo significant pH-dependent changes in oligomeric state while C-terminal
fragments are highly sensitive with trimers predominating under both high and low pH conditions.

RNA sequence influences binding stoichiometry
RNA binding and ribonucleoprotein complex formation is the primary function of
coronavirus N proteins. The N protein binds nucleic acid nonspecifically20, however the production
of infectious virions relies on N protein forming specific interactions with viral RNA among an
abundance of different cellular RNA species. With knowledge of the stoichiometries of NFL and N
proteoforms, we sought to determine the propensity for these species to bind specific RNA
sequences. We created single-stranded RNA oligonucleotides comprised of 20 nucleotides of
repeating sequences (4×-GAUGG, 4×-GAGAA). Considering the promiscuity of N protein, we
chose sequences shown to interact with the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) polyprotein
(which includes a nucleocapsid domain) at the different stages of virus assembly21 and
hypothesized that N proteins of different oligomeric states would exhibit similar bias toward
artificial RNA motifs.
We incubated N proteoforms and RNA oligonucleotides at a molar ratio of 4:1 protein:RNA
and recorded native mass spectra for all N protein-RNA complexes. The mass spectrum for N1209 bound to 4×-GAUGG (Figure 3A) reveals three charge state distributions with masses that
correspond to apo N1-209 monomer and N1-209 bound to one and two 4×-GAUGG RNA

oligonucleotides. The charge state distribution corresponding to N1-209 bound to two 4×-GAUGG
RNA predominates over the single RNA bound protein. Conducting the same experiment with a
different oligonucleotide (4×-GAGAA) reveals only one additional charge state distribution for N1209 bound to one oligonucleotide (Figure 3B). Similar RNA binding stoichiometries are observed
for N1-220 and N1-273; the mass spectra for N1-220 and N1-273 reveal distributions corresponding to
the binding of one and two 4×-GAUGG oligonucleotides. Only one additional distribution is
observed for N1-220 or N1-273 incubated with 4×-GAGAA oligonucleotide which corresponds to one
oligonucleotide bound, (Figures S8-9, Table S3) confirming the preference for the 4×-GAUGG
sequence for all N-terminal constructs.
To examine if this preference was also observed for full-length N, we incubated the protein
with 4×-GAUGG oligonucleotide. A series of peaks was identified corresponding to the N protein
dimer bound to two 4×-GAUGG oligonucleotides (Figure 3C). Similarly, in the presence of the 4×GAGAA RNA oligonucleotide, an additional RNA-bound distribution is observed, however the
deconvoluted mass indicates that only one 4×-GAGAA oligonucleotide is bound to the NFL dimer
(Figure S10, Table S3). No RNA binding to the monomeric form of NFL is observed, regardless of
oligonucleotide sequence. Considering the different properties of the two RNA oligonucleotides,
the 4×-GAUGG oligonucleotide contains three GGG motifs which form short stem-loops and are
known to contribute additively to the efficiency of genome packaging in related viruses.22
Furthermore, selective RNA packaging has been described as a feature of innate immune
response evasion.23 Our results emphasize that RNA sequence, and likely the secondary
structure, is important for interactions with the N-protein. Notably, only NFL dimer binds RNA,
suggesting that the dimer is the functional unit of the SARS-CoV-2 ribonucleoprotein assembly.
The preference for the RNA sequence known to form stem loops also has implications in efficient
genome packaging and likely contributes to an optimized packing density in the intact virion.
N proteoforms interact directly with cyclophilin A
Cyclophilin A (CypA), a highly abundant immunophilin found in host cells, has been
implicated in the replication cycle of coronaviruses24 and plays multifunctional roles in modulating
immune responses. We sought to determine if CypA plays a role in SARS-CoV-2 infection through
monitoring direct interactions of CypA with NFL or N proteoforms. We incubated N1-209 and CypA
in a 1:1 molar ratio and used native mass spectrometry to measure possible interactions. The
mass spectrum reveals charge state distributions that correspond to monomeric N1-209 and CypA,
and three distinct charge state distributions at m/z >3000 (Figure 4A). The three higher-m/z
distributions correspond to: (i) heterodimers of N1-209 and CypA, (ii) homodimers of CypA, and (iii)
a low population of homodimers of N1-209 (Table 2). We observe similar interactions for N1-273
(Figure S11). Notably, we do not observe evidence of CypA interacting with N1-220 or NFL under
the same conditions (Figure S12-14).
To determine if the interaction between N1-209 and CypA could be inhibited by an approved
immunosuppressant cyclosporin A (CsA), we incubated the N1-209:CypA-complex with a 2-fold
molar excess of the drug (Figure 4B). The mass spectrum reveals three abundant charge state
distributions: (i) a distribution centered at 9+ corresponding to N1-209 monomers, (ii) a highly
abundant distribution centered at a charge state of 8+ that corresponds to CypA bound to CsA,
and (iii) a low abundant distribution that corresponds to monomeric CypA (Table 2). Very low
abundance distributions of N1-209 homodimers, CypA homodimers, and N1-209-CypA heterodimers
are barely detected following magnification >3000 m/z. Therefore, we can conclude that the 1:1
interaction between CypA and the N1-209 proteoform can be inhibited by CsA binding to CypA.

Antigenic regions of N are located at the C-terminus
Since N protein is detected by antibodies with higher sensitivity than any other structural
proteins of SARS-CoV-24 we sought to determine if N proteoforms shared similar immunogenic
properties as NFL. We first incubated NFL with a monoclonal antibody (mAb) raised against the
full-length protein in molar ratios of 1:1 (Figure 5A). The mass spectrum reveals three distributions
>6000 m/z with deconvoluted masses that correspond to the apo antibody as well as one and two
NFL bound (Table 2, Figure S15). When the same mAb was incubated with three N-terminal
proteoforms (N1-209, N1-220, and N1-273) we did not observe any mAb binding in the mass spectrum
(Figure 5B). To validate these results with conventional methods we turned to protein detection
by Coomassie stain and immunoblotting (Figure 5B inset). The Coomassie stain detects NFL and
all proteoforms in high abundance as indicated by the dark blue bands. In contrast, the
immunoblot reveals dark bands for only NFL and N156-419, including higher order oligomers of N156419 that were not detected by Coomassie staining or mass spectrometry. N1-209 and N1-273 are barely
detectable by the mAb, and N1-220 completely evades mAb detection. This suggests that N1-209,
N1-220, and N1-273 may go undetected in viral infection. If this were the case, then we would expect
to see a lowered antibody response to these N-terminal fragments in convalescent plasma from
patients with COVID-19.
To test this hypothesis we obtained convalescent plasma from nine patients > 6 months
after an initial diagnosis of COVID-19 and studied the antibody response to the N proteoforms
characterized herein. The experiment was carried out using an enzyme-linked immunosorbent
assay (ELISA) using all five proteoforms (NFL, N1-209, N1-220, N1-273, N156-419) as the antigen to which
antibodies were captured. The plasma antibodies were “sandwiched” using an anti-IgG detection
antibody conjugated with horseradish peroxidase for colorimetric detection. The antibody
response for all nine patients was measured as a function of the absorbance and displayed as a
box plot (Figure 5C). Using the mAb bound to NFL as a positive control, we qualitatively concluded
that all proteoforms react with antibodies present in convalescent plasma. However, when
compared to NFL, the N-terminal proteoforms (N1-209, N1-220, N1-273) resulted in a significantly
attenuated antibody response. Interestingly, the antibody response for NFL and N156-419 were not
statistically different, suggesting that the antigenic site for antibody recognition is localized to the
C-terminus of the N protein. That this preferential antibody response is still detectable six months
after COVID-19 diagnosis implies that N156-419 is an attractive target for vaccine design against
SARS-CoV-2.
Conclusion
We present a comprehensive characterization of SARS-CoV-2 N protein and highlight
potential features that might influence SARS-CoV-2 infectivity (Figure 6). Specifically, we find that
N protein undergoes proteolysis at highly conserved residues in the vicinity of the linker region,
separating the two major domains (the RNA binding and oligomerization domains). We identify
various stoichiometries of N proteoforms that are influenced by pH, explicitly N156-419, which forms
stable oligomers under both high and low pH solution conditions. We also show that NFL and N
proteoforms bind RNA with a preference for GGG-motifs and present evidence for NFL dimers
being the functional unit of assembly in ribonucleoprotein complexes. Furthermore, we
determined that immunophilin CypA binds directly to N1-209 and N1-273, but not NFL or N1-220, an

interaction that can be inhibited through addition of the immunosuppressant cyclosporin A. To test
the immunogenicity of N proteoforms, we used a recombinant antibody and immunoblot
techniques to demonstrate that the antigenic site of SARS-CoV-2 N protein resides towards the
C-terminus. To test this in an in vivo scenario we obtained convalescent plasma from nine
patients > 6 months after initial COVID-19 diagnosis. We discovered a heightened response for
the NFL and N156-419 relative to N-terminal proteoforms N1-209, N1-220, and N1-273.
In general, proteolysis leads to changes in protein function and is a key strategy in viral
proliferation.25 The nucleocapsid protein of SARS-CoV, responsible for the SARS pandemic of
2002, was shown to undergo similar proteolytic cleavage, however the precise role of proteolysis
in SARS-CoV N protein remains elusive.26,27,28 New evidence reveals proteolytic cleavage of
multiple viral proteins during SARS-CoV-2 infection, including extensive cleavage of the N
protein.29 Our results share striking similarities with the cleavage sites observed for both SARSCoV and N protein from SARS-CoV-2 infected cells29 and therefore elucidating the role of N
proteoforms represents a necessary endeavor for targeting cellular processes involved in viral
proliferation.
One of the most critical steps of viral proliferation is the packaging of genomic material
and its assembly into new virions. Genome packaging of RNA viruses is highly selective and
depends on specific nucleotide sequences and complex structural elements called packaging
signals (Psi).30 It has recently been demonstrated that HIV polyproteins have a stronger tendency
to oligomerize in complex with Psi-RNA relative to non-Psi RNA.31 Our results indicate that NFL
and N proteoforms exhibit preference for RNA sequences that mimic key structural features of
the genomic RNA.32 We anticipate that the more efficient binding of N protein dimers to RNA with
GGG-motifs underlies the selective packaging of genomic RNA in SARS-CoV-2. The disruption
of structural features of viral RNA has been proven to inhibit replication in some viruses.33 In the
case of SARS-CoV-2, disruption of preferred RNA structures, and therefore disruption of N
protein-RNA interactions, presents a promising strategy to intervene in replication and the
potential to develop live attenuated vaccines.
Immunological roles of N proteoforms have been demonstrated by the highly specific
interactions between cyclophilin A and the N1-209 and N1-273, but not NFL. Cyclophilin A has been
found in mature virions of HIV and is known to play a key role in HIV replication. Interestingly, the
interaction between cyclophilin A and the HIV capsid protein is known to be conformationdependent34; we anticipate such parallels with SARS-CoV-2 and we can only speculate that N1220 does not interact with CypA because of a conformational change not exhibited by the other
proteoforms. In addition to its role in virus replication, cyclophilin A is implicated in inflammation
and is a mediator of cytokine production.35 In cases of severe COVID-19 infection, patients have
presented with aberrant inflammatory responses, known as “cytokine storms” which can be fatal.36
The symptoms identifying cytokine storms have been established,37 however, the viral
component(s) that trigger such a response have yet to be elucidated. We can only speculate that
specific interactions between N proteoforms and cyclophilin A, as demonstrated here, may play
a role in producing such an aberrant immune response. Pathways to intervene with such
interactions could therefore prove beneficial as a component of treatment strategies.
Considering antibody responses, proteoforms N1-209, N1-220, and N1-273 fail to activate the
same antibody response as the full-length protein. These proteoforms could thereby contribute to
virtually unchecked virus proliferation, depending on their functional roles. By contrast, N156-419
produced an antibody response from convalescent plasma that could not be differentiated from

the full-length protein. This result strongly implies that that the antigenic site of the N protein is
localized to the C-terminus which is in accord with epitope mapping of the homologous SARSCoV N protein.38,39,40,41 We speculate that the oligomerization of antigenic N156-419, which readily
forms dimers, trimers and hexamers as a function of pH, may serve to increase the avidity to
antibodies. We propose that N156-419 oligomers may act as decoys for neutralizing antibodies. This
proposal is in line with reports for a number of viruses, where antigenic proteins, or protein
complexes, are shed in high abundance to consume neutralizing antibodies.42,43,44 This strategy
has also been used in the development of antiviral therapies for SARS-CoV-2 wherein soluble
variants of the host receptor (decoy receptors) are used to bind and neutralize the infectious
virus.45
Several additional therapeutic avenues are highlighted by this study. Firstly, inhibition of
the proteolysis reaction would prevent the formation viral proteoforms that may be fine-tuned for
various functions within the viral lifecycle. While the mechanism behind the proteolysis of Nprotein is not yet understood, systematic mutation of cleavage sites defined here could lead to
mechanistic and structural insights to enable small molecule screening of potential protease
inhibitors. Knowledge of N protein- structured RNA interactions could also aid the design of new
therapeutics that would inhibit successful replication. However, since N protein oligomerizes in
the absence of RNA,46 de novo drug design of assembly inhibitors is complex as it is necessary
to consider oligomerization propensity of the various proteoforms at the pH regimes encountered
in the cellular environment. CsA and cyclosporine-derivatives, such as Alisporivir, however are
more straightforward to track and have become attractive candidates to treat COVID-19.47
Disruption of the cyclophilin A- N-proteoform interactions shown here provides a convenient
means of screening potential inhibitors for hit to lead optimization.
Finally, although we have uncovered many potential roles of N protein and its proteoforms,
interactions with at least nine host proteins involved in RNA processing have yet to be defined.12
Furthermore, defining post-translational modifications,48 and interactions with other host proteins
is a necessary endeavor that will provide a more complete knowledge of the multifaceted roles of
SARS-CoV-2 N protein. The results presented here however do prompt further investigation of a
number of therapeutic strategies including inhibition of the proteolyis reaction, perturbation of Nprotein RNA binding, prevention of cyclophilin A:proteoform interactions, and possible
development of N156-419 as a vaccine candidate. Given the likelihood that no one intervention is
likely to ameliorate the complex symptoms of COVID-19 infection, our findings contribute
proteoform-specific information that may guide some of the many therapies currently under
investigation.

Plasmid construction and cell growth. A codon-optimized synthetic gene corresponding to the
full length nucleocapsid protein (Thermo GeneArt, Regensburg, Germany) was cloned into a
modified pET28a vector using the In-Fusion cloning kit (Takara Bio Saint-Germain-en-Laye,
France). The resulting plasmid encoded for an N-terminal His6 tag followed by thrombin and
tobacco etch virus cleavage sequences upstream of the full-length nucleocapsid protein
sequence. To generate the nucleocapsid proteoforms, the desired sequences pertaining to the
truncated forms of the N protein were subcloned from the synthetic gene using polymerase chain
reaction (Phusion polymerase, New England Biolabs, Hertfordshire, UK). All genes were cloned
into the modified pet28 vector and gene sequences were confirmed by Sanger Sequencing.
Plasmids were transformed into BL21 (DE3) and streaked onto LB agar plates supplemented with
50 mg mL-1 kanamycin. Several colonies were used to inoculate 100 mL of LB broth
supplemented with kanamycin and grown at 37 °C overnight. 10 mL of the overnight precultures
were used to inoculate 1 L of LB broth supplemented with kanamycin. Cell cultures were grown
to OD600 ~ 0.6 before inducing protein expression with 0.5 µg mL-1 IPTG. Cells were grown for an
additional 4 hours at 37 °C before harvesting via centrifugation (5000 x g, 10 minutes, 4 °C). Cell
pellets were flash frozen in liquid nitrogen and stored at -80 °C until use.

Protein Purification. Cell pellets were resuspended in lysis buffer (25 mM Tris-HCl pH 8.0, 500
mM NaCl, 5 mM MgCl2, 5 mM β-mercaptoethanol, 5 mM imidazole, 10% v/v glycerol) containing
EDTA-free protease inhibitor tablets (Roche). Cells were lysed by five passes through a
microfluidizer (prechilled to 4 °C) at 20,000 psi. Cell debris was pelleted by centrifugation (20,000
x g, 20 minutes, 4 °C). The supernatant containing soluble nucleocapsid protein was passed
through a 0.45 µm filter.
Supernatant was loaded onto a Ni-NTA column pre-equilibrated in loading buffer (25 mM TrisHCl pH 8.0, 500 mM NaCl, 5 mM MgCl2, 5 mM β-mercaptoethanol, 20 mM imidazole, 10% v/v
glycerol) and allowed to pass via gravity flow. To remove common contaminating proteins, a heattreated BL21 (DE3) E. coli lysate in loading buffer containing 10 mM MgATP was passed over
the immobilized nucleocapsid protein using a protocol by Rial and Ceccarelli.49 The resin was
washed with 10 column volumes of wash buffer (25 mM Tris-HCl pH 8.0, 500 mM NaCl, 5 mM
MgCl2, 5 mM β-mercaptoethanol, 80 mM imidazole, 10% v/v glycerol), then eluted twice with 10
mL of elution buffer (25 mM Tris-HCl pH 8.0, 500 mM NaCl, 5 mM MgCl2, 5 mM βmercaptoethanol, 400 mM imidazole, 10% v/v glycerol).
The eluted protein was mixed with TEV protease in a 100:1 (w/w) and loaded into a 3 kDa MWCO
dialysis cassette (Thermo Fisher Scientific, United Kingdom). Cleavage of the His6-thrombin-TEV
tag was carried out overnight at 4 °C in lysis buffer. The cleaved tag and TEV protease were
separated from the untagged protein using reverse immobilized metal affinity chromatography on
a Ni-NTA column prepared in loading buffer. The flow-through containing the untagged protein
was collected and concentrated in a 10k MWCO centrifugal filter before MS analysis. Protein
concentration was determined using UV-VIS spectroscopy by monitoring the absorbance at 280
nm with a theoretical extinction coefficient (ε ~ 43890 M-1 cm-1) determined using the Expasy
Protparam tool.

Size Exclusion Chromatography. Full-length N protein and N proteoforms were separated using
a Superdex 10/300 increase GL column equilibrated in lysis buffer. Fractions corresponding to
NFL and N proteoforms were pooled and concentrated to ~10 µM before MS analysis.

Native Mass Spectrometry. RNA oligonucleotides of repeating sequences (4×-GAUGG, 4×GAGAA) were purchased from Integrated DNA Technologies. Recombinant human cyclophilin A
(product ab86219) was purchased from Abcam (Cambridge, United Kingdom). Cyclosporine A
purchased from Merck Life Science (Dorset, United Kingdom). N protein and all binding partners
were buffer exchanged or diluted into 500 mM NH4OAc pH 5.0, 7.4, or 8.0. Buffer exchange was
carried out using Zeba™ Spin Desalting Columns, 7K MWCO (Thermo Fisher Scientific, United
Kingdom).
Measurements were carried out on Qexactive UHMR or Orbitrap Eclipse. The Q-exactive
instrument was operated in the positive ion mode using the manufacturer’s recommended
parameters for native MS. The instrument was operated at a resolving power of 12,500 (at m/z
200). An electrospray was generated by applying a slight (~0.5 mbar) backing pressure to an inhouse prepared gold-coated electrospray capillary held at ~1.2 kV relative to the instrument orifice
(heated to ~100 °C).
An Eclipse Tribrid instrument was also used for native MS and top-down sequencing. The
instrument was set to intact protein mode at standard ion routing multipole pressure of 10 mTorr.
Ion voltages were set to transmit and detect positive ions at a resolving power of 12,500 (at m/z
200). An electrospray voltage of ~1.2 kV and ~0.5 mbar backing pressure were used for ion
formation; desolvation was assisted using an instrument capillary temperature of ~100 °C. To
identify the accurate mass and sequence of each proteoform, we used a similar approach to that
described by Huguet et al.17 Briefly, a desired signal was isolated using the ion trap (10 m/z
isolation window, charge state set to 10) and subjected to: (i) electron transfer dissociation (ETD,
3 ms activation time, 1.0x106 ETD reagent target) to generate a charge-reduced series for
accurate intact mass determination, and (ii) higher energy collisional dissociation (HCD) using
~30 – 50 V HCD collision energy to generate fragment ions.
Monoisotopic masses of fragment ions generated by HCD having a normalized intensity of 10%
or higher were fed into Prosite Lite software.50 A series of candidate sequences that best
matched the measured intact masses for each proteoform were generated. The monoisotopic
fragment masses were matched to expected ions generated in silico based on the provided
candidate sequence. Comparison of the statistical likelihood for each match compared to a series
of candidate sequences (Table S2) localized the cleavage sites to those outlined in Figure 2D.

Liquid Chromatography and Bottom-up Mass Spectrometry. Full-length N was separated
from the lower molecular weight proteoforms on a 0.8 mm 4-12% bis-tris SDS-PAGE gel
(Invitrogen) and stained with Coomassie Blue. Bands were excised from the gel, minced, and
digested with sequencing grade trypsin (Promega, Madison, WI, U.S.A) at 37 °C overnight,
extracted with 80% acetonitrile (0.1% formic acid), and dried on a vacuum concentrator. The
extracted peptides were resolubilized in buffer A (H2O, 0.1% FA) and loaded onto a reverse phase

trap column (Acclaim PepMap 100, 75µm x 2 cm, nano viper, C18, 3 µm, 100 Å, ThermoFisher,
Waltham, MA, U.S.A.) using an Ultimate 3000 for 50 µL at a flow rate of 10 µL min-1. The trapped
peptides were then separated using a 15 cm reverse phase analytical column (350 µm x 75 µm)
packed in-house (3 µm C18 particles) using a 60 min linear gradient from 5% to 40% buffer B
(80% acetonitrile, 20% water, 0.1% formic acid) at a flow rate of 300 nL min -1. The separated
peptides were then electrosprayed in the positive ion mode into an Orbitrap Eclipse Tribrid mass
spectrometer (ThermoFisher, San Jose, CA, USA) operated in data-dependent acquisition mode
(3 s cycle time). Precursor and product mass analysis occurred in the Orbitrap analyzer (120,000
and 60,000 resolving power at m/z 200, respectively). High intensity (threshold: 1.0 x 104)
precursors with charge state between z = 2 and z = 7 were isolated with the quadrupole (0.5 m/z
offset, 0.7 m/z isolation window) and fragmented using higher energy collision induced
dissociation (HCD collision energy = 30%). Additional MS/MS scans for precursors within 10 ppm
were dynamically excluded for 30 s following the initial selection. MS/MS scans were collected
using an automated gain control setting of 1.0 x 104 or a maximum fill time of 100 ms. LC-MS
data were searched against both the E. coli proteome manually annotated with the SARS-CoV-2
nucleocapsid protein sequence using MaxQuant v1.6.17.0.
Western Blot. Recombinant antibody generated from the full-length SARS-CoV-2 nucleocapsid
protein (product ab272852) and anti-human secondary antibody were purchased from Abcam.
Proteins were resolved on a 4-12% Bis-tris gel using SDS-PAGE and transferred to a PVDF
membrane (pore size 0.45 µm). The membrane was blocked in 5% milk in TPBS for 1 hour at RT,
incubated with primary antibody in 1:2000 dilution into blocking buffer (also 1 hour, RT) washed
with TPBS and incubated with secondary antibody (1:10000) in blocking buffer (also 1 hour, RT).
The PVDF membrane was incubated with Horseradish peroxidase chemiluminescent substrate
(Pierce ECL Western Blotting Substrate, Thermo Scientific) before detection on photographic film
and developed by an X-ray film processor (Xograph Compact X4).
Enzyme-Linked Immunosorbent Assay. Recombinant antibody generated from the full-length
SARS-CoV-2 nucleocapsid protein (product ab272852) and goat anti-human IgG (ab97225)
conjugated with horseradish peroxidase (HRP) purchased from Abcam. Nickel coated clear 96well plates were purchased from Thermo Scientific (Thermo Fisher Scientific, United Kingdom).
Plates came pre-blocked and 50 µg of his-tagged N proteoforms were loaded into each well and
allowed to incubate at room temperature for 1 hour. Plates were washed three times with 200 µL
of phosphate buffered saline (PBS) containing 0.05% Tween-20 (TPBS). Patient plasma was
diluted 8-fold with PBS and 100 µL was added to each well and the controls were carried out
using 20 ng of a monoclonal antibody raised against the full-length protein (ab272852) added to
wells containing NFL. Antibodies from patient plasma and the control antibody were allowed to
incubate overnight at 4 °C. Plates were washed three times with TPBS. Goat anti-human IgG
secondary antibody was diluted 1:50,000 in PBS, 100 µL added to each well, and the plates were
incubated at room temperature for 1 hour. Plates were washed a further 3 times with TPBS.
Colorimetric detection was carried out using a TMB chromogenic substrate kit for HRP detection
(Thermo Fisher Scientific, United Kingdom). The reaction was quenched after 5 minutes using 2
M sulfuric acid, resulting in a yellow color. Absorbance measurements were immediately carried
out at 450 nm using a microplate reader (BMG Labtech, Aylesbury, United Kingdom).

Figure 5. NFL and N proteoforms have distinct immunological roles. (A) Mass spectrum of NFL
after incubation with a monoclonal antibody raised against the full-length N protein in a molar
ratio of 1:1. We observe five charge state distributions that correspond to NFL monomers
(centered at 13+), NFL dimers (centered at 19+), monomeric antibody (centered at 21+),
antibody bound to one NFL (centered at 24+), and a population of antibody bound to NFL dimer
(centered at 30+). (B) Mass spectrum of a mixture of N1-209, N1-220, and N1-273 incubated with a

result was confirmed by immunoblot (see inset). SDS-PAGE shows that NFL, N1-209, N1-220, N1-273,

undergoes proteolysis in a highly specific fashion to produce N1-209, N1-220, N1-273, N156-419, and N1392. NFL and N proteoforms bind RNA with a preference for structured RNA and NFL dimers are
likely functional unit of assembly in ribonucleoprotein complexes. Immunophilin CypA binds
directly to N1-209 and N1-273, but not NFL or N1-220, and the interaction can be inhibited through
addition of cyclosporin A (CsA). N156-419 and NFL interact with antibodies from convalescent
