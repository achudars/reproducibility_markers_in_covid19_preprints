The zoonotic spillover of the pandemic SARS-coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) from an animal
reservoir, currently presumed to be the Chinese horseshoe bat, into a naïve human population has
rapidly resulted in a significant global public health emergency. Worldwide circulation of SARSCoV-2 in humans raises the theoretical risk of reverse zoonosis events with wildlife,
reintroductions of SARS-CoV-2 into permissive non-domesticated animals, potentially seeding
new host reservoir species and geographic regions in which bat SARS-like coronaviruses have
not historically been endemic. Here we report that North American deer mice (Peromyscus
maniculatus) and some closely related members of the Cricetidae family of rodents possess key
amino acid residues within the angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) receptor known to
confer SARS-CoV-2 spike protein binding. Peromyscus rodent species are widely distributed
across North America and are the primary host reservoirs of several emerging pathogens that
repeatedly spill over into humans including Borrelia burgdorferi, the causative agent of Lyme
disease, deer tick virus, and Sin Nombre orthohantavirus, the causative agent of hantavirus
pulmonary syndrome (HPS). We demonstrate that adult deer mice are susceptible to SARS-CoV2 infection following intranasal exposure to a human isolate, resulting in viral replication in the
upper and lower respiratory tract with little or no signs of disease. Further, shed infectious virus
is detectable in nasal washes, oropharyngeal and rectal swabs, and viral RNA is detectable in
feces and occasionally urine. We further show that deer mice are capable of transmitting SARSCoV-2 to naïve deer mice through direct contact. The extent to which these observations may
translate to wild deer mouse populations remains unclear, and the risk of reverse zoonosis and/or
the potential for the establishment of Peromyscus rodents as a North American reservoir for
SARS-CoV-2 is unknown. Nevertheless, efforts to monitor wild, peri-domestic Peromyscus
rodent populations are likely warranted as the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic progresses.

Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is the causative agent of
coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), an acute respiratory illness that emerged in Wuhan,
China in late 20191, initiating a global pandemic associated with millions of infections, hundreds
of thousands of deaths, and severe social and economic disruption. SARS-CoV-2, a positivesense RNA virus of the betacoronavirus genus, is closely related to the high-consequence
respiratory viruses, SARS-CoV and Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERSCoV). While the majority of SARS-CoV-2 infections result in asymptomatic2,3 or mild
respiratory disease4,5 some individuals progress to more severe disease that can result in
admittance to an intensive care unit (ICU) and/or the need for oxygen therapy or invasive
mechanical ventilation and can result in serious multi-organ sequelae and death. The severity of
disease and likelihood of mortality often correlates with advanced age, compromised immune
status, and the pre-existence of certain cardiovascular, pulmonary, and metabolic comorbidities4,6. Human-to-human transmission of SARS-CoV-2 is believed to occur primarily
through short-range respiratory droplets and aerosols emitted by infected individuals during
coughing, sneezing, speaking, breathing, or as a result of aerosol-generating medical
procudures7. Individuals ranging from pre-symptomatic, asymptomatic, mildly symptomatic to
fulminant symptomatic are thought to be capable of transmitting SARS-CoV-28,9.

Like the other non-seasonal human coronaviruses, SARS-CoV10,11 and MERS-CoV12,13, SARSCoV-2 is believed to be of bat origin11,14,15 although related viruses have also been identified in
wild pangolins16. Examinations of amino acid sequences of the SARS-CoV-2 receptor,
angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (Ace2), from various vertebrate species predicts that additional
wild animal species may be susceptible17,18. Several experimental animal models of SARS-CoV2 infection have been reported including transgenic mice that express human Ace2 (hAce2)19,20
and mouse-adapted SARS-CoV-221,22 as well as tree shrews23, hamsters24,25, ferrets26,27, fruit
bats28, rhesus macaques29, cynomolgus macaques30, marmosets30, and African green monkeys31
that are innately susceptible to infection with wildtype SARS-CoV-2. Experimental transmission
by both direct and indirect contact has been reported for hamsters24,25, ferrets27, and domestic
cats26,32. Lastly, there have been documented instances of unintentional human-to-animal
transmission (zooanthroponosis) with several species of captive or domesticated animals
including tigers33, mink34, cats26,35, and dogs36.

After Syrian hamsters (Mesocricetus auratus) were identified to be a SARS-CoV-2-susceptible
host species24,25, we sought to determine whether or not deer mice (Peromyscus maniculatus)
were also susceptible hosts since they, like hamsters, are members of the Cricetidae family of
rodents (Fig. 1a). Peromyscus species rodents are susceptible to persistent infections with and are
the natural host reservoirs of several important zoonotic pathogens including: Borrelia
burgdorferi, the causative agent of Lyme disease37,38, deer tick virus (DTV)39, and Sin Nombre
orthohantavirus (SNV)40,41. Deer mice and closely related white-footed mice (Peromyscus
leucopus) are widely distributed across North America (Fig. 1b). We examined deer mouse Ace2
for congruence with human Ace2 (hAce2) at key amino acid residues known to confer efficient
binding to the SARS-CoV-2 Spike (S) (Fig. 1c) and came to a conclusion consistent with recent
reports that deer mice were likely to be susceptible hosts17,42. We found that deer mouse Ace2
differed from hAce2 S-contacting residues at four locations and that the amino acid differences
were unlikely to have a detrimental effect on S binding efficiency43. We further found that Ace2
belonging to the white-footed mouse had in common all but three hAce2 S-contacting residues,
and white-footed mouse Ace2 has since been shown to bind S and confer entry to SARS-CoV-2
into Hela cells18.

Here, eight to thirty two-week old male or female deer mice (P. maniculatus rufinus; in-house
colony) were inoculated with 105 TCID50 of SARS-CoV-2 by an intranasal route (i.n.) and
monitored daily for clinical signs and weight loss for 21 days or necropsied at 2 and 4 day postinfection (dpi). SARS-CoV-2-exposed deer mice seldom displayed clinical signs (occasionally
presenting with ruffled fur), and no animals succumbed to infection (Fig. 2a) or lost weight (Fig.
2b) at any point post-infection with no differences noted related to age. At 2 dpi high levels of
viral RNA (vRNA; ~108-1010 genome equivalents/g) were detected in the nasal turbinates and
lungs, and infectious virus (up to 3.3x107 TCID50/g and 1.5x107 TCID50/g) was detected in the
nasal turbinates and lungs (Fig. 2 c-d). At 4 dpi infectious virus detected in the nasal turbinates
had declined by several logs while lungs titers had declined to a lesser extent (ranging from
3x103 to 1.4x105 TCID50/g and 6.8x104 to 3.4x106 TCID50/g, respectively). Age did not make a
significant contribution to the viral burden detected in the tissues (Extended Data Fig. 1). At 2
and 4 dpi high levels of vRNA (~105 – 108 genome copies/g) were detected in the small intestine
and colon tissues (Fig. 2 e-f), and infectious virus was present at a low level. To monitor viral
shedding, oropharyngeal and rectal swabs were collected every 2 days from 2-8 dpi (Fig. 2g-h).
High levels of vRNA (~105 – 107 genome copies/ml) were detected on 2 and 4 dpi in
oropharyngeal swabs, and both vRNA and infectious virus peaked at 2 dpi and declined

thereafter (Fig. 2g). Moderate levels of vRNA (~103 – 105 genome copies/ml) were detected on 2
and 4 dpi in rectal swabs, and vRNA peaked at 2 dpi and declined thereafter (Fig. 2h). Infectious
virus in rectal swabs was detected on 2, 4, 6, and 8 dpi at or near the limit of detection (Fig. 2h).
Viral RNA was detected in nasal washes at 6 dpi in the four deer mice for which samples were
obtained (~105 – 106 genome copies/ml) (Fig. 2i). An additional experimental group of deer mice
(n = 5) were inoculated i.n. with 106 TCID50 of SARS-CoV-2. In this group vRNA was detected
in urine samples at 6 dpi in one deer mouse (~104 genome copies/ml) (Fig. 2j) and feces at 4 dpi
in all deer mice (~104 – 106 genome copies/g) (Fig. 2k). Viral RNA in blood was detected on 1
dpi, indicating transient viremia that declined in most animals by 3 dpi (Fig. 2l). Studies to
examine the vectorial capacity of selected tick species such as Ixodes scapularis for SARS-CoV2
may be warranted. An additional experimental group of deer mice (n = 4) was inoculated i.n.
with 105 TCID50 of SARS-CoV-2, and tissues were harvested at 21 dpi (Fig. 2m). In this group
vRNA was detected in the nasal turbinates (~105 – 107 genome copies/g) and lungs (~104 – 106
genome copies/g) of all deer mice and in the small intestine of two deer mice (~104 genome
copies/g), indicating persistence of vRNA in organs that to our knowledge has not been reported
in other animal models studied thus far.

Lesions in animals infected at 105 TCID50 were largely absent from nasal turbinates except for
mild neutrophilic infiltration in the submucosa at 4 dpi (Fig. 3a, left panel). Abundant vRNA was
primarily detected in epithelial cells at 2 and 4 dpi (Fig. 3a, middle panels) and anti-genomic
RNA could be detected occasionally in epithelial cells at 2 dpi only (Fig. 3a, right panels).
Histopathologic examination of lung tissue revealed lesions that included perivascular and
peribronchiolar infiltrations of histiocytes and neutrophils with occasional multinucleated
syncytial cells (Fig. 3b, left panel). Occasional discrete foci of interstitial pneumonia were
observed (Fig. 3b, left panel). Abundant vRNA was primarily detected in bronchiolar epithelial
cells and occasionally in the interstitium (Fig. 3b, middle panels). Anti-genomic RNA could be
detected in individual scattered bronchiolar epithelial cells (Fig. 3b, right panels). Lung lesions
were largely absent at 21 dpi although some foci of inflammation with syncytia were identified,
and vRNA was not detected in the lungs by ISH despite qRT-PCR positivity (Extended Data Fig.
2).
Blood biochemistry and hematological parameters were compared for uninfected (n = 5) and
SARS-CoV-2-infected deer mice (n = 3; 106 TCID50) (Fig. 4a-e). Both groups showed similar
levels of white blood cells; however, infected deer mice had reduced lymphocyte counts and
elevated neutrophil counts (Fig. 4a). These data appear to recapitulate the trend in hematologic
values observed in COVID-19 patients, where lymphocytopenia with elevated neutrophil counts
can occur44. One out of three infected deer mice had a dramatically elevated neutrophil-tolymphocyte rate (NLR), a clinical metric that has been found to be elevated in human patients
during severe COVID-1945, and the NLR was significantly elevated in all infected deer mice (P
< 0.05, Mann-Whitney test). The lack of a difference in alanine aminotransferase (ALT) (Fig.
4c), and the reduced values for blood albumin (ALB) (Fig. 4d) and blood urea nitrogen (BUN)
(Fig. 4e), when uninfected and infected deer mice were compared suggests that infection did not
cause liver and kidney impairment. Additional serum biochemical values were unremarkable
(Extended Data Fig. 3). Transcriptional profiling of host cytokine expression in the lungs by realtime PCR using a previously reported panel that includes TNFa, IL-6, IL10, and IFNa46 was
carried out 2 dpi (Fig. 4f) and compared to uninfected controls (n = 6). TNFa and IL-6 mRNA
expression was elevated in all infected mice (mean fold changes of 22.7 and 23.5, respectively). IL-

10 mRNA expression was elevated in five out of six infected animals and reduced in one (mean
fold change of 21.5 ). In contrast, IFNa was elevated in two and reduced in four infected deer
mice (mean fold change of 2-0.8). Overall, the mRNA levels of inflammatory cytokines (TNFa,
IL-6, and IL10) were slightly elevated compared to what is seen in the lungs of deer mice (~2 – 5
fold increase) following experimental infection with SNV47. All five deer mice infected at 105
TCID50 had detectable serum IgG titers against mixed spike/nucleoprotein (S/N) antigen as
assessed by ELISA at 14 dpi (OD 2.7 – 2.8 at 1:100) (Fig. 4g), and neutralizing antibodies by 28
dpi (plaque reduction neutralization test (PRNT90) 1:40 to 1:320) (Fig. 4h).
Transmission by direct contact was examined between SARS-CoV-2-infected and naïve deer
mice (experimental design schematic, Extended Data Fig. 4). Five adult male and female deer
mice, infected i.n. with 106 TCID50 SARS-CoV-2 were each transferred to a new cage at 1 dpi
and co-housed with a single naïve contact deer mouse (1:1 ratio; zero days post-direct contact
(dpc)). Oropharyngeal and rectal swab samples taken every other day revealed that initially one
contact animal (DM7, Fig. 5 a-b) rapidly became infected and shed moderate levels of vRNA as
early as 2 dpc. The level of vRNA in both swab samples from DM7 continued to increase for the
next 4 (oropharyngeal swabs) or 2 (rectal swabs) days then declined. The remaining contact deer
mice had detectable vRNA in oropharyngeal and rectal swab samples at low levels from 2 - 4
dpc which declined until 10 dpc when shed vRNA was again detected in both oropharyngeal and
rectal swabs from all contact deer mice (including DM7). Interestingly, despite the high
challenge dose administered to donor deer mice only low amounts of infectious virus were
detected in swabs (Fig. 5c-d). Infectious virus was detected in oropharyngeal and rectal swabs of
contact deer mouse DM7 at 4 dpc and an oropharyngeal swab sample from contact deer mouse
DM6 at 10 dpc. An additional transmission study was carried out in the same manner and nasal
wash, nasal turbinates, and lung samples were collected from contact animals at 2 and 4 dpc
(Fig. 5e-f). Viral RNA was detected in nasal wash, nasal turbinates, and the lungs of contact deer
mice DM19 (2 dpc) and DM30 (4 dpc), as well as in the nasal wash of deer mouse DM17 (2
dpc), DM26 (4 dpc) and DM28 (4 dpc). IgG against mixed SARS-CoV-2 spike/nucleoprotein
antigens were detected in deer mouse DM7 at 21 dpc, indicating seroconversion and confirming
that direct contact transmission had occurred (Fig. 5g). A similar, but more stringent
transmission study was carried out using a lower dose of virus (105 TCID50), and donor and naïve
deer mice were mixed at 2 dpi (Fig. 5h-i). Oropharyngeal and rectal swab samples taken every
other day revealed that contact deer mice had detectable vRNA in both oropharyngeal and rectal
swab samples from 2 - 4 dpc at a low levels, which declined until 6-10 dpc after which shed
vRNA was again detected in oropharyngeal swabs from four out of five and rectal swabs from
three out of five contacts. At 21 dpc vRNA was detected in the oropharyngeal swabs of two of
five contact and was not detected in any rectal swab samples.
The described experiments demonstrate that adult deer mice are susceptible to experimental
infection with a human isolate of SARS-CoV-2, resulting in asymptomatic infection or mild
disease with lesions limited to mild lung pathology, despite a high viral burden and elevated
levels of inflammatory cytokines in the lungs and seroconversion. The detected RNA viremia in
SARS-CoV-2-infected deer mice appears to be more transient than what is observed in deer mice
experimentally infected with SNV48; however, the viral shedding and the propensity for direct
contact transmission appears to be greater41,48. The relatively low amount of shed infectious virus
from nasal, oral, and rectal routes consistently result in direct contact transmission from infected

to co-housed naive deer mice. SNV is also detectable in deer mouse feces and urine, and
zoonotic transmission of SNV into humans is thought to result from unintentional ingestion or
inhalation of contaminated deer mouse excreta49. Additional studies should be carried out to
determine if vRNA detected in the feces and occasionally urine is indicative of the presence
infectious virus.

Concerns have justifiably been raised about the potential for reverse zoonosis, human-to-animal
transmission of SARS-CoV-2 into susceptible wild animal host species50. The introduction of
novel pathogens into susceptible wildlife hosts can have devastating effects on wildlife
populations51. The findings reported here suggest that the impacts of SARS-CoV-2 on infected
Peromyscus species rodents are likely to be minimal; however, wild deer mouse populations may
be more or less susceptible to infection than the experimentally housed animals we have
described. An additional concern is the potential for zoonotic maintenance of SARS-CoV-2 in an
animal reservoir and/or geographic region where SARS-like coronaviruses had not previously
been endemic. The findings reported here are concerning in light of the fact that Peromyscus
species rodents tolerate persistent infection with and serve as the primary reservoirs for several
emerging zoonotic pathogens that spillover into humans, including Borrelia burgdorferi37,38,
DTV39, and SNV40,41. It should be acknowledged that although deer mice are widely distributed
in North America and can live in close proximity to humans, the actual risk of human-to-deer
mouse transmission remains unknown. Further, it remains unclear how well the transmission
studies we describe translate to the risk of sustained transmission within wild deer mouse
populations. The theoretical risk of zoonotic transmission of SARS-CoV-2 back to humans from
Peromyscus species rodents would depend on additional unknowns such as whether infectious
virus is present in excreta at high enough levels to initiate human infection and whether other
wild or domestic animal species might serve as an intermediary host. Efforts to monitor wild,
especially peri-domestic Peromyscus rodent populations are likely warranted as the SARS-CoV2 pandemic continues to progress.

Lastly, we suggest that the deer mouse model of SARS-CoV-2 infection, as a largely outbred
small animal model, may prove useful for studying viral pathogenesis and for evaluating the
protective efficacy of experimental vaccines and therapeutics.

Figure 4: Deer mouse host response to SARS-CoV-2 infection.
a-e, Hematological levels and serum biochemistry were measured in uninfected and SARS-CoV2-infected deer mice (infectious dose 106 TCID50, i.n. route) at 3 dpi, including (a) white blood
cell, lymphocyte, and neutrophil counts, (b) the neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio, (c) alanine
aminotransferase (ALT), (d) blood albumin (ALB), and (e) blood urea nitrogen (BUN). f,
Cytokine gene expression was measured for TNFa, IL-6, IL-10, and IFNa in the lungs of SARSCoV-2-infected deer mice and displayed relative to age-matched mock-infected animals. Gene
expression was normalized using GAPDH as a control. g, IgG antibody response against SARSCoV-2 mixed spike and nucleoprotein (S/N) antigens were assessed by ELISA using serum
collected on the indicated days post-infection (infectious dose, 105 TCID50). h, Neutralizing
antibody against SARS-CoV-2 was measured by PRNT90 using serum collected at 28 days after
SARS-CoV-2 infection (infectious dose, 105 TCID50). Dotted lines indicate the limit of
detection. Bars indicate mean, error bars indicate SEM (c-e) or 95% confidence interval (f). (a-b,
n = 5/3 for uninfected/infected; c-e, n = 5/4 for uninfected/infected, f, n = 6, g-h, n = 5 or 6) * =
P < 0.05, ns = P > 0.05, Mann-Whitney test (b), unpaired t test (c-e).
Figure 5: Transmission of SARS-CoV-2 between deer mice through direct contact.
a-g, Adult male and female deer mice were exposed to 106 TCID50 SARS-CoV-2 by an i.n. route
of infection. At 1 dpi individual inoculated donor deer mice were transferred to a new cage and
co-housed with a single naïve deer mouse (1:1 ratio) to assess SARS-CoV-2 transmission by
direct contact. Deer mice were either maintained in direct contact throughout the 10 day study
for serial swabbing or humanely euthanized on 2 or 4 days post-contact (dpc) for tissue
collection. a-d, Viral RNA levels (a, b) and infectious viral loads (c, d) were measured in
oropharyngeal swabs and rectal swab samples every other day from -1 to 10 days after direct
contact was initiated. Oropharyngeal or rectal swab samples obtained from the same animal are
demarcated with a unique colour, and samples derived from co-housed pairs share the same
symbol. e-f, An additional transmission study was carried out in the same manner and nasal
wash, nasal turbinates, and lung samples were collected from contact animals at (e) 2 dpc and (f)
4 dpc. g, IgG antibody response (reciprocal serum dilution) against SARS-CoV-2 S and N in
donor and direct-contact exposed animals were assessed by ELISA using serum collected at 21
dpc. h-i, In an additional study adult male and female deer mice were exposed to 105 TCID50
SARS-CoV-2 by an intranasal route of infection. At 2 dpi individual inoculated donor deer mice
were transferred to a new cage and co-housed with a single naïve deer mouse (1:1 ratio) to assess
SARS-CoV-2 transmission by direct contact (n = 5). Viral RNA levels were measured in (h)
oropharyngeal swabs and (i) rectal swab samples every other day from 0 to 14 days after direct
contact was initiated, and final swab samples were collected at 21 dpi and assessed. Dotted or

Ethics statement
The experiments described in this study were carried out at the National Microbiology
Laboratory (NML) at the Public Health Agency of Canada as described in the Animal use
document AUD# H-20-006. Experiment were approved by the Animal Care Committee located
at the Canadian Science Center for Human and Animal Health in accordance with the guidelines
provided by the Canadian Council on Animal Care. All procedures were performed under
anesthesia, and all efforts were made to minimize animal suffering and to reduce the number of
animals used. All infectious work was performed under biosafety level 3 (BSL-3) conditions or
higher.
Viruses
The SARS-CoV-2 strain used in these studies (SARS-CoV-2; hCoV- 19/Canada/ON-VIDO01/2020, GISAID accession# EPI_ISL_425177) was isolated from a clinical specimen obtained at
the Sunnybrook Research Institute (SRI)/ University of Toronto on VeroE6 cells and provided by
the Vaccine and Infectious Disease Organization (VIDO) with permission. The P1 virus was
subsequently passaged at a 1:1000 dilution on mycoplasma-free VeroE6 cells (ATCC) in
Dulbecco's Modified Eagle's Medium (Hyclone) containing 1% L-glutamine and 0.5 µg/ml of
TPCK-trypsin and harvested when 80% cytopathic effect (CPE) became evident. The P2 virus
stock was clarified by centrifugation at 6000 x g for 5 minutes and stored at -80°C until thawed
for deer mouse infections. The virus stock was titrated on Vero cells by conventional TCID50 assay,
as described previously53.
Deer mouse challenge experiments
Deer mice (Peromyscus maniculatus rufinus) used in these studies were supplied by a breeding
colony housed at the University of Manitoba in a pathogen-free facility. All the deer mice were
acclimated for a minimum of one week prior to the initiation of experimental procedures. Deer
mice were randomly assigned to their respective groups and were housed in a temperaturecontrolled, light-cycled facility. Deer mice were supplied with food and water ad libitum and were
monitored daily throughout the course of the experiments. Thirteen to thirty two-week old male
or female deer mice were infected with 105 or 106 TCID50 of SARS-CoV-2 by an intranasal route
(i.n.) of administration in a 50 µl volume. Blinding of the animal experiments was not performed.
Sample sizes were calculated a priori, and no animals were excluded from the data analysis
although at times sample volumes were insufficient to allow downstream analyses.
Blood, fluids, feces, swab, and tissue collection
All deer mice were exsanguinated via cardiac puncture under deep isoflurane anesthesia prior to
euthanization. Whole blood and serum was collected in BD microtainer tubes (K2-EDTA or serum,
respectively) (Becton, Dickinson and Company) as per the manufacturer’s instructions. Serum
samples were collected from the retro-orbital sinus under deep isoflurane sedation at 14, 21, and
28 dpi for challenge studies and at 21 dpc for transmission studies. Orophryngeal and rectal swabs
were taken using fine tip Dryswab Fine Tip rayon swabs (MWE cat #MW113). Harvested tissue
samples for infectious assays were flash frozen and stored at −80 °C until later use, and swab
samples were placed in 1 ml MEM supplemented with 1% heat-inactivated FBS, 1x L-glutamine,

and 2x penicillin–streptomycin, flash frozen, and stored at −80 °C until later use. Tissue samples
harvested for vRNA detection were immersed in RNAlater (Ambion) 4 °C for 1 day, then stored
at −80 °C until later use. For urine collection deer mice were gently raised from their cages using
soft-tip mouse handling forceps and placed immediately onto a 35-mm petri dish, a process that
consistently allowed a minimum of 25 µl of urine to be collected. Feces samples were collected
fresh from the isoflurane chamber following sedation, homogenized in 0.5 ml of 0.89% NaCl per
80 mg of feces using a Bead Ruptor Elite Bead Mill Homogenizer (Omni International) with a
stainless steel bead at 4 m/s for 30 seconds. The sample was then clarified for 20 minutes at 4000
x g and the supernatant was filtered through a 0.2 µm filter. Viral RNA was then isolated using
the QIAamp Viral RNA Mini kit (Qiagen), as per the manufacturer’s instructions.
Infectious virus in tissues and swab samples
For infectious virus assays, thawed tissue samples were weighed and placed in 1 ml of MEM
supplemented with 1% heat-inactivated FBS, 1x L-glutamine before being homogenized in a Bead
Ruptor Elite Bead Mill Homogenizer (Omni International) at 4 m/s for 30 seconds and clarified
by centrifugation at 1500 x g for 6 minutes. Swab samples were vortexed for 10 seconds and
clarified at 2400 rpm for 5 minutes. Tissue homogenates or swab samples were serially diluted 10fold in MEM supplemented with 1% heat-inactivated FBS, 1x L-glutamine, and 2x penicillin–
streptomycin. One hundred microliter volumes of neat samples (swabs only) and sample dilutions
were added to 96-well plates of 95% confluent Vero cells containing 50 µl of the same medium in
replicates of three and incubated for 5 days at 37 °C with 5% CO2. Plates were scored for the
presence of cytopathic effect on day 5 after infection.
Viral RNA copies in tissues and swab samples
For vRNA copy number analysis, tissue samples were thawed and weighed and homogenized in
600 µl RLT buffer using a Bead Ruptor Elite Bead Mill Homogenizer (Omni International) with a
stainless steel bead at 4 m/s for 30 seconds. Viral RNA from 30 mg tissue samples was extracted
with the RNeasy Plus Mini kit (Qiagen), and vRNA from swab samples was extracted with the
QIAamp Viral RNA Mini kit (Qiagen). A SARS-CoV-2 E-specific real-time RT–PCR assay was
used for the detection of vRNA54. RNA was reverse transcribed and amplified using the primers
E_Sarbeco_F1 (5′- ACAGGTACGTTAATAGTTAATAGCGT-3′) and E_Sarbeco_R2 (5′ATATTGCAGCAGTACGCACACA-3′)
and
probe
E_Sarbeco_P1
(5′-FAMACACTAGCCATCCTTACTGCGCTTCG-BBQ-3′) using the TaqPath 1-Step Multiplex Master
Mix kit (Applied Biosystems) on a QuantStudio 5 real-time PCR system (Appiled Biosystems), as
per manufacturer’s instructions. A standard curve was generated in parallel for each plate using
synthesized DNA and used for the quantification of viral genome copy numbers. The Design and
Analysis Software version 1.5.1 (ThermoFisher Scientific) was used to calculate the cycle
threshold values, and a cycle threshold value ≤36 for both replicates was considered positive.
Blood counts and biochemistry
Complete blood counts were carried out using a VetScan HM5 hematology system (Abaxis
Veterinary Diagnostics), as per manufacturer instructions. Analysis of serum biochemistry was
performed with a VetScan VS2 analyzer (Abaxis Veterinary Diagnostics), as per manufacturer
instructions.

Transcriptional profiling of host responses
RNA was extracted from tissues using the RNeasy plus mini kit (Qiagen) following the
manufacturer’s instructions. A two-step qRT-PCR reaction in triplicate was performed on a
Quantstudio 5 (Applied Biosystems). Reverse transcription was carried out with the Superscript
III RT first strand synthesis kit (Invitrogen) following DNase elimination of genomic DNA. The
RT reaction was performed using 100 ng of template RNA mixed with random hexamers as
primers in a 20 µL reaction volume for 5 min at 65 °C followed by 10 min at 25 °C and 50 min at
50 °C. The qPCR reaction was carried out using the PowerUp SYBR Green Master Mix (Applied
Biosystems) with 2 µL of cDNA. The cycle parameters for qPCR were 2 min at 50 °C and 2 min
at 95°C followed by 40 cycles of 3 s at 95 °C and 30 s at 60 °C. The qPCR reactions were
performed in a 20 µL volume with oligonucleotide pairs specific for deer mouse TNFa, IL6, IL10,
IFNa55 at a concentration of 2 µM. The fold change in gene expression of TNFa, IL6, IL10, IFNa
in SARS-CoV-2-infected versus uninfected deer mice were calculated using the ΔΔCt method
with GAPDH as a reference gene56. GraphPad Prism’s multiple t test was used to perform the
second subtraction so as not to lose the variation of the mock animals.
SARS-CoV-2-S-specific enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA)
SARS-CoV-2 spike/nucleoprotein (S/N)-specific IgG antibody responses were assessed using an
in-house assay. Briefly, a 1:100 dilution (or a serial dilution) of deer mouse serum was carried out
in duplicate and added to plates pre-coated with both the spike and nucleoprotein (S/N) antigens
in the same assay wells. Deer mouse IgG was detected with a KPL peroxidase-labeled polyclonal
goat antibodies against Peromyscus leucopus IgG (H+L) (Sera Care).
Virus neutralization assay
Deer mouse serum samples were collected and stored at -80°C. SARS-CoV-2 stocks were
titrated and used in the PRNT57. Briefly, serum was heat-inactivated at 56°C for 30 minutes and
diluted 2-fold from 1:40 to 1:1280 in DMEM supplemented with 2% FBS. Diluted sera was
incubated with 50 plaque forming units of SARS-CoV-2 at 37°C and 5% CO2 for 1 hour. The
sera-virus mixtures were added to 24-well plates containing Vero E6 cells at 100% confluence,
followed by incubation at 37 °C and 5% CO2 for 1 hour. After adsorption, 1.5%
carboxymethylcellulose diluted in MEM supplemented with 4% FBS, L-glutamine, non-essential
amino acids, and sodium bicarbonate was added to each well and plates were incubated at 37°C
and 5% CO2 for 72 hours. The liquid overlay was removed and cells were fixed with 10%
neutral-buffered formalin for 1 hour at room temperature. The monolayers were stained with
0.5% crystal violet for 10 minutes and washed with 20% ethanol. Plaques were enumerated and
compared to a 90% neutralization control. The PRNT-90 endpoint titre was defined as the
highest serum dilution resulting in 90% reduction in plaques. PRNT-90 titers ≥1:40 were
considered positive for neutralizing antibodies.
Histopathology and vRNA in situ hybridization
Tissues were fixed in 10% neutral phosphate buffered formalin for two to four weeks.
Subsequently, routine processing was carried out and tissue samples were sectioned at 5 µm. A
set of slides was stained with hematoxylin and eosin for histopathologic examination. RNA in
situ hybridization (ISH) was carried out using RNAscope 2.5 HD Detection Reagent-Red
(Advanced Cell Diagnostics), according to the manufacturer’s instructions. Briefly, formalinfixed, paraffin-embedded tissue samples of the various tissues were mounted on slides, baked in

a dry oven for 1 hour at 60 °C, and deparaffinized. Tissue sections were then pre-treated with
RNAscope H2O2 to block endogenous peroxidases for 10 minutes at room temperature. Target
retrieval was carried out using the RNAscope Target Retrieval Reagent for 15 minutes.
RNAscope Protease Plus Reagent was then applied for 15 minutes at 40 °C. The probes targeting
SARS-CoV-2 RNA (V-nCoV2019-S probe, ref#848561) or anti-genomic RNA (V-nCoV2019S-sense ref#845701) were designed and manufactured by Advanced Cell Diagnostics. The
negative probe was also obtained from Advanced Cell Diagnostics (Reference # 310034). The
stained tissues were counterstained with Gills I Hematoxylin, and the final images were captured
using a light microscope equipped with a digital camera.

SARS-CoV-2 transmission studies
Eight to thirty two-week old female or male deer mice were challenged with 105 or 106 TCID50
of SARS-CoV-2 by an intranasal route (i.n.) of administration in a 50 µl volume. At 24 or 48 hpi
(for 106 TCID50 and 105 TCID50, respectively) experimentally infected deer mice were placed
into a fresh cage with a naïve cage mate to assess direct contact transmission (donor:contacts at
1:1 ratio). Deer mice were monitored daily for clinical signs and/or weight loss. Oropharyngeal
and rectal swab samples were taken on alternate days up to 10 DPI or 14 DPI (for 106 TCID50
and 105 TCID50, respectively), and oropharyngeal and rectal swabs as well as serum samples
were collected at 21 dpc.
Bioinformatic analyses
Ace2 sequences were aligned with Clustal Omega58. For the phylogenetic analysis,
mitochondrial genome sequences (see Accession codes) were aligned with MAFFT v7.46759,
with regions of poor alignment trimmed with Gblocks v0.91b60 resulting in a final alignment of
15,393bp in 115 blocks of minimum 5bp lengths. A maximum likelihood phylogeny was
constructed with RAxML v8.2.1261 using the GTR+I+G4 substitution model as selected by
modeltest-ng62.
Data analysis
Results were analyzed and graphed using Prism 8 software (Graphpad Software). As appropriate,
statistical analyses were performed using ANOVA with multiple comparison correction, the
multiple t test, or the unpaired t test with Welch’s correction or Mann-Whitney test.

Figure 3: Histopathology and virus distribution. Hematoxylin/eosin (H&E) staining (left) and in situ hybridization (ISH) using anti-sense probes that detect the SARS-CoV-2
genome/mRNA (middle) and sense probes that detects anti-genomic RNA (right) were carried out on a) nasal turbinates and b) lung tissue of uninfected and SARS-CoV-2-infected deer
mice (1x105 TCID50 i.n. route) at 2 and 4 dpi. Positive detection of viral genomic RNA/mRNA or anti-genomic RNA is indicated by magenta staining (middle/right panels and insets). Arrows
indicate perivascular infiltrations of histiocytes and neutrophils (black), peribronchiolar infiltrations of histiocytes and neutrophils (orange), mild neutrophilic infiltration in the submucosa
(blue), occasionally observed discrete foci of interstitial pneumonia (purple), occasionally observed multinucleated syncytial cells (magenta), and anti-genomic RNA occasionally in individual
scattered bronchiolar epithelial cells (green and right inset). The magnification is 20x for H&E and 20x for ISH unless otherwise indicated. Scale bars = 100 µm , 50 µm, and 20 µm for 10x,
20x, and 40x, respectively.

Figure 4: Deer mouse host response to SARS-CoV-2 infection. a-e, Hematological levels and serum biochemistry were measured in uninfected and
SARS-CoV-2-infected deer mice (infectious dose 106 TCID50, i.n. route) at 3 dpi, including (a) white blood cell, lymphocyte, and neutrophil counts, (b) the
neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio, (c) alanine aminotransferase (ALT), (d) blood albumin (ALB), and (e) blood urea nitrogen (BUN). f, Cytokine gene
expression was measured for TNFα, IL-6, IL-10, and IFNα in the lungs of SARS-CoV-2-infected deer mice and displayed relative to age-matched
mock-infected animals. Gene expression was normalized using GAPDH as a control. g, IgG antibody response against SARS-CoV-2 mixed spike and
nucleoprotein (S/N) antigens were assessed by ELISA using serum collected on the indicated days post-infection (infectious dose, 105 TCID50). h,
Neutralizing antibody against SARS-CoV-2 was measured by PRNT90 using serum collected at 28 days after SARS-CoV-2 infection (infectious dose, 105
TCID50). Dotted lines indicate the limit of detection. Bars indicate mean, error bars indicate SEM (c-e) or 95% confidence interval (f). (a-b, n = 5/3 for
uninfected/infected; c-e, n = 5/4 for uninfected/infected, f, n = 6, g-h, n = 5 or 6) * = P < 0.05, ns = P > 0.05, Mann-Whitney test (b), unpaired t test (c-e).

Figure 5: Transmission of SARS-CoV-2 between deer mice through direct contact. a-g, Adult male and female deer mice were exposed to 106 TCID50
SARS-CoV-2 by an i.n. route of infection. At 1 dpi individual inoculated donor deer mice were transferred to a new cage and co-housed with a single naïve deer
mouse (1:1 ratio) to assess SARS-CoV-2 transmission by direct contact. Deer mice were either maintained in direct contact throughout the 10 day study for
serial swabbing or humanely euthanized on 2 or 4 days post-contact (dpc) for tissue collection. a-d, Viral RNA levels (a, b) and infectious viral loads (c, d) were
measured in oropharyngeal swabs and rectal swab samples every other day from -1 to 10 days after direct contact was initiated. Oropharyngeal or rectal swab
samples obtained from the same animal are demarcated with a unique colour, and samples derived from co-housed pairs share the same symbol. e-f, An
additional transmission study was carried out in the same manner and nasal wash, nasal turbinates, and lung samples were collected from contact animals at
(e) 2 dpc and (f) 4 dpc. g, IgG antibody response (reciprocal serum dilution) against SARS-CoV-2 S and N in donor and direct-contact exposed animals were
assessed by ELISA using serum collected at 21 dpc. h-i, In an additional study adult male and female deer mice were exposed to 105 TCID50 SARS-CoV-2 by
an intranasal route of infection. At 2 dpi individual inoculated donor deer mice were transferred to a new cage and co-housed with a single naïve deer mouse
(1:1 ratio) to assess SARS-CoV-2 transmission by direct contact (n = 5). Viral RNA levels were measured in (h) oropharyngeal swabs and (i) rectal swab
samples every other day from 0 to 14 days after direct contact was initiated, and final swab samples were collected at 21 dpi and assessed. Dotted or dashed
lines indicate the limit of detection. Bars indicate means. Data were collected from two independent experiments.
