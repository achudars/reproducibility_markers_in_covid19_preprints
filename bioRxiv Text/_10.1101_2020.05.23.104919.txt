ABSTRACT
Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) (2019-nCoV), is a positive-sense, single-stranded
RNA coronavirus. The virus is the causative agent of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) and is contagious
through human-to-human transmission. The present study reports sequence analysis, complete coordinate tertiary
structure prediction and in silico sequence-based and structure-based functional characterization of full SARS-CoV2 proteome based on the NCBI reference sequence NC_045512 (29903 bp ss-RNA) which is identical to GenBank
entry MN908947 and MT415321. The proteome includes 12 major proteins namely orf1ab polyprotein (includes 15
proteins), surface glycoprotein, ORF3a protein, envelope protein, membrane glycoprotein, ORF6 protein, ORF7a
protein, orf7b, ORF8, Nucleocapsid phosphoprotein and ORF10 protein. Each protein of orf1ab polyprotein group
has been studied separately. A total of 25 polypeptides have been analyzed out of which 15 proteins are not yet
having experimental structures and only 10 are having experimental structures with known PDB IDs. Out of 15
newly predicted structures six (6) were predicted using comparative modeling and nine (09) proteins having no

significant similarity with so far available PDB structures were modeled using ab-initio modeling.
Structure verification using recent tools QMEANDisCo 4.0.0 and ProQ3 for global and local (perresidue) quality estimates indicate that the all-atom model of tertiary structure of high quality and may be
useful for structure-based drug designing targets. The study has identified nine major targets (spike protein,
envelop protein, membrane protein, nucleocapsid protein, 2'-O-ribose methyltransferase, endoRNAse, 3'-to-5'
exonuclease, RNA-dependent RNA polymerase and helicase) for which drug design targets could be considered.
There are other 16 nonstructural proteins (NSPs), which may also be percieved from the drug design angle. The
protein structures have been deposited to ModelArchive. Tunnel analysis revealed the presence of large

number of tunnels in NSP3, ORF 6 protein and membrane glycoprotein indicating a large number of
transport pathways for small ligands influencing their reactivity.

Key words: Proteome analysis, orf1ab polyprotein, SARS-CoV-2, 2019-nCoV, tunnel analysis.

INTRODUCTION
Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), is a positive-sense, single-stranded RNA with
genome size 26.2 and 31.7 kb coronavirus, covered by an enveloped structure (Yang et al., 2006), which is a major
source of disaster in the 21th century. The virus is the causative agent of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) and
is contagious through human-to-human transmission. A typical CoV contains at least six ORFs in its genome.
SARS-CoV-2 is the seventh coronavirus that is known to cause human disease. Coronaviruses (CoVs) are a group of
large and enveloped viruses with positive-sense, single-stranded RNA genomes (Lai et al., 2007; Lu and Liu, 2012).
Previously identified human CoVs that cause human disease include the alphaCoVs hCoV-NL63 and hCoV-229E
and the betaCoVs HCoV-OC43, HKU1, severe acute respiratory syndrome CoV (SARS-CoV), and Middle East

respiratory syndrome CoV (MERS-CoV) (Lu et al., 2015). Among these seven strains, three strains proved to be
highly pathogenic (SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV, and 2019-nCoV), which caused endemic of severe CoV disease
(Paules et al., 2020).The viruses can be classified into four genera: alpha, beta, gamma, and deltaCoVs (Woo et al.,
2009). Both alphaCoVs and the betaCoVs HCoV-OC43 and HKU1 cause self-limiting common cold-like illnesses
(Chiu et al., 2005; Jean et al., 2013). However, SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV infection can result in life-threatening
disease and have pandemic potential. SARS-CoV-2 is responsible for the infection with special reference to the
involvement of the respiratory tract (both lower and upper respiratory tract), e.g., common cold, pneumonia,
bronchiolitis, rhinitis, pharyngitis, sinusitis, and other system symptoms such as occasional watery and diarrhea
(Chang et al., 2016; Paules et al., 2020).
The current classification of coronaviruses recognizes 39 species in 27 subgenera, five genera and two
subfamilies that belong to the family Coronaviridae, suborder Cornidovirineae, order Nidovirales and realm
Riboviria (Ziebuhr et al., 2017; Siddell et al., 2019; Ziebuhr et al., 2019) . The family classification and taxonomy
are developed by the Coronaviridae Study Group (CSG), a working group of the ICTV (de Groot et al., 2012). To
accommodate the wide spectrum of clinical presentations and outcomes of infections caused by SARS-CoV-2
(ranging from asymptomatic to severe or even fatal in some cases) (Huang et al., 2020), the WHO recently
introduced a rather unspecific name (coronavirus disease 19, also known as COVID-19 (World Health Organization,
2020) to denote this disease. Whole-genome sequencing results showed that the causative agent was a novel
coronavirus that was initially named 2019-nCoV by the World Health Organization (WHO) (Wu et al., 2020; Zhou
et al., 2020; Zhu et al., 2020). Later, the International Committee on Taxonomy of Viruses (ICTV) officially
designated the virus SARS-CoV-2 (Coronaviridae Study Group of the International Committee on Taxonomy of
Viruses, 2020), although many virologists argue that HCoV-19 is more appropriate (Jiang et al., 2020).
Understanding the complete proteome of SARS-CoV-2 is the need of the hour for the final destination of
drug/medicine. The major structural proteins namely the E and M proteins, which form the viral envelope; the N
protein, which binds to the virus’s RNA genome; and the S protein, which binds to human receptors, may be
significant from the perspectives of drug design and development.. The nonstructural proteins get expressed as two
long polypeptides, which gets chopped up by the virus’s main protease. This group of proteins includes the main
protease (Nsp5) and RNA polymerase (Nsp12) has equal importance for structure based drug designing. In this
regard, the present study reports sequence analysis and structure prediction (both Comparative and ab-initio
modeling) of full SARS-CoV-2 proteome based on the NCBI reference sequence NC_045512 (29903 bp ss-RNA)
which is identical to GenBank entry MN908947 and MT415321 (Table 1).
The viral genome encodes 29 proteins (Nature DOI: 10.1038/s41433-020-0790-7). In the present analysis
25 proteins of NCBI reference sequence NC_045512 (Figure 1) (including 15 proteins of orf1ab) from the proteome
have been analyzed out of which 15 proteins are not yet having experimental structures and 10 are having
experimental structures with known PDB IDs. Out of 15 predicted structures six (6) proteins namely NSP6, Surface
glycoprotein, Envelope protein, ORF7a, ORF8 and Nucleoproteins were predicted using comparative modeling and
nine (09) proteins namely NSP1, NSP2, NSP3, NSP4, ORF3a, Membrane protein, ORF6, ORF7b and ORF10
having no significant similarity with so far available PDB structures were modeled using ab-initio modeling.

MATERIALS AND METHODS
Acquisition and analysis of sequences
The sequence of full SARS-CoV-2 proteome based on the NCBI reference NC_045512 (29903 bp ss-RNA) along
with GenBank entry MN908947 and MT415321 were analyzed (Table 1). A total of 25 proteins from the proteome

Baruah et al., 2020
have been analyzed out of which 15 proteins are not yet having experimental structures based on BLASTp (Altschul
et al., 1997) and FASTA (Pearson, 1991) searches.
Three-dimensional structure prediction (Comparative and ab-initio modeling) : 3D structure predictions were
carried out for fifteen (15) proteins which are without 3D co-ordinate files. BlastP and FASTA searches were
performed independently to know the existing structure from the PDP, for suitable template for Comparative
modeling and to select the proteins for which ab-initio modeling (Table 2). The significance of the BLAST results
was assessed by expect values (e-value) generated by BLAST family of search algorithm and query coverage. Six
(6) proteins namely NSP6, Surface glycoprotein, Envelope protein, ORF7a, ORF8 and Nucleoproteins had been
predicted
following
Modeller9.23 program (Webb and Sali, 2016)
and Baker Rosetta Server
(https://robetta.bakerlab.org/); nine (09) proteins namely NSP1, NSP2, NSP3, NSP4, ORF3a, Membrane protein,
ORF6, ORF7b and ORF10 having no similarity with the available PDB structures, were modeled for ab-initio
following Baker Rosetta Server (https://robetta.bakerlab.org/). The loop regions were modeled using ModLoop
server (Fiser and Sali, 2003). The final 3D structures with complete coordinates had been obtained by optimization
of a molecular probability density function (pdf) of Modeller (Eswar et al., 2006). The molecular pdf for modelling
was optimized with the variable target function procedure in Cartesian space that employed the method of conjugate
gradients and molecular dynamics with simulated annealing (Sali and Blundell, 1993). The computational protein
structures were verified by using Global and local (per-residue) quality estimates using ProQ3, ModFOLD6-TS,
QMEANDisCo 4.0.0 (Haas et al., 2019). After verification, the coordinate files were successfully deposited to
ModelArchive (https://www.modelarchive.org). All the graphic presentations of the 3D structures were prepared
using Chimera version 1.8.1 (Pettersen et al., 2004) and pyMOL 0.97rc (DeLano, 2002).
Proteomics analysis
The proteomics analyses were carried out after ExPASy proteomic tools (https://www.expasy.org/tools). The Data
mining, sequence analyses for physico-chemical parameters of SARS-CoV-2 proteomes were computed using
ProtParam (Gasteiger et al., 2005) and BioEdit. The important calculations for the amino acid composition, atomic
composition, theoretical pI, molecular weight, Formula, extinction coefficients, half-life, instability index, aliphatic
index, hydrophobicity, charge vs. pH were carried out under sequence analysis (Table 3).
The sequence based functional annotation had been carried out for SARS-CoV-2 proteome in the sequence
database,
using
Pfam
(pfam.sanger.ac.uk/-),
GO
(www.geneontology.org/),
KEGG
database
(www.genome.jp/kegg/). ProFunc server (Laskowski et al., 2005) was used to identify the likely

biochemical function of proteins from the predicted 3D structure. Hmmer version 3.3 (Finn et al., 2011), PFam,
PROSITE, PRINTS, ProDom, InterProScan were deployed for functional characterization. MOLE 2.0 (Sehnal et
al., 2013) and Caver Web 1.0 (Stourac et al., 2019) were used for advanced analysis of biomacromolecular
channels. The theoretical structures of the present study are used for tunnels analysis using Caver Web 1.0. The
tunnel bottleneck radius and lengthas have been calculated in Angstrom (Å) and throughput (estimated tunnel
importance) calculated as e-cost, where e is Euler’s number.

transcription and replication of viral RNAs. Predicted functions of SARS-CoV-2 proteome with respective ProFunc
score has been listed in Table 4 (Annexure-I; Supplementary file).
1. Leader protein (NSP1) (PF11501)
Non-structural protein NSP1 (IPR021590) is the N-terminal cleavage product from the viral replicase that mediates
RNA replication and processing (Almeida et al., 2007). ProMotif results revealed that the structure of NSP1 protein
has 2 sheets, 5 beta hairpins,4 beta bulges,7 strands,5 helices,1 helix-helix interacs,22 beta turns and 3 gamma turns
(Figure 3 A). Physicochemical parameter analysis computed that NSP1 has theoretical Isoelectric point (pI) 5.36,
Instability index 28.83, Aliphatic index 89.72 and Grand average of hydropathicity - 0.378 (Table 3).
NSP1 binds to the 40S ribosomal subunit and inhibits translation, and it also induces a template-dependent
endonucleolytic cleavage of host mRNAs (Kamitani et al., 2009). Structurally, NSP1 consists of a mixed
parallel/antiparallel 6-stranded beta barrel with an alpha helix covering one end of the barrel and another helix
alongside the barrel (Almeida et al., 2007). NSP1 also suppresses the host innate immune functions by inhibiting
type I interferon expression and host antiviral signaling pathways (Almeida et al., 2007).
Tunnels analysis results have estimated three tunnels in NSP1. The best tunnel i.e.tunnel-1(blue) with
bottleneck radius 1.9 Å, length 2.9 Å, distance to surface 2.4 Å, curvature 1.2, throughput 0.89 and number of
residues 16 ; The tunnel- 2 (green) with bottleneck radius 1.6 Å, length 7.3 Å, distance to surface 6.2 Å,
curvature 1.2, throughput 0.81 and number of residues 22; The tunnel- 3 (red) with bottleneck radius 1.1 Å, length
8.8 Å, distance to surface 7.3 Å, curvature 1.2, throughput 0.68 and number of residues 17 (Figure 3A).
2. Non-structural protein 2 (NSP2)
ProMotif evaluation demonstrated that the NSP2 has 2 sheets, 2 beta hairpins, 1 beta bulge, 4 strands;
23 helices; 15 helix-helix interacs; 40 beta turns; 10 gamma turns;1 disulphide (Figure 3B). NSP2 has pI at 6.25,
Instability index 36.06, Aliphatic index 88.93 and Grand average of hydropathicity - 0.062 (Table 3). This protein
may play a role in the modulation of host cell survival signaling pathway by interacting with host PHB and PHB2.
Tunnels analysis results have estimated two most active tunnels in NSP2. The tunnel-1(blue) with
bottleneck radius 1.5 Å, length 5.4 Å, distance to surface 4.8 Å, curvature 1.1, throughput 0.82 and number of
residues 19 ; The tunnel- 2 (green) with bottleneck radius 1.1 Å, length 7.2 Å, distance to surface 6.6 Å,
curvature 1.1, throughput 0.65 and number of residues 20 (Figure 3B).
3. Non-structural protein 3 (NSP3)
The structure of NSP3 has 6 sheets, 10 beta hairpins, 6 beta bulges, 23 strands, 139 helices, 130 helix-helix interacs,
169 beta turns, 45 gamma turns, and 6 disulphides after application of ProMotif (Figure 3C). NSP3 with pI 5.56 has
Instability index 36.56, Aliphatic index 86.22 and Grand average of hydropathicity - 0.175 (Table 3).
Biological Process of NSP3 is proteolysis (GO: 0006508) and involves in molecular function such as
single-stranded RNA binding activity (GO: 0003727), cysteine-type peptidase activity (GO: 0008234), RNAdirected 5'-3' RNA polymerase activity (GO: 0003968) and nucleic acid binding (GO: 0003676).

Baruah et al., 2020
A total of 7 tunnels have been estimated in the structure of NSP3. Out of which three are found to be with
high throughput values. The tunnel-1(blue) with bottleneck radius 1.5 Å, length 6.3 Å, distance to surface 5.6 Å,
curvature 1.1, throughput 0.80 and number of residues 15 ; The tunnel- 2 (green) with bottleneck radius 1.7 Å,
length 10.5 Å, distance to surface 8.5 Å, curvature 1.2, throughput 0.72 and number of residues 21; The tunnel- 3
(red) with bottleneck radius 1.4 Å, length 11.1 Å, distance to surface 7.4 Å, curvature 1.5, throughput 0.68 and
number of residues 20 (Figure 3B). (Figure 3C).

4. Non-structural protein 4 (NSP4)
The structure of NSP4 has 5 sheets, 6 beta hairpins, 3 beta bulges, 11 strands, 16 helices, 20 helix-helix interacs, 41
beta turns, 6 gamma turns (Figure 3D). NSP4 has pI at 7.16, Instability index 34.09, Aliphatic index 95.50 and
Grand average of hydropathicity 0.343 (Table 3). NSP4 Participates in the assembly of virally-induced cytoplasmic
double-membrane vesicles necessary for viral replication. This C-terminal domain (InterPro entry IPR032505) is
predominantly alpha-helical, which may be involved in protein-protein interactions (Manolaridis et al., 2009).
Tunnels analysis results have estimated two most active tunnels in NSP 4. The tunnel-1(blue) with
bottleneck radius 1.8 Å, length 1.9 Å, distance to surface 1.8 Å, curvature 1.0, throughput 0.91 and number of
residues 7 ; The tunnel- 2 (green) with bottleneck radius 1.5 Å, length 13.7 Å, distance to surface 9.4 Å,
curvature 1.5, throughput 0.72 and number of residues 21 (Figure 3D).
5. 3C-like protein
Structure of 3C-like proteinase presented 2 sheets, 7 beta hairpins, 7 beta bulges, 13 strands, 8 helices, 9 helix-helix
interacs, 28 beta turns and 2 gamma turns with pI 5.95 as well as Instability index 27.65, Aliphatic index 82.12 and
Grand average of hydropathicity -0.019 (Table 3).
The biological process of 3C-like proteinase is the viral protein processing (GO :0019082). It resembles
Peptidase_C30 (PF05409) family which corresponds to Merops family C30. This polyprotein is a target of drug
cinanserin, acting most likely via inhibition of the 3CL proteinase

identified by deploying both a homology model and the

crystallographic structure of the binding pocket of the enzyme (Cheng et al., 2005).Cinanserin is an inhibitor of the 3C-Like

Proteinase of Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus and Strongly Reduces Virus Replication in vitro
(Lili et al., 2005).
6. Non-structural protein 6 (NSP6)
NSP6 presented 1 sheet, 1 beta hairpin, 2 strands, 14 helices, 31 helix-helix interacs, 9 beta turns, 2 gamma turns
(Figure 3E) along with pI value 9.11 Instability index 22.94, Aliphatic index 111.55 and Grand average of
hydropathicity 0.790 (Table 3). Nsp6 may play a role in the initial induction of autophagosomes from host’s
endoplasmic reticulum.
NS6 can increase the cellular gene synthesis and may induce apoptosis through c-Jun N-terminal kinase
and Caspase-3 mediated stress (Cheng et al., 2015) could modulate host antiviral responses by inhibiting the
synthesis and signalling of interferon-beta (IFN-beta) via two complementary pathways. One involves NS6
interaction with host N-Myc (and STAT) interactor (Nmi) protein inducing its degradation via ubiquitin proteasome
pathway, suppressing Nmi enhanced IFN signalling. The other pathway suppresses the translocation of signal
transducer and activator of transcription 1 (STAT1) and downstream IFN signalling (Cheng et al., 2015).
Tunnels analysis results have estimated two most active tunnels in Nsp 6 out of three tunnels. The tunnel1(blue) with bottleneck radius 1.8 Å, length 7.8 Å, distance to surface 7.1 Å, curvature 1.1, throughput 0.81 and
number of residues 20 ; The tunnel- 2 (green) with bottleneck radius 1.4 Å, length 8.7 Å, distance to surface 7.0 Å,
curvature 1.3, throughput 0.75 and number of residues 20 (Figure 3E).

7. Non-structural protein 7 (NSP7)
NSP7 is predominantly a alpha helical structure with 3 helices, 7 helix-helix interacs and 3 beta turns (PDB ID
7BV1_C). NSP7 has pI 5.18, Instability index 51.97, Aliphatic index 117.35 and Grand average of hydropathicity
0.199 (Table 3). NSP7 may have the function in activating RNA-synthesizing activity and it forms a hexadecamer
with nsp8 that may participate in viral replication by acting as a primase (Xiao et al.,2012) InterPro scan has
predicted its molecular functions as omega peptidase activity (GO :0008242), cysteine-type endopeptidase activity
(GO :0004197) and transferase activity (GO :0016740). NSP 7 belongs to nsp7 (PF08716) has been implicated in

cysteine-type endopeptidase activity (GO :0004197) and omega peptidase activity (GO :0008242).
NSP alone as a monomer structure may not be biologically relevant as it forms a hexadecameric
supercomplex with nsp7 (Xiao et al.,2012). The dimensions of the central channel and positive electrostatic
properties of the cylinder imply that it confers processivity on RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (Zhai et al., 2005).

The NSP 10 (PF09401) involves in biological process - viral genome replication (GO: 0019079) and RNA
binding activity (GO: 0003723), zinc ion binding (GO: 0008270). A cluster of basic residues on the protein surface
suggests a nucleic acid-binding function, interacting selectively and non-covalently with an RNA molecule or a
portion thereof. NSP10 contains two zinc binding motifs and forms two anti-parallel helices which are stacked
against an irregular beta sheet (Joseph et al., 2006). Nsp10 binds to nsp16 through an activation surface area in
nsp10, and the resulting complex exhibits RNA cap (nucleoside-2'-O)-methyltransferase activity.

B and C. The 2'-O-ribose methyltransferase (nsp16) topology matches those of dengue virus NS5 N-terminal
domain and of vaccinia virus VP39 MTases (Chen et al., 2011).
16. Surface glycoprotein (spike glycoprotein)

helices, 29 helix-helix interacs, 76 beta turns, 16 gamma turns and 12 disulphides (Figure 3F). Surface glycoprotein
(Length = 1273 amino acids; Molecular Weight = 141.113kDa) is rich in Leucine (8.48%) and Serine (7.78) %).
Surface glycoprotein has pI 6.32, Instability index 32.86, Aliphatic index 84.67 and Grand average of hydropathicity
-0.077 (Figure 2C; Table 3).
Surface glycoprotein involves in two important biological processes i.e. receptor-mediated virion
attachment to host cell (GO: 0046813) and membrane fusion (GO: 0061025). Spike protein S1 attaches the virion
to the cell membrane by interacting with host receptor, initiating the infection. Binding to human ACE2 and
CLEC4M/DC-SIGNR receptors and internalization of the virus into the endosomes of the host cell induces
conformational changes in the S glycoprotein. Spike protein S2 mediates fusion of the virion and cellular
membrane by acting as a class I viral fusion protein. Spike protein S2' Acts as a viral fusion peptide which is
unmasked following S2 cleavage occurring upon virus endocytosis. It is a part of cellular components viral
envelope (GO: 0019031) and integral component of membrane (GO: 0016021).
The estimated high throughput tunnel-1 (blue) in Surface glycoprotein is with bottleneck radius 1.1 Å,
length 4.9 Å, distance to surface 3.0 Å, curvature 1.7, throughput 0.81 and number of residues 7 (Figure 3F).

17. ORF3a protein

31121.29 Daltons) is rich in Leucine (10.91%), Valine (9.09%), Threonine (8.73%) and Serine (8.00%). ORF3a
protein has theoretical Isoelectric point (pI) 5.55, Instability index 32.96, Aliphatic index 103.42 and Grand average
of hydropathicity 0.275 (Figure 2D; Table 3).
The protein belongs to family Protein 3a, betacoronavirus (IPR024407). Protein 3a encoded by Orf3/3a,
also known as X1, which forms homotetrameric potassium, sodium or calcium sensitive ion channels (viroporin)
and may modulate virus release. It has also been shown to up-regulate expression of fibrinogen subunits FGA, FGB
and FGG in host lung epithelial cells (Shen et al., 2005; Lu et al., 2006).
Tunnels analysis results have estimated three tunnels in ORF3a. The best tunnel i.e.tunnel-1(blue) with
bottleneck radius 2.5 Å, length 5.8 Å, distance to surface 5.1 Å, curvature 1.1, throughput 0.90 and number of
residues 22 ; The tunnel- 2 (green) with bottleneck radius 1.1 Å, length 21.4 Å, distance to surface 18.3 Å,
curvature 1.2, throughput 0.45 and number of residues 38, The tunnel- 3 (red) with bottleneck radius 0.9 Å, length
27.0 Å, distance to surface 22.3 Å, curvature 1.2, throughput 0.37and number of residues 47 (Figure 3G).
3a protein is a pro-apoptosis-inducing protein. It localises to the endoplasmic reticulum (ER)-Golgi
compartment. SARS-CoV causes apoptosis of infected cells through NLRP3 inflammasome activation, as ORF3a is
a potent activator of the signals required for this activation, pro-IL-1beta gene transcription and protein maturation.
This protein also promotes the ubiquitination of apoptosis-associated speck-like protein containing a caspase
recruitment domain (ASC) mediated by its interaction with TNF receptor-associated factor 3 (TRAF3). The
expression of ORF3a induces NF-kappa B activation and up-regulates fibrinogen secretion with the consequent high

cytokine production (Yu et al., 2004; Lu et al., 2006). Another apoptosis mechanism described for this protein is
the activation of the PERK pathway of unfolded protein response (UPR), which causes phosphorylation of
eIF2alpha and leads to reduced translation of cellular proteins as well as the activation of pro-apoptotic downstream
effectors (i.e ATF4, CHOP) (Minakshi et al., 2009).
18. Envelope protein (E protein)
Envelope protein (E protein) has 4 helices, 2 helix-helix interacs and 3 beta turns (Figure 3H). Envelope protein
(Molecular Weight = 8364.59 Daltons) is rich in Leucine (18.67%) and Valine (17.33%). Envelope protein has pI
8.57, Instability index 38.68, Aliphatic index 144.00 and Grand average of hydropathicity 1.128 (Figure 2E; Table
3).
The Envelope protein belongs to family of Envelope small membrane protein, coronavirus (IPR003873)
and Envelope small membrane protein, betacoronavirus (IPR043506). It plays a central role in virus morphogenesis
and assembly. Biological Process of Envelope protein is pore formation by virus in membrane of host cell (GO:
0039707). The estimated high throughput tunnel-1 (blue) in envelope protein is with bottleneck radius 2.4 Å, length
4.2 Å, distance to surface 3.4 Å, curvature 1.2, throughput 0.92 and number of residues 7 (Figure 3H).
E proteins are well conserved among Coronavirus strains. They are small, integral membrane proteins
involved in several aspects of the virus' life cycle, such as assembly, budding, envelope formation, and
pathogenesis (Schoeman and Fielding, 2019). E protein acts as a viroporin by oligomerizing after insertion in host
membranes to create a hydrophilic pore that allows ion transport (Madan et al., 2005; Surya et al., 2015).
SARS-CoV E protein forms a Ca2+ permeable channel in the endoplasmic reticulum Golgi apparatus
intermediate compartment (ERGIC)/Golgi membranes. The E protein ion channel activity alters Ca2+ homeostasis
within cells boosting the activation of the NLRP3 inflammasome, which leads to the overproduction of IL-1beta.
SARS-CoV overstimulates the NF-kappaB inflammatory pathway and interacts with the cellular protein syntenin,
triggering p38 MARK activation. These signalling cascades result in exacerbated inflammation and
immunopathology (Nieto-Torres et al., 2015).
19. Membrane glycoprotein (M protein)
Membrane glycoprotein has 9 helices, 8 helix-helix interacs, 28 beta turns and 11 gamma turns (Figure 3I).
Membrane glycoprotein (Molecular Weight = 25145.16 Daltons) Leucine (15.77%) and Isoleucine (9.01%).
Membrane glycoprotein presented pI 9.51, Instability index 39.14, Aliphatic index 120.86 and Grand average of
hydropathicity 0.446 (Figure 2F; Table 3).
Biological process of M protein is viral life cycle (GO: 0019058) ; includes attachment and entry of the
virus particle, decoding of genome information, translation of viral mRNA by host ribosomes, genome replication,
and assembly and release of viral particles containing the genome.
Out of the four estimated tunnels in Membrane glycoprotein, the two high throughput tunnels are tunnel-1 (green) is
with bottleneck radius 1.7 Å, length 3.9 Å, distance to surface 3.3 Å, curvature 1.2, throughput 0.87 and number of
residues 17; tunnel-2 (red) is with bottleneck radius 1.5 Å, length 7.4 Å, distance to surface 6.4 Å, curvature 1.2,
throughput 0.76 and number of residues 18; (Figure 3I).
M protein is a component of the viral envelope that plays a central role in virus morphogenesis and
assembly via its interactions with other viral proteins. Protein family membership of M protein includes FM
matrix/glycoprotein, coronavirus (IPR002574). This family consists of various coronavirus matrix proteins which
are transmembrane glycoproteins (Armstrong et al., 1984).
The membrane (M) protein is the most abundant structural protein and defines the shape of the viral
envelope. It is also regarded as the central organiser of coronavirus assembly, interacting with all other major

coronaviral structural proteins. M proteins play a critical role in protein-protein interactions (as well as protein-RNA
interactions) since virus-like particle (VLP) formation in many CoVs requires only the M and envelope (E) proteins
for efficient virion assembly (Ujike and Taguch, 2015).
Interaction of spike (S) with M is necessary for retention of S in the ER-Golgi intermediate compartment
(ERGIC)/Golgi complex and its incorporation into new virions, but dispensable for the assembly process. Binding of
M to nucleocapsid (N) proteins stabilises the nucleocapsid (N protein-RNA complex), as well as the internal core of
virions, and, ultimately, promotes completion of viral assembly. Together, M and E protein make up the viral
envelope and their interaction is sufficient for the production and release of virus-like particles (VLPs) (Schoeman
and Fielding, 2019).
20. ORF6 protein
ORF6 protein shows 3 helices, 1 helix-helix interact, 2 beta turns and 1 gamma turn (Figure 3 J). ORF6 protein

Instability index 31.16, Aliphatic index 130.98 and Grand average of hydropathicity 0.233 (Figure 2G; Table 3).
The ORF6 protein belongs to the protein family Non-structural protein NS6, betacoronavirus (IPR022736).
Proteins in this family are typically between 42 to 63 amino acids in length, highly conserved among SARS-related
coronaviruses (Geng et al., 2005).
Tunnels analysis results have shown four tunnels in the structure of ORF6 protin. Two of the mostly throughput
tunnels are tunnel-1(green) with bottleneck radius 1.6 Å, length 12.7 Å, distance to surface 8.7 Å, curvature 1.0,
throughput 0.78 and number of residues 17 ; The tunnel- 2 (red) with bottleneck radius 1.2 Å, length 7.6 Å,
distance to surface 6.6 Å, curvature 1.1, throughput 0.75 and number of residues 12 (Figure 3J).

Structurally it consists of 1 sheet, 2 beta hairpins, 3 strands 5 helices, 4 helix-helix interacs, 8 beta turns, 1 gamma
turn (Figure 3K).ORF7a protein (Molecular Weight = 13743.47 Daltons) is rich in Leucine (12.40%) Threonine
(8.26 %) and Phenylalanine (8.26%). ORF7a protein has shown pI 8.23, Instability index 48.66, Aliphatic index
100.74 and Grand average of hydropathicity 0.318 (Figure 2H; Table 3).
Protein 7a (SARS coronavirus X4 like protein) (Pfam: PF08779 SARS_X4) is a unique type I
transmembrane protein (Nelson et al., 2005). It has been suggested that it has binding activity to integrin I domains
(Hänel et al., 2006). It contains a motif which has been demonstrated to mediate COPII dependent transport out of
the endoplasmic reticulum, and the protein is targeted to the Golgi apparatus (InterPro IPR01488) (Pekosz et al.,
2006).

ORF7b has Protein family membership Non-structural protein 7b, SARS-like (IPR021532) (also known as
accessory protein 7b, NS7B, ORF7b, and 7b) from human SARS coronavirus (SARS-CoV) and similar
betacoronaviruses (Pekosz et al., 2006). It consists of an N-terminal, a C-terminal and a transmembrane domain, the
latter is essential to retain the protein in the Golgi compartment (Schaecher et al., 2007, 2008). Despite it being
named as "non-structural", it has been reported to be a structural component of SARS-CoV virions and an integral
membrane protein (Schaecher et al., 2007).
The estimated high throughput tunnel-1 (blue) in ORF7b protein is with bottleneck radius 1.2 Å, length 3.3 Å,
distance to surface 3.3 Å, curvature 1.0, throughput 0.89 and number of residues 4 (Figure 3L).
23. ORF8 protein

presented pI 5.42, Instability index 45.79, Aliphatic index 97.36 and Grand average of hydropathicity 0.219 (Figure
2J; Table 3).
ORF8 protein belongs to the family Non-structural protein NS8, betacoronavirus (IPR022722).This
family of proteins includes the accessory proteins encoded by the ORF8 in coronaviruses, also known as accessory
protein 8, or non-structural protein 8 (NS8). This is distinct from NSP8, which in encoded on the replicase
polyprotein. This protein has two conserved sequence motifs: EDPCP and INCQ. It may modulate viral
pathogenicity or replication in favour of human adaptation. ORF8 was suggested as one of the relevant genes in the
study of human adaptation of the virus (Keng et al., 2006; Law et al., 2006).
The estimated high throughput tunnel-1 (blue) in ORF 8 protein is with bottleneck radius 1.9 Å, length 1.0 Å,
distance to surface 1.0 Å, curvature 1.0, throughput 0.93 and number of residues 9 (Figure 3M).
24. Nucleocapsid phosphoprotein
Nucleocapsid phosphoprotein has demonstrated 1 sheet, 1 beta hairpin, 2 strands, 30 helices, 27 helix-helix interacs,
31 beta turns, 11 gamma turns (Figure 3N). Nucleocapsid phosphoprotein (Molecular Weight = 45623.27 Daltons)

Aliphatic index 52.53 and Grand average of hydropathicity -0.971 (Figure 2K; Table 3).
The Nucleocapsid SARS-COV-2 (IPR001218) is the member of protein family Nucleocapsid protein,
coronavirus (IPR001218) and Nucleocapsid protein, betacoronavirus (IPR043505). Coronavirus (CoV) nucleocapsid
(N) proteins have 3 highly conserved domains. The N-terminal domain (NTD) (N1b), the C-terminal domain (CTD)
(N2b) and the N3 region. The N1b and N2b domains from SARS CoV, infectious bronchitis virus (IBV), human
CoV 229E and mouse hepatic virus (MHV) display similar topological organisations. N proteins form dimers, which
are asymmetrically arranged into octamers via their N2b domains. The protein is cellular component of viral
nucleocapsid (GO: 0019013).
Tunnels analysis results have estimated three tunnels in Nucleocapsid phosphoprotein. The best tunnel
i.e.tunnel-1(blue) with bottleneck radius 2.0 Å, length 19.6 Å, distance to surface 14.9 Å, curvature 1.3,
throughput 0.70 and number of residues 40 ; The tunnel- 2 (green) with bottleneck radius 1.8 Å, length 25.1 Å,

bottleneck radius 1.3 Å, length 20.0 Å, distance to surface 8.1 Å, curvature 2.5, throughput 0.58 and number of
residues 34 (Figure 3N).
Domains N1b and N2b are linked by another domain N2a that contains an SR-rich region (rich in serine
and arginine residues). A priming phosphorylation of specific serine residues by an as yet unknown kinase, triggers
the subsequent phosphorylation by the host glycogen synthase kinase-3 (GSK-3) of several residues in the SR-rich

region. This phosphorylation allows the N protein to associate with the RNA helicase DDX1 permitting template
read-through, and enabling the transition from discontinuous transcription of sub genomic mRNAs (sgmRNAs) to
continuous synthesis of longer sgmRNAs and genomic RNA (gRNA). Production of gRNA in the presence of N
oligomers may promote the formation of ribonucleoprotein complexes, and the newly transcribed sgmRNA would
guarantee sufficient synthesis of structural proteins (Wu et al., 2014; Cong et al., 2017, 2020).
It has been shown that N proteins interact with nonstructural protein 3 (NSP3) and thus are recruited to the
replication-transcription complexes (RTCs). In MHV, the N1b and N2a domains mediate the binding to NSP3 in a
gRNA-independent manner. At the RTCs, the N protein is required for the stimulation of gRNA replication and
sgmRNA transcription. It remains unclear, however, how and why the N protein orchestrates viral RNA synthesis.
The cytoplasmic N-terminal ubiquitin-like domain of NSP3 and the SR-rich region of the N2a domain of the N
protein may be important for this interaction. The direct association of N protein with RTCs is a critical step for
MHV infection (Cong et al., 2020). Sequence comparison of the N genes of five strains of the coronavirus mouse
hepatitis virus suggests a three domain structure for the nucleocapsid protein (Parker and Masters, 1990).
25. ORF10 protein
Structure wise ORF10 has shown 1 sheet , 1 beta alpha beta unit, 2 strands, 1 helix, 2 beta turns (Figure
3O).ORF10 protein (Molecular Weight = 4449.01 Daltons) is rich in Asperagine (13.16%), Leucine (10.53%), and
Phenylalanine (10.53%) as well as carries pI 7.93, Instability index 16.06, Aliphatic index 107.63 and Grand
average of hydropathicity 0.637 (Figure 2L; Table 3). Protein family membership has not been predicted for ORF 10
protein. The estimated high throughput tunnel-1 (blue) in ORF 10 protein is with bottleneck radius 1.5 Å, length
1.0 Å, distance to surface 1.0 Å, curvature 1.0, throughput 0.89 and number of residues 6 (Figure 3O).
Hetero-Oligomeric Complexes
Nsp7-nsp8 hexadecamer may possibly confer processivity to the polymerase, may be by binding to dsRNA or by
producing primers utilized by the latter. Experimental evidence for SARS-CoV that nsp7 and nsp8 activate and
confer processivity to the RNA-synthesizing activity of Polymerase (Subissi et al., 2014; Kirchdoerfer and Ward,
2019). Nsp10 plays a pivotal role in viral transcription by stimulating nsp14 3'-5' exoribonuclease activity. Nsp10
plays a pivotal role in viral transcription by stimulating nsp16 2'-O-ribose methyltransferase activity. Spike protein
S1 binds to human ACE2, initiating the infection. CoV attaches to the target cells with the help of spike protein–host
cell protein interaction (angiotensin converting enzyme-2 [ACE-2] interaction in SARS-CoV (Li et al., 2003) and
dipeptidyl peptidase-4 [DPP-4] in MERS-CoV (Mubarak et al., 2019). After the receptor recognition, the virus
genome with its nucleocapsid is released into the cytoplasm of the host cells. The viral genome contains ORF1a and
ORF1b genes, which produce two PPs that are pp1a and pp1b (te Velthuis et al., 2016) which help to take command
over host ribosome for their own translation process(Stobart et al., 2013).
The Instability index value of SARS-COV-2 ranged between 16.06 (ORF10 protein) and 51.97 (NSP7),
which classifies ORF10 protein as most stable and NSP7 as most unstable protein. The proteins namely ORF7a
protein (48.66), ORF7b protein (50.96), NSP7 (51.97), ORF 8 protein (45.79) and Nucleocapsid phosphoprotein
(55.09) are unstable as per the instability index. The rest of the proteins are showing stability as per the instability
index (Table 3).Except Nucleocapsid phosphoprotein and ORF10 protein all other proteins of SARS-COV-2 are rich
in Lucine (Figure 2).The aliphatic index of SARS-COV2 ranged between 61.80 (NSP10) and 156.51 (ORF 7b
protein), which indicates most thermostability in ORF 7b protein (Table 3).The Grand average of hydropathicity
(GRAVY) value of NSP4 (0.343), NSP6 (0.790), NSP7 (0.199), ORF3a protein (0.275), Envelpe protein (1.128),
Membrane glycoprotein (0.446), ORF6 protein (0.233), ORF7a protein (0.318), ORF 7b protein (1.449), ORF 8

Baruah et al., 2020
protein (0.219) and ORF10 protein (0.637) indicate that these proteins are hydrophobic in nature. The all other
proteins are hydrophilic (Table 3).
Tunnels are access paths connecting the interior of molecular systems with the surrounding environment.
The presence of tunnels in proteins influences their reactivity, as they determine the nature and intensity of the
interaction that these proteins can take part in (Jaiswal et al., 2012). Tunnel analysis of the newly predicted
structures of the present study have estimated the presence of multiple tunnels in NSP1, NSP3, NSP6, ORF3a
protein, ORF6 protein, membrane glycoprotein, ORF7a protein and Nucleocapsid phosphoprotein. The presence of
multiple tunnels in these proteins may take key role in a large number of transport pathways for small ligands
influencing their reactivity. It has been experimentally demonstrated that the tunnels and their properties can define
many important protein characteristics like substrate specificity, enantioselectivity, stability and activity (Brezovsky
et al., 2016). The detail of the structure verification report has been deposited to Modelarchive and will be

available to download alongwith the structures (https://www.modelarchive.org/doi/10.xxxx/).

CONCLUSION
The RNA genome of SARS-CoV-2 has 29.9 Kb nucleotides, encoding for 29 proteins, though one may not get
expressed. Studying these different components of the virus, as well as how they interact with human cells is already
yielding some clues, but much remains to be explored. The present study reported theoretical modeling of 15
proteins, In- silico sequence-based and structure-based functional characteration of full SARS-CoV-2 proteome
based on the NCBI reference sequence NC_045512 (29903 bp ss-RNA). Presence of large number of tunnels in
NSP1, NSP3, NSP6, ORF3a protein, ORF6 protein, membrane glycoprotein, ORF7a protein and Nucleocapsid
phosphoprotein indicates their high reactivity. The theoretical structures along with statistical verification reports
have been successfully deposited to Model Archive. The 15 theoretical structures would perhaps be useful for the
scientific community for advanced computational analysis on interactions of each protein for detailed functional
analysis of active sites towards structure based drug designing or to study potential vaccines, if at all, towards
preventing epidemics and pandemics in absence of complete experimental structure.
