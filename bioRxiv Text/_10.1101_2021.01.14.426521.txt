Investigation has confirmed that polysaccharide heparan sulfate can bind to the spike

27

protein and block SARS-CoV-2 infection. Theoretically, similar structure of nature

28

polysaccharides may also have the impact on the virus. Indeed, some marine

29

polysaccharide has been reported to inhibit SARS-Cov-2 infection in vitro, however

30

the convinced targets and mechanism are still vague. By high throughput screening to

31

target 3CLpro enzyme, a key enzyme that plays a pivotal role in the viral replication

32

and transcription using nature polysaccharides library, we discover the mixture

33

polysaccharide 375 from seaweed Ecklonia kurome Okam completely block 3CLpro

34

enzymatic activity (IC50, 0.48 µM). Further, the homogeneous polysaccharide 37502

35

from the 375 may bind to 3CLpro molecule well (kD value ： 4.23 × 10-6). Very

36

interestingly, 37502 also can potently disturb spike protein binding to ACE2 receptor

37

(EC50, 2.01 µM ). Importantly, polysaccharide 375 shows good anti-SARS-CoV-2

38

infection activity in cell culture with EC50 values of 27 nM (99.9% inhibiting rate at

39

the concentration of 20 µg/mL ), low toxicity (LD50: 136 mg/Kg on mice). By DEAE

40

ion-exchange chromatography, 37501, 37502 and 37503 polysaccharides are purified

41

from native 375. Bioactivity test show that 37501 and 37503 may impede

42

SARS-Cov-2 infection and virus replication, however their individual impact on the

43

virus is significantly less that of 375. Surprisingly, polysaccharide 37502 has no

44

inhibition effect on SARS-Cov-2. The structure study based on monosaccharide

45

composition, methylation, NMR spectrum analysis suggest that 375 contains

46

guluronic acid, mannuronic acid, mannose, rhamnose, glucouronic acid, galacturonic

47

acid, glucose, galactose, xylose and fucose with ratio of 1.86 : 9.56 : 6.81 : 1.69 :

1.00 : 1.75 : 1.19 : 11.06 : 4.31 : 23.06. However, polysaccharide 37502 is an aginate

49

which composed of mannuronic acid (89.3 %) and guluronic acid (10.7 %), with the

50

molecular weight (Mw) of 27.9 kDa. These results imply that mixture polysaccharides

51

375 works better than the individual polysaccharide on SARS-Cov-2 may be the

52

cocktail-like polysaccharide synergistic function through targeting multiple key

53

molecules implicated in the virus infection and replication. The results also suggest

54

that 375 may be a potential drug candidate against SARS-CoV-2.

Introduction

60

The Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) has

61

made a pandemic of Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) cross the globe. Up to

62

now, this virus has spread more than 200 countries. Around 22 million confirmed

63

infection and 1500,000 have died in the past 6 months and the number is increasing

64

(Dong, Du, & Gardner, 2020). Keeping social distancing is a functional strategy to

65

slow down the infection due to the absence of vaccine or during the coming vaccine

66

injection period and effective medicine. Currently, only one anti-SARS-Cov-2 agent,

67

remdesivir, has been approved by FDA for the treatment of adult COVID-19 patients

68

(Beigel et al., 2020). Scientific research institutions and pharmaceutical companies

69

are trying to understand the mechanism of SARS-CoV-2 infection and potential

70

antivirus drug to treat COVID-19. A chymotrypsin-like cysteine protease called

71

3C-like protease (3CLpro) and papain-like protease (PLpro) are required to process

72

polyproteins into mature nonstructural proteins such as RNA-dependent RNA

73

polymerase (RdRp) and helicase, which are essential for viral transcription and

74

replication (Su et al., 2020). Shailendra K. Saxena, et al, found that SARS-CoV-2 had

75

only 12.8 % of difference with SARS-CoV in S protein and has 83.9 % similarity in

76

minimal receptor-binding domain with SARS-CoV (Kumar, Maurya, Prasad, Bhatt, &

77

Saxena, 2020). In 2003, it had been identified that angiotensin-converting enzyme 2

78

(ACE2) could efficiently bind to the S1 domain of the SARS-CoV S protein (Li et al.,

79

2003). The S protein is a heavily glycosylated protein, which possess 22 potential

80

N-glycosylation sites and facilitates attachment, entry and membrane fusion

81

(Shajahan, Supekar, Gleinich, & Azadi, 2020). Previous researchers showed that

82

several viruses interacted with sialic acids located on the ends of glycans in

83

glycolipids and glycoproteins surrounding the cells. Some other viruses might interact

84

with heparan sulfate (HS) that is attached to cell membrane (Milewska et al., 2014) or

85

extracellular matrix proteoglycans (Lindahl, Couchman, Kimata, & Esko, 2015).

86

Latest research found that SARS-CoV-2 entry the human cell through binding of

87

the virus spike (S) protein to angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) and cellular

88

HS on the surface of the host cell (Clausen et al., 2020). Hence, blocking the viral

89

transcription, replication and interfering the binding of SARS-CoV-2 and human cells

90

targeting the glycan on ACE2 or spike (S) protein are rational strategies to fight

91

SARS-Cov-2 infection. Interestingly, traditional Chinese medicine has been paid

92

more attention for antivirus clinical drug application during SARS-CoV and

93

SARS-CoV-2 spreading (Leung, 2007; H. Luo et al., 2020; Wen et al., 2011). Indeed,

94

Baicalin and baicalein, two ingredients of Chinese traditional patent medicine

95

Shuanghuanglian, were characterized as the first noncovalent, nonpeptidomimetic

96

inhibitors of SARS-COV-2 3CLpro and exhibited potent antiviral activities in a

97

cell-based system (Su et al., 2020) . However, the detailed mechanism underlying

98

active components against

the virus is still vague.

99

Traditional Chinese medicine Ecklonia kurome, named Kunbu in China, is a

100

seaweed of the Laminariaceae, belonging to the genus Laminariales (Kuda, Kunii,

101

Goto, Suzuki, & Yano, 2007). The high pharmaceutical value of this seaweed is at

102

least partially relied on the biomacromolecule polysaccharide. Different from other

103

general polysaccharide, the polysaccharide in Ecklonia kurome is mainly present on

104

cell wall of brown algae plants and has a sulfate group at the end of its molecular

105

chain, which may make it have significance bio-activities (Li et al., 2020). For

106

instance, a modified sulfate polysaccharide extracted from Ecklonia kurome has

107

anti-angiogenesis anti-tumor effect (Kuda et al., 2007). Alginate, a mainly acid

108

polysaccharide

109

β-(1-4)-D-mannuronic acid and of its C-5 epimer, α-(1-4)-L-guluronic acid. They

110

consist of alternate homopolymeric blocks of poly-β-(1-4)-D-mannuronic acid (M),

111

and poly-α-(1-4)-L-guluronic acid (G), and of heteropolymeric blocks with random

112

arrangements of both monomers (Fujihara & Nagumo, 1993). Previous research

113

revealed that alginate had the effect on anti-tumor and immunoenhancement (de

114

Sousa et al., 2007; Luo, Wu, Lou, Zhao, & Yang, 2020), however no anti-virus effect

115

was reported.

116

In this study, we firstly extracted crude polysaccharide, named 375 from

117

Ecklonia kurome and examine the bioactivity against SARS-Cov-2 virus. Then we

118

isolated and purified crude polysaccharide and further characterized the structure of

119

one homogeneous polysaccharide 37502 from Ecklonia kurome. The molecular

120

weight (Mw), monosaccharide composition, infrared spectroscopy (IR) and nuclear

121

magnetic resonance (NMR) spectra were employed to analyze the structure.

122

Eventually, we further examined anti-SARS-CoV-2 bioactivity by targeting 3CL pro,

123

S1 and ACE2 molecules.

showed the existence of heteropolymeric blocks with random arrangements of both

mannuronic acid and guluronic acid.

Putative structure of 37502

224

Based on the above results, we proposed that 37502 is an alginate consisting of

225

different dimer structures (MM, MG, GM and GG). The molar ratio (F) of dimer

226

structures was speculated according to the integral area (I) of a, b, c in 1H-NMR and

227

following formula: FG = Ia/(Ib+Ic), FGG = Ic/(Ib+Ic), FGG +FGM = FG, FMM + FMG = FM,

FMG = FGM. In 1H-NMR of 37502, the integral area of a, b, c was 1.0, 4.85 and 0.55,

229

respectively. So, FG = 0.19; FM = 0.9; FMM = 0.81; FGG = 0.1; FGM = FGM = 0.09. The

230

molar ratio (0.19: 0.9) of between FG and FM was consisted of the results of

231

monosaccharide composition. The ratio of FMM was highest and the ratio of FGG, FMG

232

and FGM was similar. Finally, the possible structure of 37502 (Mw: 27.9 kDa) was

233

shown in Fig. 6.

al., 2020). ORF1a encodes two cysteine proteases, a papain-like protease (PLpro) and

241

a 3 C-like protease (3CLpro). Scientists have provided evidences that main protease

242

(3CLpro) is one of the good targets to discover new antiviral agents before vaccines

243

are available (Derosa, Maffioli, D'Angelo, & Di Pierro, 2020). To explore more potent

244

leading compound against SARS-Cov-2 by targeting key molecule in RNA synthesis

245

of the virus, recombinant SARS-CoV-2 3CLpro was firstly expressed and purified

246

from Escherichia coli (Xue et al., 2007; Yang et al., 2003). A fluorescently labeled

247

substrate MCA-AVLQSGFR-Lys (Dnp) -Lys-NH2, derived from the N-terminal

248

autocleavage sequence from the viral protease was designed and synthesized for the

249

enzymatic assay. Then the binding test targeting 3CLpro was examined. The results

250

showed that 375 might potently inhibit SARS-CoV-2 3CLpro activity (Fig. 7). Further

251

we used a fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET) based cleavage assay to

252

determine the median inhibitory concentration (IC50) values. The results also revealed

253

good inhibitory potency, with IC

254

375 may contain the bioactive components to inhibit SARS-CoV-2 replication and

255

infection. Based on fact that 375 is a crude polysaccharide, the results inspire us to

256

explore which bioactive components from crude polysaccharide 375 may contribute

257

the effect against SARS-Cov-2 and their underlying mechanism.

37502 may bind to SARS-CoV-2 3CLpro and disturb the interaction between

261

SARS-CoV-2-S1 and ACE2

262

To explore which compound from 375 may interfere with 3CLpro enzyme activity,

263

isothermal titration calorimetry (ITC) method was employed (Su et al., 2020). Result

264

showed that. 37502, one homogeneous polysaccharide from 375 could bind to

265

SARS-CoV-2 3CLpro protein very well (Fig. 8A). The Kd value was 4.23 × 10-6 M

266

(Fig. 8A). This result suggested that 375 or 37502 might interfere with the replication

267

of SARS-CoV-2 in some way.

268

The spike protein of SARS-CoV-2 shows more than 90% amino acid similarity to

269

that of pangolin and bat CoVs which also use human angiotensin-convert enzyme 2

270

(ACE2) as a receptor for the virus infection. Receptor binding domain of S protein of

271

SARS-CoV-2 which are processed into two subunits including S1 and S2, can bind

272

with ACE2 as a receptor to invade target cells (Lan et al., 2020). Thus, S protein is

273

very vital for viral invasion. Interestingly, the N-terminal domain of S1 protein has the

274

glycan binding site (Kirchdoerfer et al., 2016). This implies S protein can bind with

275

carbohydrate. To further understand the bioactivity of 375 against SARS-Cov-2,

276

purified homogeneous polysaccharide 37502 from 375 was employed to examine

277

whether it might disturb the binding between S1 protein and ACE2 by ELISA method.

278

The results showed that polysaccharide 37502 could effectively impede the binding of

279

S1 protein with ACE2. The median inhibitory concentration (IC50) was 56.06 µg/mL

280

(Fig. 8B). This result suggested that 37502 might had the potential to block

281

SARS-Cov-2 infection through disturbing the S protein binding to ACE2 receptor.

375 and 37503 exhibit anti-viral effect on SARS-CoV-2

288

The above results inspired us to explore whether those polysaccharides might really

289

block SARS-Cov-2 replication. Firstly, the inhibition effect of native polysaccharide

290

375 was examined. Surprisingly, as shown in Fig. 9A, polysaccharides 375 potently

291

inhibit SARS-Cov-2 in vitro with a EC50 value about 27 nM (or 1.56 µg/mL) (Fig.

bioRxiv preprint doi: https://doi.org/10.1101/2021.01.14.426521; this version posted January 15, 2021. The copyright holder for this

292

9A). However, the toxicity of 375 on mice is low and the LD50 is 136 mg/kg (Table

293

S1, Supplementary Data). To further understand which component from native

294

polysaccharide 375 is contributing to inhibit effect on SARS-Cov-2, quantitative

295

real-time polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR) was also employed to monitor the

296

antiviral activity of the purified polysaccharide 37501, 37502 and 37503 from 375.

297

The result showed that polysaccharide 37501 and 37503 exhibited antivirus effect on

298

SARS-CoV-2 (Fig. 9B). Although 37502 might attenuate 3CLpro enzymatic activity

299

significantly (Fig. 8A), it had no significant direct effect against the active virus

300

replication (Fig. 9B). To examine whether purified polysaccharide 37503 have

301

stronger bioactivity than that of native polysaccharide 375, EC50 of 37503 against

302

SARS-Cov-2 was also measured. Interestingly, effect of 37503 is significant feeble

303

than that of 375, while EC50 of 37503 is 0.89 µM (or 11.07 µg/mL) (Fig. 9C). This

304

indicated the effects of 375 against SARS-Cov-2 were cocktail-like synergistic

305

contribution of combined components of 37501, 37502, and 37503, the impact of

306

individual homogeneous polysaccharide might be weaker although. In brief, although

307

polysaccharide 375 and 37503 are probably the potential drug candidate for inhibiting

308

the SARS-CoV-2 infection, obviously cocktail-liked crude polysaccharide 375 is the

309

best option for anti-SARS-Cov-2 new drug development. Following, we will focus on

310

375 and 37503 for further investigation.

Homogeneous polysaccharide preparation

334

Crude polysaccharide was fractionated on a DEAE Sepharose Fast Flow column.

335

200 mg polysaccharide was dissolved in 20 mL distilled water and centrifuged for

336

each time. The supernatant was applied to a DEAE Sepharose Fast Flow column and

337

eluted with distilled water, 0.05, 0.1, 0.2 and 0.3 M NaCl solutions stepwise. The

338

solution was pooled according to the elution profile based on phenol-sulfuric acid

339

method. Then the fraction eluted with distilled water, 0.2 M NaCl and 0.3 M NaCl

340

were collected, followed by concentration, dialysis with distill water and freeze-dried.

353

FT-IR spectrum and NMR analysis

354

The IR spectra was determined according to the previous report (Cong, Xiao,

355

Liao, Dong, & Ding, 2014). 2 mg native polysaccharide was mixed with dried KBr

356

powder and pressed into pellet, then scanned from 4,000 to 600 cm-1 for the analysis.

357

For the NMR analysis, 30 mg of the sample was deuterium-exchanged and

358

dissolved in 0.5 mL D2O. The 1HNMR,

CNMR, 1H-1H COSY, HSQC and HMBC

359

were measured at 25 °C with acetone as internal standard (δC = 31.5, δH = 2.29). NMR

363

10 mg sample was methylated with a modified method from Ciucanu and Kerek.

364

Briefly, the sample was dried overnight with P2O5 and dissolved in DMSO (2 mL) and

365

100 mg powdered NaOH was added into the reaction bulb and stirred at room

366

temperature for 3 h. Iodomethane (0.5 mL) was added dropwise within 45 min in

367

ice-cold water bath. The mixture was stirred for 2.5 h at room temperature in a dark

368

place and then 1 ml deionized water was added to terminate the reaction. The

369

redundant CH3I was removed by evaporation under depressed pressure. The solution

370

was extracted by 15 ml CHCl3 and 15 ml water (1:1, v/v) and the organic phase was

371

washed with deionized water for three times. After removing the residual water by

372

adding Na2SO4, the organic phase was concentrated to get the methylated

373

polysaccharide. Then the product was hydrolyzed with 2 M TFA for 2 h at 110 °C and

converted into the partially methylated alditol acetates (PMAA) and analyzed by

375

GC-MS. The GC-MS program designed for methylation analysis was based on the

376

reported method (Cong et al., 2014).

377

Uronic acid reduction

378

The method was based on the reported method (Taylor & Conrad, 1972). In brief,

379

40 mg polysaccharide was dissolved in 40 mL H2O. CMC (600 mg) was added and

380

pH was kept at 4.75 with 0.01 M HCl for 2 h. Then 2 M fresh aqueous sodium

381

borohydride (15 mL) was added slowly to the mixture in 45 min and 4 M HCl was

382

added concurrently to keep pH at 7.0. The mixture was stirred for 2 h and dialyzed

383

(1,000 mL × 4) for 24 h at room temperature. Then the retentate was lyophilized to

384

achieve carboxyl reduced polysaccharide, followed by monosaccharide composition

385

and linkage pattern analyses.

386

Enzymatic activity and inhibition assays

387

The enzyme activity and inhibition assays have been described previously (Xue

388

et al., 2007; Yang et al., 2005) . The recombinant SARS-CoV-2 3CLpro (30 nM at a

389

final concentration) was mixed with serial dilutions of each compound in 80 µL assay

390

buffer (50 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.3, 1 mM EDTA) and incubated for 10 min. The

391

reaction was initiated by adding 40 µL fluorogenic substrate with a final concentration

392

of 20 µM. After that, the fluorescence signal at 320 nm (excitation)/405 nm (emission)

393

was immediately measured every 30 s for 10 min with a Bio-Tek Synergy4 plate

394

reader. The Vmax of reactions added with compounds at various concentrations

395

compared to the reaction added with DMSO were calculated and used to generate IC50

396

curves. For polysaccharide 375, IC50 values against SARS-CoV-2 3CLpro were

397

measured at 7 concentrations and three independent experiments were performed. All

398

experimental data was analyzed using GraphPad Prism software.

ELISA

400

10 µg/mL ACE2 coating buffer were used to treat the 96 well plate at 4 °C

401

overnight following with 200 µL washing buffer for three times. Then the 96-well

402

plate was blocked by 2% BSA at room temperature for 2 h. After that, 100 µL

403

biotinylated S1 protein was added and incubated at room temperature. At the same

404

time, the positive control and the negative control were set. After incubation for 1 h,

405

the plate was washing for three times and each time for 5 min. Following, 100 µL

406

Streptavidin-HRP was added to final concentration of 200 ng/mL at room temperature

407

and incubated for 1 h. After 1 h incubation, the plate was washed for three times.

408

Then, 100 µL TMB were added and incubated in the dark for 35 min. Finally, 50 µL

409

stop solution were added to stop the reaction and detected the A450 value number by

410

microplate reader (BioTek).

413

conducted with an iTC200 instrument (Microcal, GE Healthcare) at 25 °C, and the

414

resulting data were processed by the supplied MicroCal Origin software package. The

415

concentration of 3CLpro protein used was 600 µM and polysaccharide 37502 used

416

was 300 µM. Titrations were run in triplicate to ensure reproducibility. In all the cases,

417

a single binding site mode was employed and a nonlinear least-squares algorithm was
