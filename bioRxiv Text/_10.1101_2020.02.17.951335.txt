Abstract:
The outbreak of 2019-nCoV in the central Chinese city of Wuhan at the end of 2019
poses unprecedent public health challenges to both China and the rest world1. The
new coronavirus shares high sequence identity to SARS-CoV and a newly identified
bat coronavirus2. While bats may be the reservoir host for various coronaviruses,
whether 2019-nCoV has other hosts is still ambiguous. In this study, one coronavirus
isolated from Malayan pangolins showed 100%, 98.2%, 96.7% and 90.4% amino acid
identity with 2019-nCoV in the E, M, N and S genes, respectively. In particular, the
receptor-binding domain of the S protein of the Pangolin-CoV is virtually identical to
that of 2019-nCoV, with one amino acid difference. Comparison of available genomes
suggests 2019-nCoV might have originated from the recombination of a
Pangolin-CoV-like virus with a Bat-CoV-RaTG13-like virus. Infected pangolins
showed clinical signs and histopathological changes, and the circulating antibodies
reacted with the S protein of 2019-nCoV. The isolation of a coronavirus that is highly
related to 2019-nCoV in the pangolins suggests that these animals have the potential
to act as the intermediate host of 2019-nCoV. The newly identified coronavirus in the
most-trafficked mammal could represent a continuous threat to public health if
wildlife trade is not effectively controlled.

The ongoing COVID-19 outbreak has posed great threat to global public health
and caused tremendous economic losses3. The virus involved, SARS-CoV-2 (referred
in the report subsequently as 2019-nCoV), is one of the three zoonotic coronaviruses
(the other two are SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV) infecting the lower respiratory tract
and causing severe respiratory syndromes in humans4,5. The 2019-nCoV virus was
first detected in Wuhan, central China. With the migration of population during the
Chinese New Year period, it spreads rapidly from Wuhan to all provinces of China
and a few other countries. It has been more contagious but less deadly than
SARS-CoV thus far, with the total number of human infections far exceeding that
caused by SARS-CoV.
2019-nCoV has about 86.9-88% overall genome sequence similarity to
SARS-CoV and bat SARS-related coronaviruses (SARSr-CoV), and clusters with
them in phylogenetic analyses of genomic sequences1,6. In addition, a bat coronavirus
(Bat SARr-CoV RaTG13) with ~96% sequence identity to 2019-nCoV at the
whole-genome level was reported recently2. Therefore, it is reasonable to assume that
bats are the native host of 2019-nCoV, as previously suggested for SARS-CoVs and
MERS-CoVs7,8. However, without an intermediate host, bat-derived CoVs rarely
infect humans directly. As the outbreak started in December in a big city, hibernating
bats were unlikely the direct cause of the epidemic. This raises concerns that whether
other hosts of 2019-nCoVs exist and transmitted virus to humans, just like during the
SARS and MERS outbreaks.
As coronaviruses are common in mammals and birds9, we used the whole

genome sequence of 2019-nCoV (WHCV; GenBank accession No. MN908947) in a
Blast search of SARS-like CoV sequences in all available mammalian and avian
viromic, metagenomic, and transcriptomic data. This led to the identification of 34
highly related contigs in a set of pangolin viral metagenomes (Table S1). Therefore,
we have focused our subsequent search of SARSr-CoV in this wild animal.
We obtained the lung tissues from four Chinese pangolins (Manis pentadactyla)
and 25 Malayan pangolins (Manis javanica) that were collected from a wildlife rescue
center during March-December 2019, and analyzed for SARSr-CoV using RT-PCR
with primers targeting a conservative region of β CoV. RNA from 17 of the 25
Malayan pangolins generated the expected PCR product, while RNA from the
Chinese pangolins failed to amplify. In the analysis of plasma samples from eight of
the Malayan pangolins using a double-antigen sandwich ELISA designed for the
detection of IgG and IgM antibodies against with 2019-nCoV, one sample reacted
strongly with an OD450 value of 2.12 (cutoff value: 0.11). The plasma remained
positive at the dilution of 1:80, suggesting that the pangolin was naturally infected a
2019-nCoV-like

virus.

histopathological examinations of tissues from four β CoV-positive pangolins
revealed the occurrence of interstitial pneumonia in the lung and severe congestion
and infiltration of inflammatory cells in the liver, kidney, lymph node, and other
organs. Minor hemorrhage was seen in alveolar ducts of the lung and epithelial
surface of the bladder (Fig 1 and Fig S1).
To isolate the virus, supernatant from homogenized lung tissue from one dead

animal was inoculated into Vero E6 cells. Clear cytopathogenic effects were observed
in cells after 72 hours incubation. Viral particles were detected by transmission
electron microscopy mostly inside double-membrane vesicles, with a few outside
them. They showed the typical coronavirus morphology (Fig 1). RT-PCR analysis of
the viral culture using five sets of primers targeting the spike (S) and RdRp genes
produced the expected PCR products in three of them (Fig S2). The PCR products had
~84.5% and 92.2% nucleotide sequence identity to the partial S and RdRp genes of
2019-nCoV, respectively (Fig S3).
Illumina RNAseq was used to identify virus in the lung from nine pangolins. The
mapping of sequence data to the reference 2019-nCoV (WHCV) genome identified
CoV sequence reads in seven samples (Table S2). By de novo assembly and targeted
PCR, one nearly completed CoV genomes (29,578 Bp) was obtained, and was
designated as Pangolin-CoV. The predicted S, E, M and N genes of pangolin-CoV are
3,798, 228, 669 and 1,260 bp in length, respectively, and share 90.4%, 100%, 98.2%
and 96.7% amino acid identity to 2019-nCoV (Table 1). In a Simplot analysis of
whole genome sequences, the Pangolin-CoV genome was highly similar throughout
the genome to 2019-nCoV and Bat SARSr-CoV RaTG13, with sequence identity
between 80 and 98%, except for the S gene (Fig. 2). Further comparative analysis of
the S gene sequences suggests that there were recombination events among some of
the SARSr-CoV analyzed. In the region of nucleotides 1-914, Pangolin-CoV is more
similar to Bat SARSr-CoV ZXC21 and Bat SARSr-CoV ZC45, while in remaining
part of the gene, Pangolin-CoV is more similar to 2019-nCoV-like and

Bat-CoV-RaTG13 (Fig. 2). In particular, the receptor-binding domain (RBD) of the S
protein of Pangolin-CoV has only one amino acid difference from that of 2019-nCoV.
Overall, these data indicate that 2019-nCoV might have originated from the
recombination of a Pangolin-CoV-like virus with a Bat-CoV-RaTG13-like virus (Fig
2). To further support this conclusion, we assessed the evolutionary relationships
among β coronaviruses in the full genome, RdRp and S genes, and different regions of
the S gene (Fig 3). The topologies mostly showed clustering of Pangolin-CoV with
2019-nCoV and Bat SARSr-CoV RaTG13, with 2019-nCoV and Bat SARSr-CoV
RaTG13 forming a subclade within the cluster (Fig 3). In the phylogenetic analysis of
RBD region of the S gene, however, Pangolin-CoV and 2019-nCoV grouped together.
Conflicts in cluster formation among phylogenetic analyses of different regions of the
genome serve as a strong indication of genetic recombination, as previously seen in
SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV5,10.
As the S proteins of both SARS-CoV and 2019-nCoV have been shown to
specifically recognize angiotensin converting enzyme II (ACE2) during the entry of
host cells2,11, we conducted a comparative analysis of the interaction of the S proteins
of the four closely related SARSr-CoV viruses with ACE2 proteins from humans,
civets and pangolins. As expected, the RBD of the S protein of SARS-CoV bands
ACE2 from humans and civets efficiently. In addition, it appears to be capable of
binding ACE2 of pangolins. This is also the case for the Bat-CoV-RaTG13. In
contrast, the S proteins of 2019-nCoV and Pangolin-CoV can potentially recognize
ACE2 of only humans and pangolins. Therefore, ACE2 proteins of humans and

pangolins can probably recognize the S proteins of all four SARSr-CoV viruses, while
the ACE2 of civets can probably only recognize the S proteins of SARS-CoV and
Bat-CoV-RaTG13 (Fig 4).
Epidemiological investigations of the 2019-nCoV outbreak showed that the initial
patients were associated with the Huanan Seafood Market, where live wildlife was
also sold12. Although the 2019-nCoV virus was detected in some environment
samples from the market, no animals thus far have been implicated as carriers of the
virus. The SARSr-CoV virus identified in pangolins in the present study is genetically
related to 2019-nCoV, but is unlikely directly linked to the outbreak because of the
substantial sequence differences between 2019-nCoV and Pangolin-CoV. A virus
related to Pangolin-CoV, however, appears to have donated the RBD of the S protein
to 2019-nCoV. SARSr-CoV sequences were previously detected in dead Malayan
pangolins13. These sequences appear to be from Pangolin-CoV identified in the
present study judged by their sequence similarity. In the present study, we have
provided virological, serological and histopathological evidence for the virulence of
Pangolin-CoV and the potential pangolins

as the zoonotic reservoir of

2019-nCoV-like coronaviruses. In addition, as the RBD of pangolin-CoV is virtually
identical to that of 2019-nCoV, and has strong binding ability to human ACE2,
Pangolin-CoV presents a potential future threat to public health. The broad binding
range of pangolin ACE2 to RBD of S proteins reaffirms the potential of pangolins as
the intermediate host of SARSr-CoV. Pangolins and bats are both nocturnal animals,
eat insects, and share overlapping ecological niches, which make pangolins the ideal

intermediate host for some SARSr-CoV. Therefore, more systematic and long-term
monitoring of other SARSr-CoV in pangolins and other related animals should be
implemented to identify the potential animal source of 2019-nCoV in the current
outbreak.
Findings in the study support the call for stronger ban of illegal pangolin trade.
Due to the insatiable demand for their meat as a delicacy and scales for use in
traditional medicine in China, Chinese pangolins are on the verge of extinction
(http://www.iucnredlist.org/details/12764/0). The illegal smuggling of other pangolins
from Southeast Asia to China is rampant14,15. Almost all pangolins in the illegal game
market are Malayan pangolins, and the customs confiscates a large number of
Malayan pangolins every year. International co-operation and stricter regulations
against illegal wildlife trade and consumption of game meat should be implemented.
They can offer stronger protection of endangered animals as well as the prevention of
major outbreaks caused by SARSr-CoV.

Materials and methods
Metagenomic analysis and viral Genome assembly
We collected viromic, metagenomic, and transcriptomic data of different
mammals and birds in public databases, including NCBI Sequence Read Archive
(SRA) and European Nucleotide Archive (ENA), for searching potential coronavirus
sequences. The raw reads from the public databases and some inhouse metagenomic
datasets were firstly trimmed using fastp (v0.19.7)16 to remove adaptor and
low-quality sequences. The clean reads were mapped to the 2019-nCoV reference
sequence (MN908947) using BWA-MEM (v0.7.17)17 with > 30% matches. The
mapped reads were harvested for downstream analysis. Contigs were de novo
assembled using Megahit (v1.0.3)18 and identified as 2019-nCoV-related using
BLASTn with Evalues < 1e5 and sequence identity > 90%.
Samples
Pangolins used in the study were confiscated by Customs and Department of
Forestry of Guangdong Province in March-December 2019. They include four
Chinese pangolins (Manis pentadactyla) and 25 Malayan pangolins (Manis javanica).
These animals were sent to the wildlife rescue center, and were mostly inactive and
sobbing, and eventually died in custody despite exhausting rescue efforts. Tissue
samples were taken from the lung, lymph nodes, liver, spleen, muscle, kidney, and
other tissues from pangolins that had just died for histopathological and virological
examinations.
Histopathology

Histopathological examinations were performed on tissue samples from five
pangolins. Briefly, lung and other tissues collected were cut into small pieces and
fixed in 10% buffered formalin for 24 hrs. They were washed free of formalin,
dehydrated in ascending grades of ethanol for one hour each, and cleared twice in
chloroform for 1½ hours. After being embedded three times with molten paraffin wax
at 58°C in a template, the tissue blocks were sectioned with a microtome at 3-μm
thickness. The sections were spread on warm water bath (42°C) and transferred onto
grease-free glass slides. The slides were air-dried, deparaffinized, and rehydrated
through descending grades of ethanol and distilled water for five min each. They were
stained with a hematoxylin and eosin staining kit (Baso Diagnostics Inc., Wuhan
Servicebio Technology Co., Ltd.) following recommended procedures. Finally, the
stained slides were mounted with coverslip and examined under an Olympus BX53
equipped with an Olympus PM-C 35 camera.

Virus isolation and RT-PCR analysis
Lung tissue extact from pangolins was inoculated into Vero E6 cells for virus
isolation. The cell line was tested free of mycoplasma contamination using
LookOut Mycoplasma PCR Detection Kit (SIGMA). Cultured cell monolayers were
maintained in Dulbecco's Modified Eagle Medium (DMEM) /Ham's F-12. The
inoculum was prepared by grounding the lung tissue in liquid nitrogen, diluting it 1:2
with DMEM, filtered through a 0.45 μm filter (Merck Millipore), and treated with 16

μg/ml trypsin solution. After incubation at 37 for 1 hour, the inoculum was removed

Transmission Electron Microscopy
Cell cultures that showed cytopathic effects were examined for the viral particles

centrifugation at 1,000× g for 10 min, and fixed initially with 2.5% glutaraldehyde
solution at 4  for 4 hours, and again with 1% osmium tetroxide. They were
dehydrated with graded ethanol and embedded with PON812 resin. Sections (80 nm
in thickness) were cut from the resin block and stained with uranyl acetate and lead
citrate sequentially. The negative stained grids and ultrathin sections were observed
under a HT7800 transmission electron microscope (Hitach).

2019-nCoV by Hotgen (Beijing, China), following manufacturer-recommended
procedures. In the assay, the coating antigen was S1 protein expressed in eukaryotic
cell, and the labeled one was the RBD region of the S protein. The reaction was read
on a Synergy HTX Multi-Mode Microplate Reader (BioTek, USA). Positive samples
were tested again with serial diluted plasma.

Metagenomic sequencing
The lung tissue was homogenized by vortexing with silica beads in 1 mL of
phosphate-buffered saline. The homogenate was centrifuged at 10,000× g for 5 min
and the supernatant was filtered through a 0.45 μm filter (Merck Millipore) to remove
large particles. The filtrate or virus culture supernatant was used in RNA extraction
with the QIAamp® Viral RNA Mini kit. cDNA was synthesize from the extracted
RNA using PrimeScriptScript II reverse transcriptase (Takara) and random primers,
and amplified using Klenow Fragment (New England Biolabs). Libraries were
prepared with NEBNext® Ultra™ DNA Library Prep Kit for Illumina® (New England
Biolabs). Paired-end (150-bp) sequencing was performed on an Illumina NovaSeq
6000. Specific PCR assays were used to fill genome sequence gaps, using primers
designed based on sequences flanking the gap.
Phylogenetic analysis
Multiple sequence alignment of all sequence data was done using MAFFT v7.22119.
The phylogenetic relationship of the samples was constructed using RAxML v.8.0.14

using ModelTest21. Potential recombination events and the location of possible
breakpoints in β coronavirus genomes were detected using Simplot (version 3.5.1)22
and RDP 4.9923.

Molecular simulation of interactions between RBD and ACE2
The interaction between the RBD of the S protein of SARSr-CoV and ACE2 of
humans, civets, and pangolins was examined using molecular dynamic simulation.
The crystal structure of SARS-CoV RBD domain binding to human ACE2 protein
complex was download from Protein Data Bank (PDB entry: 2AJF24). The structures
of the complexes formed by ACE2 of civets or pangolins and RBD of 2019-nCoV,
Bat-CoV, and Pangolin-CoV constructed using the homology modeling approach on
the Swiss-model server25, and superimposed with the template (PDB: 2AJF). The
sequence identity of SARS-CoV RBD (PDB: 6ACD) to RBD of 2019-nCoV,
Bat-CoV and Pangolin-CoV was 76.47%, 76.79% and 74.19%, respectively, while the
sequence of ACE2 protein of humans to that of pangolins and civets was 85.40% and
86.93%, respectively.
The molecular dynamic simulations on all RBD-ACE2 complexes were carried
out using the AMBER 18 suite26 and The ff14SB force field 27 as previously described

(Liu et al., 2018). After two stage minimization, NVT and NPT-MD, a 10-ns
production MD simulation was applied, with the time step being set to 2fs and
coordinate trajectories being saved every 1ps. The MM-GBSA28 approach was used
to calculate the binding free energy of each ACE2 protein to the RBD of CoV

AMBER 18 suite. The last 300 frames of all simulations were extracted to calculate
the binding free energy that excludes the contributions of disulfide bond. The free
energy decomposition method30 was used to identify and quantify the key residues
that are involved in the interaction between host ACE2 and viral S proteins.

Fig 1. Histopathological (A-D) and virological (E) examinations of the lung tissues
from an ill Malayan pangolin naturally infected with Pangolin-CoV (A and B, 200×
and 400×, respectively) and an uninfected Malayan pangolin (C and D, 200× and
400×, respectively). Interstitial pneumonia with extensive infiltration of inflammatory
cells is seen in the lung tissue from the infected pangolin. Viral particles are seen in
double-membrane vesicles in the transmission electron microscopy image (small scale
= 50 nm) taken from the Verno E6 cell culture inoculated with supernatant of
homogenized lung (E), with morphology indicative of coronavirus (inserts at the
upper right corner of E).

Fig 2. Similarity plot of the near full-length genome sequence (A) and S gene
sequence (B) of Pangolin-CoV to sequences of 2019-nCoV_WIV02, Bat-CoV
RaTG13, Bat-CoV ZC45 and Bat-CoV ZXC21. While Pangolin-CoV has a high
sequence identity to 2019-nCoV and Bat-CoV-RaTG13 in most regions of the S gene,
it is more similar to Bat SARSr-CoV ZXC21 and Bat SARSr-CoV ZC45 at the 5′ end
(B). More importantly, Pangolin-CoV is highly similar to 2019-nCoV in the
functional RBD region of the S protein, with only one amino difference (insert in B).
Because of the presence of genetic recombination, there is a discrepancy in cluster
formation among the outcomes of phylogenetic analyses of different regions of the S
gene (C).
