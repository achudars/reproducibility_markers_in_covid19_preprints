The spike S of SARS-CoV-2 recognizes ACE2 on the host cell membrane to initiate entry. Soluble decoy
receptors, in which the ACE2 ectodomain is engineered to block S with high affinity, potently neutralize
infection and, due to close similarity with the natural receptor, hold out the promise of being broadly
active against virus variants without opportunity for escape. Here, we directly test this hypothesis. We
find an engineered decoy receptor, sACE22.v2.4, tightly binds S of SARS-associated viruses from
humans and bats, despite the ACE2-binding surface being a region of high diversity. Saturation
mutagenesis of the receptor-binding domain (RBD) followed by in vitro selection, with wild type ACE2
and the engineered decoy competing for binding sites, failed to find S mutants that discriminate in favor
of the wild type receptor. Variant N501Y in the RBD, which has emerged in a rapidly spreading lineage
(B.1.1.7) in England, enhances affinity for wild type ACE2 20-fold but remains tightly bound to
engineered sACE22.v2.4. We conclude that resistance to engineered decoys will be rare and that decoys
may be active against future outbreaks of SARS-associated betacoronaviruses.

Zoonotic coronaviruses have crossed over from animal reservoirs multiple times in the past two
decades, and it is almost certain that wild animals will continue to be a source of devastating outbreaks.
Unlike ubiquitous human coronaviruses responsible for common respiratory illnesses, these zoonotic
coronaviruses with pandemic potential cause serious and complex diseases, in part due to their tissue
tropisms driven by receptor usage. Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronaviruses 1 (SARS-CoV-1)
and 2 (SARS-CoV-2) engage angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) for cell attachment and entry (17). ACE2 is a protease responsible for regulating blood volume and pressure that is expressed on the
surface of cells in the lung, heart and gastrointestinal tract, among other tissues (8, 9). The ongoing spread
of SARS-CoV-2 and the disease it causes, COVID-19, has had a crippling toll on global healthcare
systems and economies, and effective treatments and vaccines are urgently needed.

As SARS-CoV-2 becomes endemic in the human population, it has the potential to mutate and
undergo genetic drift and recombination. To what extent this will occur as increasing numbers of people
are infected and mount counter immune responses is unknown, but already a variant in the viral spike
protein S (D614G) has rapidly emerged from multiple independent events and effects S protein stability
and dynamics (10, 11). Another S variant (D839Y) became prevalent in Portugal, possibly due to a
founder effect (12). SARS-CoV-2 has a moderate mutation rate estimated at 10−3 substitutions per site per
year (13). However, the virus has undergone rapid mutation and adaptation after infecting mink in
Denmark, from which it then crossed back to humans (14), causing Danish authorities to order 17 million
farmed mink culled to pre-emptively prevent the possible emergence of vaccine-resistant variants.
Additionally, large changes in coronavirus genomes have frequently occurred in nature from
recombination events, especially in bats where co-infection levels can be high (15, 16). Recombination of
MERS-CoVs has been documented in camels (17), there are reported cases of recombination between cocirculating SARS-CoV-2 variants (18), and SARS-CoV-2 itself may have emerged through

recombination of coronavirus genomes (19). This will all have profound implications for the current
pandemic's trajectory, the potential for future coronavirus pandemics, and whether drug or vaccine
resistance in SARS-CoV-2 emerges and becomes widespread.

The viral spike is a vulnerable target for neutralizing monoclonal antibodies that are progressing
through clinical trials, yet in tissue culture escape mutations in the spike rapidly emerge to all antibodies
tested (20). Deep mutagenesis of the isolated receptor-binding domain (RBD) by yeast surface display
has easily identified mutations in S that retain high expression and ACE2 affinity, yet are no longer bound
by monoclonal antibodies and confer resistance (21). This has motivated the development of cocktails of
non-competing monoclonals (20, 22), inspired by lessons learned from the treatment of HIV-1 and Ebola,
to limit the possibilities for the virus to escape. Notably, drug maker Eli Lilly has a monoclonal
monotherapy (LY-CoV555) in advanced trials (NCT04427501) where the selection of resistant virus
variants in patients has occurred. A trial update added an arm with a second monoclonal (LY-CoV016)
and the company has not reported putative resistance variants in patients receiving the cocktail thus far.
However, even the use of monoclonal cocktails does not address future coronavirus spill overs from wild
animals that may be antigenically distinct. Indeed, large screening efforts were required to find
antibodies from recovered SARS-CoV-1 patients that cross-react with SARS-CoV-2 (23), indicating
antibodies have confined capacity for interacting with variable epitopes on the spike surface, and are
unlikely to be broad and pan-specific for all SARS-related viruses.

An alternative protein-based antiviral to monoclonal antibodies is to use soluble ACE2 (sACE2) as a
decoy to compete for receptor-binding sites on the viral spike (6, 24-27). In principle, the virus has
limited potential to escape sACE2-mediated neutralization without simultaneously decreasing affinity for
the native ACE2 receptor, rendering the virus less virulent. Wild type sACE2 is currently in a phase II
clinical trial (28) and multiple groups have now engineered sACE2 to create high affinity decoys for
SARS-CoV-2 that rival matured monoclonal antibodies for potent neutralization of infection (27, 29, 30).
In our group, deep mutagenesis was used to identify a large number of mutations in ACE2 that increase
affinity for S (27). These mutations were dispersed across the interface and also at distal sites where they
are predicted to enhance folding of the virus-recognized conformation. A combination of three mutations,
called sACE22.v2.4, increases affinity 35-fold and binds SARS-CoV-2 S (KD 600 pM) with affinity
comparable to the best monoclonal antibodies (27). Even tighter apparent affinities are reached through
avid binding to trimeric spike expressed on a membrane. Despite engineering being focused exclusively
on SARS-CoV-2 affinity, sACE22.v2.4 potently neutralized authentic SARS-CoV-1 and -2 infection in
tissue culture, suggesting it's close resemblance to the wild type receptor confers broad activity against
ACE2-utilizing betacoronaviruses generally. Soluble ACE22.v2.4 is dimeric and monodisperse without
aggregation, catalytically active, highly soluble, stable after storage at 37°C for days, and well expressed
at levels greater than the wild type protein. Due to both its high activity and favorable properties for
manufacture, sACE22.v2.4 is a genuine drug candidate for preclinical development.

Engineered, high affinity decoy receptors, while very similar to natural ACE2, nonetheless have
mutations present at or near the interaction surface. There is therefore an opportunity for viral spike
variants to discriminate between an engineered decoy and wild type receptors, providing a route towards
resistance. Here, we show that the engineered decoy sACE22.v2.4 binds broadly and tightly to the RBDs
of diverse SARS-associated betacoronaviruses that use ACE2 for entry. We further fail to find mutations
within the RBD, which directly contacts ACE2 and is where possible escape mutations will most likely
reside, that redirect specificity towards the wild type receptor. We conclude that resistance to an
engineered decoy receptor will be rare, and sACE22.v2.4 targets common attributes for affinity to S in
SARS-associated viruses.

The affinities of the decoy receptor sACE22.v2.4 were determined for purified RBDs from the S
proteins of five coronaviruses from Rhinolophus bat species (isolates LYRa11, Rs4231, Rs7327, Rs4084
and RsSHC014) and two human coronaviruses, SARS-CoV-1 and SARS-CoV-2. These viruses fall
within a common clade of betacoronaviruses that have been experimentally validated to use human ACE2
as an entry receptor (7). They share close sequence identity within the RBD core while variation is
highest within the functional ACE2 binding site (Figures 1 and S1), possibly due to a co-evolutionary
'arms race' with polymorphic ACE2 sequences in ecologically diverse bat species (31). Affinity was
measured by biolayer interferometry (BLI), with sACE22 (a.a. S19-G732) fused at the C-terminus with
the Fc moiety of human IgG1 immobilized to the sensor surface and monomeric 8his-tagged RBD (Figure
S2) used as the soluble analyte. This arrangement excludes avidity effects, which otherwise cause
artificially tight (picomolar) apparent affinities whenever dimeric sACE22 in solution is bound to
immobilized RBD decorating an interaction surface. Wild type sACE22 bound all the RBDs with
affinities ranging from 16 nM for SARS-CoV-2 to 91 nM for LYRa11, with median affinity 60 nM
(Table 1). The measured affinities for the RBDs of SARS-CoV-1 and SARS-CoV-2 are comparable to
published data (4, 27, 32-34). Engineered sACE22.v2.4 displayed large increases in affinity for all the
RBDs, with KDs ranging from 0.4 nM for SARS-CoV-2 to 3.5 nM for isolate Rs4231, with median
affinity less than 2 nM (Table 1). The approximate 35-fold affinity increase of the engineered decoy
applies universally to coronaviruses in the test panel and the molecular basis for affinity enhancement
must therefore be grounded in common attributes of RBD/ACE2 recognition.

To explore potential sequence diversity in S of SARS-CoV-2 that may act as a 'reservoir' for drug
resistance, the mutational tolerance of the RBD was evaluated by deep mutagenesis (35). Saturation
mutagenesis was focused to the RBD (a.a. C336-L517) of full-length S tagged at the extracellular Nterminus with a c-myc epitope for detection of surface expression. The spike library, encompassing 3,640
single amino acid substitutions, was transfected in human Expi293F cells under conditions where cells
typically acquire no more than a single sequence variant (36, 37). The culture was incubated with wild
type, 8his-tagged, dimeric sACE22 at a sub-saturating concentration (2.5 nM). Bound sACE22-8h and
surface-expressed S were stained with fluorescent antibodies for flow cytometry analysis (Figure 2A).
Compared to cells expressing wild type S, the library was poorly expressed, indicating many mutations
are deleterious for folding and expression. A cell population was clearly discernable expressing S
variants that bind ACE2 with decreased affinity (Figure 2B). After gating for c-myc-positive cells
expressing S, cells with high and low levels of bound sACE22 were collected by fluorescence-activated
cell sorting (FACS), called the ACE2-High and ACE2-Low populations, respectively (Figure 2C). Both
the expression and sACE22 binding signals decreased over minutes to hours during sorting, possibly due
to shedding of the S1 subunit. Cells were therefore collected and pooled from three separate FACS
experiments for a combined 8 hours sort time.

Transcripts in the sorted cells were Illumina sequenced and compared to the naive plasmid library to
determine an enrichment ratio for each amino acid substitution (38). Mutations in S that express and bind
ACE2 tightly are selectively enriched in the ACE2-High sort (Figure S3); mutations that express but have
reduced ACE2 binding are selectively enriched in the ACE2-Low sort; and mutations that are poorly
expressed are depleted from both sorted populations. Positional conservation scores were calculated by
averaging the log2 enrichment ratios for each of the possible amino acids at a residue position. By adding
conservation scores for both the ACE2-High and ACE2-Low sorts we derive a score for surface
expression, which shows that the hydrophobic RBD core is tightly conserved for folding and trafficking

permissive for S surface expression. This matches the mutational tolerance of proteins generally.

For tight ACE2 binding (i.e. S variants in the ACE2-High population), conservation increases for
RBD residues at the ACE2 interface, yet mutational tolerance remains high (Figure 3C). The sequence
diversity observed among natural betacoronaviruses, which display high diversity at the ACE2 binding
site, is therefore replicated in the deep mutational scan, which predicts the SARS-CoV-2 spike tolerates
substantial genetic diversity at the receptor-binding site for function. From this accessible sequence
diversity SARS-CoV-2 might feasibly mutate to acquire resistance to monoclonal antibodies or
engineered decoy receptors targeting the ACE2-binding site.

There are two ‘hot spot’ regions for interactions at the interface that determine receptor affinity and
species adaptation, centered around ACE2 residues K31 and K353 (39). These regions are also the
locations for substitutions to ACE2 residues T27, L79, and N330 in the engineered sACE22.v2.4 decoy.
Mutations to RBD residues at these sites tend to be weakly depleted for high ACE2 binding (Figure S4),
but are much more tolerant of mutations than structural positions buried in the RBD core. To highlight a
few residues, S-Y505 that packs against the hydrocarbon chain of ACE2-K353 is notably more conserved
than most other interfacial residues, with the exceptions of partially buried residues like S-R403 and SY453 that likely have additional structural roles; S-Y489 contacting ACE2-T27 and ACE2-K31 has an
overall weak preference for aromatic amino acids; and S-G485 on a loop packed against ACE2-L79 has
highest tolerance for polar substitutions, possibly to maintain the loop conformation and solubility (Figure
S4). Some mutations are found to be highly enriched for ACE2 binding, including small hydrophobic
amino acids for S-Q493 and aromatic amino acids for S-N501 that are both anticipated to increase local
hydrophobic or aromatic ring packing. This is consistent with observations from yeast surface display of
RBD mutants (40). That these mutations predicted to increase ACE2 binding are not enriched in
circulating SARS-CoV-2 variants suggests the affinity of the virus for its receptor is already sufficient for
high transmission and peak fitness (40).

Two deep mutational scans have been reported for the isolated RBD displayed on the surface of
yeast (40, 41). We compare our data, from a selection of full-length S expressed in human cells, to the
publicly accessible Starr et al data set (40). Important residues within the RBD for surface expression of
full-length spike in human cells are closely correlated with data from yeast surface display of the isolated
RBD (Figure 3B), with the exception of a notable region. The surface of the RBD opposing the ACE2binding site (e.g. V362, Y365, and C391) is free to mutate for yeast surface display, but its sequence is
constrained in our experiments; this region of the RBD is buried by connecting structural elements to the
global fold of an S subunit in the closed-down conformation (this is the dominant conformation for S
subunits and is inaccessible to receptor binding; Figure S5) (2, 4, 42, 43). While some mutations might
have allosteric effects, we note that among substitutions of V362, Y365, and C391, mutations tend to be
lightly depleted from the ACE2-Low and heavily depleted from the ACE2-High sorted populations. No
mutations at these positions were selectively enriched in just the ACE2-High sort, as might be expected if
a mutation favored the open-up conformation through allosteric mechanisms. This is consistent with
mutations at these residues reducing ACE2 interactions through defects in folding and decreased surface
expression. Compared to single mutations that destabilize the RBD in the closed-down conformation,
more extensive engineering with multiple stabilizing mutations has been shown to shift the
conformational equilibrium of S subunits to the open-up state (44).

We used targeted mutagenesis to individually test alanine substitutions to all the cysteines in the
RBD (Figure S5). We found all cysteine-to-alanine mutations severely diminish S surface expression in

Expi293F cells, including C391A and C525A on the RBD 'backside' that were neutral in the yeast display
scan (40). These differences demonstrate that there are tighter sequence constraints on the RBD in the
context of a full spike expressed at a human cell membrane, yet overall we consider the yeast display and
the human cell data sets to closely agree.

For binding to dimeric sACE22, we note that interface residues were more tightly conserved in the
Starr et al data set (Figure 3D), possibly a consequence of three differences between the deep mutagenesis
experiments. First, our selections for ACE2 binding of S variants at the plasma membrane appears to
primarily reflect mutational effects on surface expression, which is almost certainly more stringent in
human cells. Yeast permit many poorly folded proteins to leak to the cell surface (45). Second, the yeast
selections were conducted at multiple sACE2 concentrations from which apparent KD changes were
computed (40); the Starr et al data in this regard is very comprehensive. Due to the long sort times
required for our human cell libraries where only a small fraction of cells express spike, we sorted at a
single sACE22 concentration that cannot accurately capture a range of different binding affinities
quantitatively. Third, dimeric sACE22 may geometrically complement trimeric S densely packed on a
human cell membrane, such that avidity masks the effects of affinity-reducing mutations. Nonetheless,
there is overall agreement that ACE2 binding often persists following mutations to the RBD surface, and
our data simply suggests mutational tolerance may be even greater than that already observed by Starr et
al.

Having shown that the ACE2-binding site of SARS-CoV-2 protein S tolerates many mutations, we
asked whether mutations might therefore be found that confer resistance to the engineered decoy
sACE22.v2.4. Resistance mutations are anticipated to lose affinity for sACE22.v2.4 while maintaining
binding to the wild type receptor, and are most likely to reside in the RBD where physical contacts are
made. Similar reasoning formed the foundation of a deep mutagenesis-based selection of the isolated
RBD by yeast surface display to find escape mutations to monoclonal antibodies, and the results were
predictive of escape mutations in pseudovirus growth selections (21).

To address whether escape mutations from the engineered decoy might be found in the RBD, we
repurposed the S protein library for a specificity selection. Cells expressing the library, encoding all
possible substitutions in the RBD, were co-incubated with wild type sACE22 fused to the Fc region of
IgG1 and 8his-tagged sACE22.v2.4 at concentrations where both proteins bind competitively (27). It was
immediately apparent from flow cytometry of the Expi293F culture expressing the S library that there
were cells expressing S variants shifted towards preferential binding to sACE22.v2.4, but no significant
population with preferential binding to the wild type receptor (Figures 4A and 4B). Cells expressing S
variants that might preferentially bind sACE22(WT)-IgG1 or sACE22.v2.4 were gated and collected by
FACS (Figure 4C), followed by deep sequencing of S transcripts to determine enrichment ratios. There
was close agreement between two independent replicate experiments (Figures 4D-4G). Most RBD
mutations were depleted following sorting, consistent with deleterious effects on S folding and
expression.

Soluble ACE22.v2.4 has three mutations from wild type ACE2: T27Y buried within the RBD
interface, and L79T and N330Y at the interface periphery (Figure 5A). A substantial number of mutations
in the RBD of S were selectively enriched for preferential binding to sACE22.v2.4 (Figure 5B, upper-left
quadrant). While sACE22.v2.4-specificity mutations could be found immediately adjacent to the sites of
engineered mutations in ACE2 (in particular mutations to S-F486 adjacent to ACE2-L79 and S-T500
adjacent to ACE2-N330), major hot spots for sACE22.v2.4-specificity mutations were also mapped to
RBD loop 498-506, contacting the region where the ACE2-α1 helix packs against a β-hairpin motif
(Figure 5A). By comparison, there were no hot spots in the RBD for sACE22(WT)-specificity mutations.

Indeed, only a small number of mutations were selectively enriched for preferential binding to wild type
receptor (Figure 5B), and the abundance of these putative wild type-specific mutations barely rose above
the expected level of noise in the deep mutagenesis data. In this competition assay, S binding to wild type
sACE22 is therefore more sensitive to RBD mutations than S binding to engineered sACE22.v2.4.

To determine whether the potential wild type ACE2-specific mutations found by deep mutagenesis
are real as opposed to false predictions due to data noise, we tested 24 mutants of S selectively enriched in
the wild type-specific gate by targeted mutagenesis (blue data points in Figure 5B). Only minor shifts
towards binding wild type sACE22 were observed (Figure S6). Two S mutants were investigated further
in sACE22 titration experiments, N501W and N501Y, which both retained high receptor binding and
displayed small shifts towards wild type sACE22 in the competition experiment. N501 of S is located in
the 498-506 loop and its substitution to large aromatic side chains might alter the loop conformation to
cause steric strain with nearby ACE2 mutation N330Y in sACE22.v2.4. After titrating the concentrations
of 8his-tagged sACE22(WT) and sACE22.v2.4 and measuring bound protein to S-expressing cells by flow
cytometry, it was found S-N501W and S-N501Y do show enhanced specificity for wild type sACE22, but
the effect is small and sACE22.v2.4 remains the stronger binder (Figure 5C).

Dimeric sACE22 binds avidly to S protein on a membrane surface; avid interactions are also
observed between sACE22 and spikes on authentic SARS-CoV-2 in infection assays (27). We used BLI
kinetics measurements, in which immobilized sACE22-IgG1 interacts with monomeric RBD, to determine
how the observed changes in avid sACE22 binding to S-expressing cells translate to changes in affinity.
Both N501W and N501Y mutants of SARS-CoV-2 RBD displayed increased affinity for wild type ACE2
and engineered ACE2.v2.4, with larger affinity gains in favor of the wild type receptor (Table 1). This
aligns with the flow cytometry data indicating a small shift in specificity towards wild type ACE2, but not
enough to escape the engineered decoy. By comparison, multiple independent escape mutations are
readily found in S of SARS-CoV-2 that diminish the efficacy of monoclonal antibodies by many orders of
magnitude (20, 21).

Finally, 8 representative mutations to S predicted from the deep mutational scan to increase
specificity towards sACE22.v2.4 (purple data points in Figure 5B) were cloned and 7 were found to have
large shifts towards preferential sACE22.v2.4 binding in the competition assay (Figure S7). These S
mutations were Y449K/Q/S, L455G/R/Y, and G504K. The basis for why the mutations increase
specificity towards engineered sACE22.v2.4 is ambiguous, since RBD residues Y449, L455, and G504
are not in direct contact with engineered sites of the receptor. BLI kinetics between immobilized sACE22IgG1 and monomeric RBD as the analyte showed reduced affinity of a representative mutant, RBDY449K, to both wild type and engineered sACE22 (Table 1). However, affinity changes in the picomolar
range for sACE22.v2.4 are hidden during avid binding to full-length S-Y449K at the cell surface, whereas
avid binding of wild type sACE22 to S-Y449K (with affinity measured by BLI in the moderate nanomolar
range) is substantially reduced. This finding might explain why the competition selection found many
mutations that shift specificity towards engineered ACE2, as mutations causing small decreases in affinity
may have larger effects on avid binding of the weaker-bound wild type receptor.

Overall, validation by targeted mutagenesis confirms that the selection can successfully find
mutations in S with altered specificity. The inability to find mutations in the RBD that impart high
specificity for the wild type receptor means such mutations are rare or may not even exist, at least within
the receptor-binding domain where direct physical contacts with receptors occur. We cannot exclude
mutations elsewhere having long-range conformational effects. Engineered, soluble decoy receptors
therefore live up to their promise as broad therapeutic candidates against which a virus cannot easily
escape.

The allure of soluble decoy receptors is that the virus cannot easily mutate to escape neutralization.
Mutations that reduce affinity of the soluble decoy will likely also decrease affinity for the wild type
receptor on host cells, thereby coming at the cost of diminished infectivity and virulence. However, this
hypothesis has not been rigorously tested, and since engineered decoy receptors differ from their wild
type counterparts, even if by just a small number of mutations, it is possible a virus may evolve to
discriminate between the two. Here, we show that an engineered decoy receptor for SARS-CoV-2
broadly binds with low nanomolar KD to the spikes of SARS-associated betacoronaviruses that use ACE2
for entry, despite high sequence diversity within the ACE2-binding site. Mutations in S of SARS-CoV-2
that confer high specificity for wild type ACE2 were not found in a comprehensive screen of all
substitutions within the RBD. The engineered decoy receptor is therefore broad against zoonotic ACE2utilizing coronaviruses that may spill over from animal reservoirs in the future and against variants of
SARS-CoV-2 that may arise as the current COVID-19 pandemic rages on. These findings are highly
consistent with research of a high-affinity decoy receptor engineered for a different pathogen, the human
immunodeficiency virus (HIV). An IgG1 Fc-fused soluble decoy based on HIV receptors, called eCD4Ig, broadly neutralizes HIV-1, HIV-2, and related simian viruses, with single mutations in the HIV spike
protein unable to achieve full escape (46, 47). Together with the results reported here, these studies
collectively demonstrate that engineered decoy receptors can achieve exceptional breadth against virus
sequence variants. We argue it is unlikely that decoy receptors will need to be combined in cocktail
formulations, as is required for many monoclonal antibodies and possibly designed miniprotein binders to
prevent the rapid emergence of resistance (20, 48), facilitating manufacture and distribution. Our findings
give insight into how a potential therapeutic can achieve breadth with a low chance of virus resistance for
a family of highly infectious and deadly viruses.

Plasmids. Residue numbers for constructs begin from the start methionine as amino acid (a.a.) 1. The
cloning of human codon-optimized, mature S from SARS-CoV-2 (GenBank Acc. No. YP_009724390.1;
a.a. V16-T1273) into the NheI-XhoI sites of pCEP4 (Invitrogen) with an N-terminal, extracellular c-myc
tag is described elsewhere (27). Soluble ACE2 (a.a. 1-732 encoding a dimer; wild type or engineered
variant sACE22.v2.4) fused to an 8his purification tag or to human IgG1-Fc (a.a. D221-K447; nG1m1
isoallotype; GenBank KY432415.1) and cloned in to the NheI-XhoI sites of pcDNA3.1(+) (Invitrogen) is
also previously described (27). The RBDs of SARS-CoV-1 (Urbani isolate; GenBank AAP13441.1; a.a.
T320-D518), SARS-CoV-2 (YP_009724390; a.a. T333-K529), LYRa11 (AHX37558.1; a.a. T324-D522),

a.a. T321-D519) and RsSHC014 (AGZ48806.1; a.a. T321-D519) were cloned with N-terminal influenza
HA leader peptides (sequence MKTIIALSYIFCLVFA) and C-terminal 8-his tags (sequence
GSGHHHHHHHH) into the NheI-XhoI sites of pcDNA3.1(+). These plasmids are deposited with
Addgene under accession numbers 145145 and 161821-161826. Mutations were made by overlap

Recombinant Protein Production. Plasmids (500 ng DNA per ml culture) and polyethylenimine (MW
25,000; Polysciences; 3 µg per ml culture) were mixed with OptiMEM (Gibco; 100 µl per ml culture),
incubated 20 minutes at room temperature and added to Expi293F cells at a density of 2 × 106 / ml.
Transfection Enhancers (ThermoFisher) were added 18-23 h post-transfection. Culture supernatant was
harvested 4-6 days later by two centrifugation steps (800 × g for 10 minutes to remove cells and 20,000 ×
g for 20 minutes to remove debris). IgG1 Fc fused and 8his-tagged proteins were subsequently purified as
previously described (27) using KANEKA KanCapA 3G Affinity (Pall) and HisPur Ni-NTA (Thermo
Scientific) resins, respectively. Eluted proteins from affinity chromatography were then separated on a

Superdex 200 Increase 10/300 GL column (GE Healthcare Life Sciences) equilibrated with Dulbecco's
phosphate-buffered saline (PBS). Proteins from peak fractions were concentrated using centrifugal
ultrafiltration devices (Millipore) to final concentrations of ~1 mg/ml (RBD-8h proteins), ~10 mg/ml
(sACE22-8h proteins) and ~50 mg/ml (sACE22-IgG1 proteins). Concentrations were determined by
absorbance at 280 nm using calculated extinction coefficients. Reported concentrations for sACE22 are

Biolayer Interferometry. BLI kinetics were collected on an Octet RED96a and analyzed with a 1:1
binding model (global fit) using instrument software (Molecular Devices). IgG1 Fc-fused sACE22 (wild
type or engineered variant sACE22.v2.4) were immobilized at 100 nM for 10 minutes to anti-human IgG
Fc biosensors (Molecular Devices). The assay buffer was 10 mM HEPES pH 7.6, 150 mM NaCl, 3 mM
EDTA, 0.05% polysorbate 20, 0.5% non-fat dry milk (Bio-Rad). Loaded sensors were equilibrated for 30
s in buffer, then dipped in RBD-8h solutions for 60 s to measure association and transferred back to
buffer to measure dissociation over 300 s.

Library Construction, FACS and Illumina Sequencing Analysis. Using plasmid pCEP4-myc-S
encoding tagged, full length S of SARS-CoV-2, saturation mutagenesis was focused to residues C336L517 forming the RBD. Degenerate NNK codons were introduced at all RBD positions using overlap
extension PCR as previously described (49). Transient transfection conditions were used that typically
provide no more than a single coding variant per cell (36, 37). Expi293F cells at 2 × 106 / ml were
transfected with a mixture of 1 ng coding plasmid (i.e. library DNA) with 1.5 µg pCEP4-ΔCMV carrier
plasmid (described in (37)). The medium was replaced 2 h post-transfection and cells were collected 24 h
post-transfection for FACS. Cells were washed with ice-cold PBS supplemented with 0.2 % bovine serum
albumin (PBS-BSA).

For investigations of binding to wild type sACE22, the cells expressing the S library were resuspended in
2.5 nM sACE22(WT)-8h and incubated 30 minutes on ice. Cells were washed twice with PBS-BSA and
then co-stained for 20 minutes with anti-myc Alexa 647 (clone 9B11, 1/250 dilution; Cell Signaling
Technology) and anti-HIS-FITC (chicken polyclonal, 1/100 dilution; Immunology Consultants
Laboratory). Cells were again washed twice before sorting on a BD FACS Aria II at the Roy J. Carver
Biotechnology Center. Dead cells, doublets and debris were excluded by first gating on the main
population by forward/side scattering and then excluding DAPI positive cells. From the myc-S-positive
(Alexa 647) population, the 20 % of cells with the highest and 20% of cells with the lowest anti-HISFITC fluorescence for bound sACE22(WT)-8h were collected (Figure 2C). Collection tubes were coated
overnight with fetal bovine serum prior to sorting and contained Expi293 Expression Medium.
Fluorescent signals decreased over time during FACS, and therefore transfected cultures were prepared
on three separate occasions for a combined total of 8 hours sort time. The total numbers of collected cells
were 57,000 and 72,700 for the ACE2-High and ACE2-Low gates, respectively. Collected cells were
centrifuged (500 × g, 300 s) and pellets were frozen at -80°C. Samples from the independent sorts were
pooled during extraction of total RNA.

The competition selection was performed similarly, with the exception that cells expressing the S library
were incubated for 30 minutes in a mixture of 20 nM sACE22.v2.4-8h and 25 nM sACE22(WT)-IgG1.
After washing twice, bound proteins were stained for 30 minutes with anti-human IgG-APC (clone
HP6017, 1/250 dilution; BioLegend) and anti-HIS-FITC (chicken polyclonal, 1/100 dilution;
Immunology Consultants Laboratory). Cells were washed twice and sorted. After gating for the main
population of viable cells as described above, the 20 % of cells with the highest FITC-relative-to-APC
and highest APC-relative-to-FITC signals were collected (Figure 4C). The total numbers of collected
cells were 53,950 (Replicate 1: sACE22(WT)-specific gate), 42,860 (Replicate 1: sACE22.v2.4-specific
gate), 41,420 (Replicate 2: sACE22(WT)-specific gate), and 34,730 (Replicate 2: sACE22.v2.4-specific
gate).

Total RNA was extracted from the collected cells using a GeneJET RNA purification kit (Thermo
Scientific). First strand cDNA was synthesized with Accuscript (Agilent) primed with a gene-specific
oligonucleotide. The region of S scanned by saturation mutagenesis was PCR amplified as 3 overlapping
fragments that together span the full RBD sequence. Following a second round of PCR, primers added
adapters for annealing to the Illumina flow cell and sequencing primers, together with barcodes for
experiment identification. The PCR products were sequenced on an Illumina NovaSeq 6000 using a
2×250 nt paired end protocol. Data were analyzed using Enrich (38), where the frequencies of S variants
in the transcripts of the sorted populations were compared to their frequencies in the naive plasmid
library. Log2 enrichment ratios for all the individual mutations were calculated and normalized by
subtracting the log2 enrichment ratio for the wild type sequence across the same PCR-amplified fragment.
Conservation scores at residue positions were calculated by averaging the log2 enrichment ratios for all
non-synonymous mutations at the residue.

Flow Cytometry Analysis of SARS-CoV-2 S Mutants. Expi293F cells at 2.0 × 106 cells/ml were
transfected with plasmid DNA (300 ng per ml of culture for measuring myc-S surface expression and
sACE22 competition binding, 500 ng per ml for titration experiments) encoding myc-S variants using
Expifectamine (ThermoFisher) according to the manufacturer's directions. At 24 h post-transfection, cells
were washed with PBS-BSA. To detect surface expressed myc-S, cells were incubated with anti-myc
Alexa 647 (clone 9B11, 1/250 dilution; Cell Signaling Technology) on a rocker at 4°C for 30 minutes. To
measure competitive binding of wild type and engineered receptors, cells were instead incubated with 25
nM sACE22(WT)-IgG1 and 20 nM sACE22.v2.4-8h for 30 minutes at 4°C, washed twice, and stained
with anti-human IgG-APC (clone HP6017, 1/250 dilution; BioLegend) and anti-HIS-FITC (chicken
polyclonal, 1/100 dilution; Immunology Consultants Laboratory) secondary antibodies for 20 minutes at
4°C. Finally, in titration experiments, transfected cells were incubated for 30 minutes at 4°C with 1/3
serial dilutions of sACE22(WT)-8h or sACE22.v2.4-8h, followed by two washes and a 30 minute
incubation with anti-myc Alexa 647 (clone 9B11, 1/250 dilution) and anti-HIS-FITC (chicken polyclonal,
1/100 dilution). For all experiments, cells were washed twice prior to analysis on an Accuri C6 Flow
Cytometer (BD Biosciences) and data were processed with FCS Express (De Novo Software).
Quantification of myc-S surface expression is detailed in Figure S5.

preferentially bind wild type or engineered ACE2 receptors. (A) Expi293F cells were transfected with
wild type myc-S and incubated with competing sACE22(WT)-IgG1 (25 nM) and sACE22.v2.4-8h (20
nM). Bound protein was detected by flow cytometry after immuno-staining for the respective epitope
tags. (B) As in A, except cells were transfected with the RBD SSM library. A population of cells
expressing S variants with increased specificity towards sACE22.v2.4 is apparent (cells shifted to the
upper-left of the main population). (C) Gates used for FACS of cells expressing the RBD SSM library.
After excluding cells without bound protein, the top 20% of cells for bound sACE22.v2.4-8h (magenta

Figure 5. Mutations within the RBD that confer specificity towards wild type ACE2 are rare. (A)
The SARS-CoV-2 RBD is colored by specificity score (the difference between the conservation scores for
cells collected in the sACE22(WT) and sACE22.v2.4 specific gates). Residues that are hot spots for
mutations with increased specificity towards sACE22(WT) are blue or towards sACE22.v2.4 are purple.
The contacting surface of ACE2 is shown as a green ribbon, with sites of mutations in sACE22.v2.4
labeled and shown as green spheres. (B) Log2 enrichment ratios for mutations in S expressed by cell
populations collected in the sACE22(WT) (x-axis) and sACE22.v2.4 (y-axis) specific gates. Data are the
mean from two independent sorting experiments. S mutants in blue were predicted to have increased
specificity for sACE22(WT) and were tested by targeted mutagenesis in Figure S6. S mutants in purple
were predicted to have increased specificity for sACE22.v2.4 and were tested by targeted mutagenesis in
Figure S7. Other nonsynonymous mutations are black. Nonsense mutations are red. (C) Wild type myc-S
(grey) and three variants, Y449K (purple), N501W (light blue), and N501Y (dark blue), were expressed
in Expi293F cells and tested by flow cytometry for binding to sACE22(WT)-8h (dashed lines) or
sACE22.v2.4-8h (solid lines).
