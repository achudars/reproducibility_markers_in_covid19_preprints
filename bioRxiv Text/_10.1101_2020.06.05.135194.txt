Abstract

Regulatory T (Treg) cells orchestrate resolution and repair of acute lung inflammation and injury
following viral pneumonia. Compared with younger patients, older individuals experience impaired
recovery and worse clinical outcomes after severe viral infections, including influenza and the
novel severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). Whether age is a key
determinant of Treg cell pro-repair function following lung injury remains unknown. Here, we show
that aging results in a cell-autonomous impairment of reparative Treg cell function following
experimental influenza pneumonia. Transcriptional and DNA methylation profiling of sorted Treg
cells provide insight into the mechanisms underlying their age-related dysfunction, with Treg cells
from aged mice demonstrating both loss of reparative programs and gain of maladaptive
programs. Novel strategies that restore youthful Treg cell functional programs could be leveraged
as therapies to improve outcomes among older individuals with severe viral pneumonia.

Introduction
Age is the most important risk factor determining mortality and disease severity in patients
infected with influenza virus or the novel severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARSCoV-2) (1, 2). Global estimates of seasonal influenza-associated mortality range from 300,000650,000 deaths per year, with the highest at-risk group comprised of individuals over age 75 (3).
In the United States, influenza-associated morbidity and mortality have steadily increased, an
observation linked to an expansion of the aging population. Pneumonia related to both severe
influenza A virus and SARS-CoV-2 infection results in an initial acute exudative phase
characterized by release of pro-inflammatory mediators that damage the alveolar epithelial and
capillary barrier to cause refractory hypoxemia and the acute respiratory distress syndrome
(ARDS) (4). If a patient survives this first stage, activation of resolution and repair programs during
the ensuing recovery phase is crucial for restoration of lung architecture and function, which
promotes liberation from mechanical ventilation, decreases intensive care unit length-of-stay and
extends survival.

Immunomodulatory regulatory T (Treg) cells expressing the lineage-specifying transcription factor
Foxp3 dampen inflammatory responses to both endogenous and exogenous antigens. Aside from
their role in maintaining immune homeostasis through their capacity to suppress over-exuberant
immune system activation, Treg cells reside in healthy tissues and accumulate in the lung in
response to viral injury to promote tissue repair (5, 6). Our group and others have shown that in
murine models of lung injury, Treg cells are master orchestrators of recovery (7-10). Treg cells
are capable of promoting tissue regeneration and repair, at least in part through release of
reparative mediators such as the epidermal growth factor receptor ligand amphiregulin (Areg),
which induces cell proliferation and differentiation of the injured tissue (11).

Epigenetic phenomena, including DNA methylation, modify the architecture of the genome to
control gene expression and regulate cellular identity and function throughout the lifespan (12).
Aside from being one of the best predictive biomarkers of chronological aging and age-related
disease onset, DNA methylation regulates Treg cell identity through tight epigenetic control of
Foxp3 and Foxp3-dependent programs (13). Biological aging is associated with a progressive
loss of molecular and cellular homeostatic mechanisms that maintain normal organ function,
rendering individuals susceptible to disease (14, 15). Because of their tissue-reparative functions,
Treg cells are important modulators of the immune response that promotes tissue regeneration
following injury (16). Whether age plays a key role in determining the pro-repair function of Treg
cells in the injured lung during recovery from viral pneumonia remains unknown. If aging indeed
impacts Treg cell-mediated recovery, is it a Treg cell-autonomous phenomenon or is it because
the aging lung microenvironment is resistant to Treg cell-mediated repair? Using heterochronic
(age-mismatched) adoptive Treg cell transfer experiments and molecular profiling in mice, we
sought to determine whether the age-related impairment in repair following influenza-induced lung
injury is intrinsic to Treg cells. Our data support a paradigm in which aged Treg cells fail to
upregulate youthful reparative programs, activate maladaptive responses and consequently
exhibit a cell-autonomous impairment in pro-recovery function, which delays resolution from viralinduced lung injury in aged hosts.

Results
Aging results in increased susceptibility to influenza-induced lung injury due to impaired recovery
To evaluate the age-related susceptibility to influenza-induced lung injury, we administered
influenza A/WSN/33 (H1N1) virus via the intratracheal route to young (2 months) and aged (18
months) wild-type mice. Aged mice exhibited > 50% mortality when compared with young animals
(Figure 1A), impaired recovery of total body weight following a similar nadir (Figure 1B) and more
severe lung injury by histopathology at a late recovery time point, day 60 post-infection (Figure
1C). At this same time point, aged mice also displayed an increase in the total number of cells
per lung (Figure 1D), which were mainly comprised of immune cells identified by the panhematopoietic marker CD45 (Figure 1E), suggesting non-resolving tissue inflammation during
recovery in older mice. We next wanted to determine whether the age-related susceptibility to
influenza-induced lung injury was due to a differential inflammatory response during the initial
acute injury phase. Accordingly, we examined a different group of young and aged mice at a time
point when viral clearance was complete (17) and weight nadir was observed in both groups, 14
days post-infection. Aged mice demonstrated increased mortality when compared with young
animals at this time point (Supplemental Figure 1A), but other markers of acute inflammation,
including weight loss (Supplemental Figure 1B), total lung cells (Supplemental Figure 1C) and
total lung CD45+ cells in surviving animals were not significantly different between groups
(Supplemental Figure 1D). Collectively, these results suggest that aging results in similar early
injury but persistent lung inflammatory pathology during the recovery phase of influenza-induced
lung injury.

Aging results in deficient repair following influenza-induced lung injury
Having established that aging results in an increased susceptibility to persistent lung injury after
influenza infection, we explored whether the impaired recovery in aged mice was linked to a
persistent failure to repopulate the structural components of the alveolar-capillary barrier (i.e.,
failure to repair). Flow cytometry analysis (Supplemental Figure 2) of lung single-cell
suspensions at day 60 post-influenza infection revealed an increased percentage of alveolar
epithelial type 2 (AT2) cells (CD45-, T1α-, CD31-, EpCAM+/CD326+, MHCII+) and endothelial cells
(CD45-, T1α-, EpCAM-/CD326-, CD31+) (Figure 2A-B and Figure 2D-E, respectively), and a
significant increase in the total number of AT2 and endothelial cells when compared with the naïve
state (Figure 2C and Figure 2F, respectively).

In previous studies, investigators demonstrated that following influenza-induced lung injury, a
population of cytokeratin 5+ (Krt5+) basal-like cells expand and migrate to the distal airspaces in
an attempt to repair the injured epithelial barrier (18). These cells lack the capacity to

transdifferentiate into functional AT2 cells, resulting in a dysplastic response that contributes to a
dysregulated and incomplete repair phenotype following injury (19). Using a flow cytometry
quantitative approach, we found that at 60 days post-infection, aged mice showed a significant
increase in Krt5+ cells compared with young animals (Figure 2G-H). In summary, older mice failed
to repair the injured lung during the recovery phase of influenza-induced lung injury.

Aging determines the pro-recovery function of Treg cells following influenza-induced lung injury
We and others have identified an essential role for regulatory T (Treg) cells in orchestrating
resolution and repair of acute lung injury (7-11). Having established that aged mice fail to repair
the injured lung, we next sought to determine whether this finding is due to age-related features
altering the lung microenvironment or is driven by cell-autonomous, age-associated Treg cell
factors. Thus, we performed heterochronic (age-mismatched) adoptive transfer of 1x106 splenic

young or aged Treg cells via retro-orbital injection into aged or young mice 24 hours post-infection
(Figure 3A). Notably, adoptive transfer of young Treg cells into aged hosts resulted in improved
survival when compared with aged mice that received PBS (control), while adoptive transfer of
aged Treg cells into young hosts worsened their survival when compared with their respective
controls (Figure 3B). We next turned to an inducible Treg cell depletion system using Foxp3DTR
mice in order to eliminate Treg cells from recipients and specifically determine the age-related
effect of donor Treg cells on the susceptibility to influenza-induced lung injury (Figure 3C).
Adoptive transfer of aged Treg cells into Treg cell-depleted Foxp3DTR mice 5 days post-infection
resulted in increased mortality when compared with adoptive transfer of young Treg cells (Figure
3D). Combined, our findings demonstrate that the loss of the Treg cell-associated pro-repair
function in aged hosts is dominated by intrinsic, age-related changes in Treg cells and not
conferred extrinsically by the aging lung microenvironment.

Aging results in the loss of pro-repair transcriptional programs in Treg cells during recovery from
influenza-induced lung injury
To further explore the mechanisms underpinning the age-related loss of Treg cell pro-repair
function following influenza infection, we performed gene expression profiling using RNA-seq on
flow cytometry sorted lung Treg cells (Supplemental Figure 3) during the naïve state or late
recovery phase from influenza (day 60 post-infection) (Figure 4A). Principal component analysis
(PCA) of 3,132 differentially expressed genes (DEGs) after multiple group testing with false
discovery rate (FDR) q-value < 0.05 demonstrated tight clustering by group assignment with PC1
reflecting the transcriptional response to influenza infection and PC2 reflecting age (Figure 4B).
K-means clustering of these differentially expressed genes demonstrated that Cluster II was both
the largest cluster and the one that defined the differential response to influenza infection between
naïve and influenza-treated mice (Figure 4C). Notably, genes from this cluster were significantly
upregulated among young Treg cells when compared with aged Treg cells following influenza
infection (Figure 4D). Functional enrichment analysis revealed that this cluster was enriched for
processes related to tissue and vasculature development and extracellular matrix formation
(Figure 4C), suggesting a predominant reparative phenotype in young compared with aged Treg
cells.

following enrichment for CD4+ T cells via magnetic bead separation.

We then performed an unsupervised analysis of the response to influenza infection from the naïve
state to recovery phase between young and aged Treg cells. This analysis revealed upregulation
of 1,174 genes (log2[fold-change] > 0.5, FDR q-value < 0.05) mostly linked to lung development
(including epithelial and endothelial cell differentiation), extracellular matrix organization and
wound healing (Foxp2, Hhip, Klf2, Tns3, Hoxa5, Epcam, Erg, Bmper, Ereg, Lox, Tnc, Lama3 and
Spp1) in young hosts (Figure 5A-B). We also found increased expression of genes associated
with specialized Treg cell function in the maintenance of non-lymphoid tissue homeostasis and
regenerative function (Il1rl1 (encodes ST2), Il18r1, Il10 and Areg). Aged Treg cells demonstrated
increased expression of cell cycle genes (Kif15 and Cdk1), neutrophil chemotaxis (Cxcr1, Cxcl1
and S100a9) and cytotoxic effector function (Gmzk). Gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA) of the
pairwise comparison between young and aged Treg cells during the recovery phase following
influenza infection revealed that aged Treg cells downregulated repair-associated processes such
as epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition, myogenesis and angiogenesis when compared with
young hosts (Figure 5C). This pairwise comparison demonstrated that while young Treg cells
exhibited significantly increased expression of genes associated with naïve (un-activated) state
and lymphoid tissue markers akin to central Treg (cTreg) cell phenotype (Lef1, Sell, Satb1, Bcl2,
S1pr1, Gpr83 and Igfbp4), aged Treg cells upregulated genes implicated in effector Th1, Th17
and Tfr differentiation (Tbx21/Cxcr3, Hif-1a and Sostdc1, respectively), cell cycle (Ccna2, Mmc3
and Msi2), T cell anergy (Rnf128) and DNA damage response (Xrcc5 and Rm1) (Figure 5C).
Collectively, these results reveal that while young Treg cells display a reparative phenotype during
the recovery phase from influenza infection, aged Treg cells demonstrate both a less robust prorepair phenotype when compared with young hosts and exhibit features of age-related

Regulatory T cells from aged mice demonstrate a Th1-like phenotype during recovery from
influenza pneumonia
Upon stimulation, Treg cells can exhibit phenotypic and functional adaptability through
upregulation of transcription factors and chemokine receptors akin to effector T helper cell subsets
(e.g., Th1, Th2, Th17 and T follicular regulatory or Tfr) (21). The resulting effector Treg (eTreg)
cells with Th-like phenotypes migrate to inflammatory non-lymphoid tissues and acquire
transcriptional and functional programs that mirror the T effector responses they intend to
suppress (22, 23). Having observed transcriptional upregulation of effector-associated factors in
the aged Treg cell response during recovery from influenza infection, we next performed flow
cytometry analysis to quantify some of the canonical effector-associated transcription factors and

cytokines at the protein level. During the recovery phase following influenza infection, aged mice
exhibited a higher percentage of eTregs when compared with young hosts (Supplemental Figure
4A). These aged eTreg cells demonstrated significant upregulation of the transcription factors
Tbet and Ror-γt, which are canonical master regulators of Th1 and Th17 responses, respectively
(Supplemental Figure 4B). Intracellular cytokine profiling of these cells also demonstrated a
significant increase in production of Ifn-γ by aged Treg cells (Supplemental Figure 4C) when
compared with young cells. Profiling of multiple well-established Treg cell suppressive markers,
including Foxp3, showed no significant age-related difference during the recovery phase of
influenza infection (Supplemental Figure 5). These data suggest that aged Treg cells mainly
upregulate effector programs that, while protective during an insult such as influenza-induced
acute lung injury, when observed during the recovery phase could represent an age-related
maladaptive Treg cell response leading to unremitting lung inflammation and injury.

cells during recovery from influenza infection. Representative flow cytometry histogram plots of
Treg cell-associated activation and suppressive markers in lungs of young and aged mice

All pairwise comparisons of each marker’s median fluorescence intensity (MFI) were not
statistically significant by the Mann-Whitney test.

Aged mice exhibit a less robust reparative response than young hosts during recovery from
influenza pneumonia
To further investigate the age-related reparative function of Treg cells during the recovery phase
of influenza infection, we performed pairwise comparisons of both young and aged Treg cells
from the naïve state and recovery phase (day 60 post-infection) (Supplemental Figure 6A-B).
We found that during the Treg cell response to influenza, there were 1,678 upregulated genes in
young mice and only 445 upregulated genes in aged mice when compared with their respective
naïve state (FDR q-value < 0.05). Gene set enrichment analysis revealed upregulation of prorepair hallmark processes in both young and aged Treg cells during recovery from influenza
infection (Supplemental Figure 6C-D). We next compared the age-related transcriptional
response to influenza infection and found 342 shared genes between both age groups that were
associated with pro-repair processes (Supplemental Figure 6E). The remaining 1,336 uniquely
upregulated genes in young Treg cells were linked to reparative processes in contrast with the
103 uniquely upregulated genes in aged Treg cells. Altogether, these results suggest that while
aged Treg cells show a reparative response during recovery from influenza infection, it is not as
robust as the response exhibited by young Treg cells.

DNA methylation regulates the transcriptional pro-repair response to influenza infection
In addition to representing one of the hallmarks of aging, epigenetic phenomena such as DNA
methylation regulate the development, differentiation and functional specialization of T cell
lineages, including Treg cells (12-14). Therefore, we reasoned that age-related changes to the
Treg cell DNA methylome could inform the divergent pro-repair transcriptional response seen
between young and aged Treg cells following influenza infection. We performed genome-wide

recovery phase following influenza infection (day 60) (Figure 6A). PCA of ~70,000 differentially
methylated cytosines (DMCs, FDR q-value < 0.05) revealed tight clustering according to group
assignment with the main variance across the dataset (PC1) reflecting methylation changes due
to age (Figure 6B), consistent with prior studies (15, 24). We next identified genes that were both
differentially expressed and had differentially methylated cytosines within their gene promoters
(ANOVA, FDR q-value <0.05), and found 1,319 genes meeting this parameter threshold (Figure
6C). K-means clustering of gene expression levels revealed a substantial similarity to the DEG
heat map shown in Figure 4C. Gene set enrichment analysis of these genes demonstrated that
this methylation-regulated gene expression program was associated with pro-recovery processes
and was significantly skewed toward young Treg cells (Figure 6C). Combined, these results show
that age-related DNA methylation regulates the pro-reparative transcriptional regulatory network
during recovery from influenza-induced lung injury.

Discussion
We sought to unambiguously address the paradigm of how aging affects Treg cell function during
recovery from influenza pneumonia. We used heterochronic (age-mismatched) Treg cell adoptive
transfer following influenza infection to establish that the age-related pro-repair function of these
cells is determined by cell-autonomous mechanisms. While adoptive transfer of young Treg cells
into aged or Treg-cell depleted hosts demonstrated a salutary effect, the transfer of aged cells
into young or Treg-cell depleted hosts had a detrimental impact on mortality. Comprehensive
transcriptional and DNA methylation profiling revealed age-related epigenetic repression of the
youthful reparative gene expression profile and activation of maladaptive responses in lung Treg
cells among aged hosts.

The ongoing coronavirus disease 19 (COVID-19) pandemic caused by the severe acute
respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) represents an unprecedented challenge for
the scientific community to identify novel pharmacotherapies and strategies for effective disease
management. Both influenza A virus- and SARS-CoV-2-induced lung injury disproportionately
affect the elderly, comprising most infection-related deaths (1, 25, 26). Here, we found that similar
to human epidemiologic data and previous pre-clinical murine studies, aged mice exhibit
increased susceptibility and impaired recovery following influenza infection. Injury to alveolar
epithelial type I, II and endothelial cells disrupts the tight gas exchange barrier causing
accumulation of fluid and pro-inflammatory mediators in the alveolar space, a hallmark of ARDS
pathophysiology (4). Notably, we found that during late recovery from influenza infection, aged
hosts demonstrated a decreased number of alveolar epithelial type II cells and endothelial cells
when compared with young animals, suggesting that failure to repopulate the alveolar lining
contributes to the observed age-related impairment in recovery. Severe influenza infection leads
to a robust expansion of Krt5+ cells, which migrate distally to form cystic-like structures or pods
intended to cover the damaged alveolar wall (19). These pods persist long after the initial infection,

lack the capacity to generate a functional alveolar epithelium and therefore constitute an
insufficient reparative response to injury (19). Here, we showed that aged animals display an
increased percentage of Krt5+ cells during the recovery phase of influenza-induced lung injury,
which reflects the dysregulated repair response in aged hosts.

Over the past decade, regulatory T cells have emerged as key mediators of wound healing and
tissue regeneration (6, 16, 27). This group of specialized cells has been primarily known for their
ability to suppress effector immune cell subsets leading to resolution of inflammation, but they are
also capable of directly affecting tissue regeneration through production of pro-repair mediators
such as amphiregulin and keratinocyte growth factor (11, 28, 29). Investigators have
demonstrated that aging can negatively impact the composition and function of the Treg cell pool
throughout the lifespan, rendering them inefficient as facilitators of tissue repair (30). This decline
might occur through cell-autonomous mechanisms resulting in T cell maladaptive responses that
lead to increased susceptibility to disease. For instance, loss of stemness accompanied by
differentiation into pro-inflammatory Th1/Th17 phenotypes, activation of DNA damage responses
and the senescence secretome are among some of the T cell maladaptations that result from the
mounting challenges to which the T cell repertoire is exposed over a lifetime (20). These T cell
maladaptive changes could also result from an age-related loss in stromal signals and circulating
factors from the tissue microenvironment that either affect T cell function directly or render the
microenvironment resistant to T cell responses. Our heterochronic adoptive Treg cell transfer
experiments definitively address this paradigm, showing that the observed age-related Treg cell
dysfunction is due to cell-autonomous mechanisms and dominant over the aged pulmonary
microenvironment. Our data demonstrate that aging not only imparts a loss of pro-recovery Treg
cell function, but also a gain of some of these maladaptive features when compared with young
hosts.

What are the molecular mechanisms underpinning the age-associated Treg cell gain or loss-of
pro-reparative function in the lung following influenza infection? Gene expression profiling of lung
Treg cells during the recovery phase of influenza infection showed that young Treg cells
significantly upregulated genes (when compared with aged Treg cells) linked to biologic
processes associated with a robust pro-repair signature, including extracellular matrix
organization, alveologenesis and vasculogenesis. Here, we demonstrate that the young Treg cell
pro-repair program is dominated by Areg expression, accompanied by upregulation of IL-18 and
IL-33 receptors and other genes related to the above-mentioned reparative processes.
Interestingly, we found no difference when comparing the suppressive phenotype of young versus
aged Treg cells, suggesting that following influenza-induced lung injury, the reparative program
of Treg cells is separable and distinct from their suppressive program. This is an important
observation that informs the development of novel Treg cell-based immunotherapies to
specifically target molecular pathways regulating their reparative function. In regard to aged Treg
cells, we found that although capable of upregulating a pro-repair program following influenza
infection, it is less robust when compared with the youthful reparative response. Moreover, aged
Treg cells displayed increased expression of genes associated with an effector phenotype.
Accordingly, we found increased expression of Th1 canonical markers, Tbet and Ifn-γ. Whether
this finding represents an age-related functional adaptability of Treg cells following influenza
infection or it is the result of Treg cell lineage instability leading to effector differentiation remains
unknown.

Establishment of a Treg cell specific DNA hypomethylation pattern at key genomic loci is
necessary to maintain the lineage stability and immunosuppressive function of Treg cells (13).
Epigenomic profiling has revealed that Treg cell-specific alterations in methylation patterning
modulate Treg cell transcriptional programs and increase susceptibility to human autoimmune
diseases (31). Whether epigenetic phenomena have a similar regulatory role in modulating the

Treg cell reparative gene expression program remains unknown. Here, we used an unsupervised
bioinformatics analysis to uncover a Treg cell-specific methylation-regulated transcriptional
program enriched for reparative processes during recovery from influenza infection. Our
computational integrative approach provides inferential evidence that age-related DNA
methylation can modify the expression of genes linked to pro-repair processes in Treg cells but
does not prove causality and therefore represents a limitation of our study. Future research could
focus on leveraging epigenome editing technologies to establish the causality of age-related, Treg
cell-specific DNA methylation patterns in controlling their regenerative function.

In conclusion, our study establishes that aging imparts cell-autonomous dysfunction to the
reparative capacity of Treg cells following influenza pneumonia. The youthful reparative
transcriptional response of Treg cells is dominated by processes linked to epithelial and
endothelial cell repair and extracellular matrix remodeling, and demonstrate regulation by DNA
methylation. Aged Treg cells exhibited a less robust reparative program and displayed features
of maladaptive T cell responses. These findings carry important implications for the development
of small molecule- and Treg cell-based therapeutics that promote restoration of lung architecture
and function following viral pneumonia in our increasingly older population.

Materials and Methods
Mice
Young (2-4-month-old) and aged (18-22-month-old) C57BL/6 mice were obtained from NIA Aged
Rodent Colony. Foxp3DTR mice were purchased from The Jackson Laboratory (Jax 016958).
Animals received water ad libitum, were housed at a temperature range of 20-23 °C under 14/10hour light/dark cycles, and received standard rodent chow. All animal experiments and
procedures were conducted in accordance with the standards established by the United States
Animal Welfare Act set forth in National Institutes of Health guidelines and were approved by the
Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee (IACUC) at Northwestern University.

Administration of influenza A virus and lung histopathology
Wild-type C57BL/6 mice were anesthetized with isoflurane and intubated using a 20-gauge
angiocatheter cut to a length that placed the tip of the catheter above the carina. Mice were
instilled with a mouse-adapted influenza A virus (A/WSN/33 [H1N1]) (3 pfu/mouse or 2 pfu/mouse
for Foxp3DTR mice, in 50 µL of sterile PBS) as previously described (32).

To prepare organ tissues for histopathology, the inferior vena cava was cut and the right
ventricle was perfused in situ with 10 mL of sterile PBS and then sutured a 20-gauge
angiocatheter into the trachea via a tracheostomy. The lungs were removed en bloc and inflated
to 15 cm H2O with 4% paraformaldehyde. 5-µm sections from paraffin-embedded lungs were
stained with hematoxylin-eosin and examined using light microscopy with the high-throughput,
automated, slide imaging system, TissueGnostics (TissueGnostics GmbH).

Tissue preparation, flow cytometry analysis and sorting
Single-cell suspensions from harvested mouse lungs were prepared and stained for flow
cytometry analysis and fluorescence-activated cell sorting as previously described using the

reagents shown in Supplemental Table 1 (33, 34). The CD4+ T Cell Isolation Kit, mouse (Miltenyi)
was used to enrich CD4+ T cells in single-cell suspensions prior to flow cytometry sorting. Cell
counts of single-cell suspensions were obtained using a Cellometer with AO/PI staining
(Nexcelom Bioscience) before preparation for flow cytometry. Data acquisition for analysis was
performed using a BD Symphony A5 instrument with FACSDiva software (BD). Cell sorting was
performed using the 4-way purity setting on BD FACSAria SORP instruments with FACSDiva
software. Analysis was performed with FlowJo v10.6.1 software.

Cytokine measurements
Lungs were harvested from young and aged mice and a single-cell suspension was obtained.
Red blood cells were removed with ACK Lysis Buffer (Thermo Fisher) following the
manufacturer’s instructions. Single-cell suspensions were plated on 12-well cell culture plates
(Thermo Fisher) at a concentration of 1 x 106 cells/mL with RPMI plus 2 µL/mL Leukocyte
Activation Cocktail with GolgiPlug (BD) and incubated for 4 hours at 37 °C. After incubation, cells
were resuspended in PBS and stained with a viability dye and subsequently with fluorochromeconjugated antibodies directed at IFN-γ (clone XMG1.2), IL-17 (clone TC11-18H1) and IL-4 (clone
11B11). Data acquisition and analysis was performed as described above.

Treg cell isolation and adoptive transfer
Splenic CD4+CD25+ Treg cells were isolated from euthanized young (2-4-month-old) and aged
(18-22-month-old) C57BL/6 mice by use of magnetic separation with the EasySepTM Mouse
CD4+CD25+ Regulatory T Cell Isolation Kit II (STEMCELL Technologies) according to the
manufacturer’s instructions. A separate group of young and aged C57BL/6 mice were challenged
with 3 pfu/mouse of influenza A virus as previously described (32). Twenty-four hours later a
single-cell suspension of isolated 1 x 106 splenic Treg cells in 100 µL of sterile PBS was obtained

and transferred via retro-orbital injection into the influenza-treated mice. Foxp3DTR mice were
challenged with 2 pfu/mouse of influenza A virus. Diphtheria toxin (List Biologicals, CA) was
administered via intraperitoneal injection in 100µL of sterile PBS in the following doses and days
relative to influenza A virus infection (day 0): 50 mcg/Kg on day -2 and 10 mcg/Kg every 48 hours
starting on day 0 and ending on day 28 post-infection. Five days later, 1 x 106 young or aged
splenic Treg cells in 100 µL of sterile PBS were transferred via retro-orbital injection into the
influenza-treated Foxp3DTR mice.

RNA-sequencing
Flow cytometry sorted lung Treg cells were pelleted in RLT plus buffer with 2-mercaptoethanol
and stored at -80 °C until RNA extraction was performed. The Qiagen AllPrep DNA/RNA Micro
Kit was used for RNA and DNA simultaneous isolation (35). RNA quality was assessed with the
4200 TapeStation System (Agilent Technologies). mRNA was isolated from purified 1 ng total
RNA using oligo-dT beads (New England Biolabs, Inc). NEBNext Ultra™ RNA kit was used for
full-length cDNA synthesis and library preparation. Libraries were pooled, denatured and diluted,
resulting in a 2.0 pM DNA solution. PhiX control was spiked at 1%. Libraries were sequenced on
an Illumina NextSeq 500 instrument (Illumina Inc) using NextSeq 500 High Output reagent kit
(1x75 cycles). For RNA-seq analysis, FASTQ reads were demultiplexed with bcl2fastq v2.17.1.14,
trimmed with Trimmomatic v0.38 (to remove low quality basecalls), and aligned to the Mus
musculus or mm10 (GRCm38) reference genome using TopHat v.2.1.0. Resultant bam files were
imported into SeqMonk v1.45.4 to generate raw counts table with RNA-seq quantitation pipeline
and filtered by protein-coding genes. Annotated probe reports from SeqMonk were imported into
RStudio for downstream analysis. Differential gene expression analysis was performed with the
edgeR v3.28.1 R/Bioconductor package using R v3.6.3 and RStudio v1.2.1578 (36). A genomic

was performed using the Broad Institute’s GSEA v4.0.3 software with the GSEAPreranked tool.
A ranked gene list from young and aged phenotypes was ordered by log2(fold-change) in average
expression, using 1,000 permutations and the Hallmark gene set database (37).

Modified reduced representation bisulfite sequencing
Genomic DNA was isolated from sorted lung Treg cells using Qiagen AllPrep DNA/RNA Micro
Kit. Endonuclease digestion, fragment size selection, bisulfite conversion and library preparation
were performed as previously described (36, 38-40). Sequencing was performed on NextSeq 500
instrument (Illumina). DNA methylation analysis and quantification were performed using Trim
Galore! v0.4.3, Bismark v0.16.3, DSS v2.30.1 R/Bioconductor package and the bisulphite feature
methylation pipeline from the SeqMonk platform. Mus musculus or mm10 (GRCm38) was used
as the reference genome.
