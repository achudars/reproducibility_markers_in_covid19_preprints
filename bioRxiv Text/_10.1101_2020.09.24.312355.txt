ABSTRACT
Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) represents a new global threat demanding a
multidisciplinary effort to fight its etiological agent—severe acute respiratory syndrome
coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). In this regard, immunoinformatics may aid to predict
prominent immunogenic regions from critical SARS-CoV-2 structural proteins, such as the
spike (S) glycoprotein, for their use in prophylactic or therapeutic interventions against this
rapidly emerging coronavirus. Accordingly, in this study, an integrated immunoinformatics
approach was applied to identify cytotoxic T cell (CTC), T helper cell (THC), and Linear B
cell (BC) epitopes from the S glycoprotein in an attempt to design a high-quality multiepitope vaccine. The best CTC, THC, and BC epitopes showed high viral antigenicity, lack
of allergenic or toxic residues, and suitable HLA-viral peptide interactions. Remarkably,
SARS-CoV-2 receptor-binding domain (RBD) and its receptor-binding motif (RBM)
harbour several potential epitopes. The structure prediction, refinement, and validation data
indicate that the multi-epitope vaccine has an appropriate conformation and stability. Three
conformational epitopes and an efficient binding between Toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4) and
the vaccine model were observed. Importantly, the population coverage analysis showed
that the multi-epitope vaccine could be used globally. Notably, computer-based simulations
suggest that the vaccine model has a robust potential to evoke and maximize both immune
effector responses and immunological memory to SARS-CoV-2. Further research is needed
to accomplish with the mandatory international guidelines for human vaccine formulations.

1. Introduction

2

On 31st December, 2019, a dramatic increase in the number of patients with a

3

potentially fulminant respiratory disease was reported in Wuhan, China [1]. The etiological

4

agent was eventually identified as a novel highly pathogenic betacoronavirus—severe acute

5

respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) [2]. Shortly thereafter, SARS-CoV-2

6

caused an overwhelming wave of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) cases across Asia,

7

Europe, Oceania, the Americas, and Africa, which led to the World Health Organization

8

declared COVID-19 as a pandemic on 11th March, 2020 [1]. Unfortunately, at the time of

9

this research, no clinically approved treatment is available to fight SARS-CoV-2, whose

10

rapid spread has generated an explosive second wave of COVID-19 all over the world [1].

11

The SARS-CoV-2 outer membrane is decorated with several structural proteins,

12

including the S glycoprotein, the membrane protein, and the envelope protein [3]. The S

13

glycoprotein forms homotrimers containing both a receptor-binding domain (RBD) and a

14

receptor-binding motif (RBM) [4]. The latter mediates contacts with human angiotensin-

15

converting enzyme 2 (hACE2), thereby allowing SARS-CoV-2 entry into host cell [4]. This

16

critical role in viral pathogenesis turns the SARS-CoV-2 S glycoprotein into an attractive

17

target for vaccine development [5].

18

Multi-epitope vaccines designed from immunoinformatics tools could aid to elicit a

19

protective immune response against SARS-CoV-2, as reported previously for other

20

infectious agents [6,7]. In this regard, recent data indicate that the SARS-CoV-2 S

21

glycoprotein harbours prominent immunologically active regions, which may serve as

22

candidates for multi-epitope vaccine models [8-11]. Accordingly, the present study aimed

23

to design a multiple-epitope vaccine construct against SARS-CoV-2 using for this purpose

24

an integrated in silico approach.

28

Taking into account that the SARS-CoV-2 S glycoprotein represents the major target for

29

vaccine development [5], the present work focused only on such viral spike. The complete

30

amino acid sequence of the SARS-CoV-2 S glycoprotein was retrieved from Uniprot

31

(http://www.uniprot.org/) in FASTA format (accession number: P0DTC2). Fig. 1

32

summarises the in silico experimental work.

33

2.2. Prediction of allergenicity, toxicity, and viral antigenicity

34

Prior to clinical trials, safety evaluations of new vaccine candidates must include

35

allergenicity and toxicity studies to avoid possible harm to humans due to the vaccine

36

active ingredients [12]. Therefore, potential epitopes from the S glycoprotein were

37

subjected to allergenic evaluation using two webservers: AlergenFP (http://ddg-

38

pharmfac.net/AllergenFP/index.html)

39

(www.imtech.res.in/raghava/algpred/) [14], whereas toxicity was predicted using the

40

ToxinPred server (http://crdd.osdd.net/raghava/toxinpred/) [15]. Finally, viral antigenicity

41

was calculated from the Vaxijen server (threshold: 0.5) (www.ddg-pharmfac.net/vaxijen/)

42

[16].

43

2.3. Immunogenicity

[13],

and

Algepred

44

Vaccine-mediated protection is intrinsically related to the activation of the cell-mediated

45

and humoral responses [17]. The cell-mediated response is mainly based on the clonal

46

expansion of human leukocyte antigen (HLA) class I-restricted CD8+ cytotoxic T cells

47

(CTC), which are critical to antiviral defence during acute infection, and HLA class II-

48

restricted CD4+ T helper cells (THC), which are necessary for the generation of specific

49

antiviral antibodies when they crosstalk with B cells (BC) [18]. The humoral response, in

50

contrast, involves the production of antibodies by BC [18]. Therefore, CTC, THC, and BC

51

epitopes were predicted and the best were selected for the final vaccine design (Fig. 1). To

52

achieve this aim, multiple prediction tools were used to improve the rate of true positives.

53

2.3.1. Prediction of CTC and THC epitopes

54

Peptides that interact with HLA class I (HLA-I) and HLA class II (HLA-II) molecules

55

commonly have 9 and 15 amino acids in length, respectively [18]. In consequence, 9-mer

56

and 15-mer peptides were considered in this work as CTC and THC epitopes, respectively

57

(Fig. 1). These epitopes were identified using the Immune Epitope Database and Analysis

58

Resource (IEDB-AR) (http://tools.immuneepitope.org/main/) [19].

59

To cross-validate binding peptides to HLA molecules, several methods were applied. In

60

this regard, the 9-mer binding peptides to HLA-I were predicted using the artificial neural

61

network (ANN) method [20], the Consensus method [21], and the NetMHCpan method

62

[22]. The prediction of the 15-mer binding peptides to HLA-II was performed using the

63

Consensus method [23], the NetMHCIIpan method [24], and the SMM-align method [25].

64

Peptides were selected according to their percentile rank—peptides with a small percentile

65

rank have high affinity by HLA alleles [21]. This percentile rank is generated on IEDB-AR

66

by comparing the IC50 of each predicted peptide against random peptides from

67

SWISSPROT database.

68

In addition, binding peptides to HLA-II were also chosen by their potential to induce

69

interferon-gamma (IFN-g) (Fig. 1), which was evaluated using the IFNepitope server

70

(http://crdd.osdd.net/raghava/ifnepitope/) [26].

71

2.3.2. Prediction of linear BC epitopes

72

BCPRED (http://ailab.ist.psu.edu/bcpred/) [27] was used to predict linear BC epitopes

73

based on several physicochemical properties: hydrophilicity, flexibility, accessibility, and

74

antigenicity propensity (threshold = 1 for each parameter). Simultaneously, the S

75

glycoprotein

76

(http://thegleelab.org/iBCE-EL/)

77

(http://www.cbs.dtu.dk/services/BepiPred/) [29] for additional predictions of linear BC

78

epitopes.

83

and HLA-DRB1*01:01 were predicted as common interacting HLA alleles, they were

84

selected for this purpose.

85

The molecular docking simulation process is summarised as follows. First, the best 3D

86

structure of each epitope (9-mer and 15-mer peptides) was obtained from PEPFOLD server

87

(https://bioserv.rpbs.univ-paris-diderot.fr/services/PEP-FOLD3/) [30]. Second, the 3D

88

structure of HLA-C*06:02 and HLA-DRB1*01:01 were downloaded from Protein Data

89

Bank (PDB) (accession numbers: 5W6A and 1AQD, respectively). Third, the receptor‐

90

ligand

91

(http://bioinfo3d.cs.tau.ac.il/PatchDock/), which is based on shape complementarity

92

principles [31]. Fourth, the receptor-ligand complexes were visualized with the VMD

93

software (Version 1.9.3) [32]. Finally, the best allele-epitope complexes were selected

94

based upon visual inspection and the PatchDock criteria, as well as they were compared

95

with their respective control peptides (co-crystal ligands of HLA-C*06:02 and HLA-

96

DRB1*01:01).

the

server

98

High potential CTC, THC, and linear BC epitopes were selected to generate the amino

99

acid sequence of the multi-epitope vaccine. The CTC and THC epitopes were linked

100

together using AAY and GPGPG linkers, respectively, whereas linear BC epitopes were

101

connected by KK linkers (Fig. 1). Moreover, a TLR4 agonist, known as RS09 (Sequence:

102

APPHALS) [33], was added as an adjuvant at the N-terminus by using an EAAAK linker

103

(Fig. 1). This adjuvant was chosen because of two relevant points: 1) the coronaviruses S

104

glycoprotein may bind and activate TLR4 [34]; 2) a previous report has shown that RS09

105

favours a good binding affinity between multi-epitope vaccines and TLR4 [35]. For future

106

purification and identification purposes, a polyhistidine-tag (6x-H tag) was included at the

107

C-terminus (Fig. 1).

108

2.4.1. Physicochemical evaluation and general studies

109

The ProtParam tool (https://web.expasy.org/protparam/) [36] was used to examine

110

relevant physiochemical parameters of the multi-epitope vaccine. To reconfirm its viral

111

antigenicity and lack of allergenicity and toxicity, the web tools described in section 2.2

112

were applied. In addition, the vaccine solubility was predicted using the SOLpro server

113

(http://scratch.proteomics.ics.uci.edu/) [37].

114

2.4.2. Structure prediction, refinement, and validation

115

PSIPRED

(http://bioinf.cs.ucl.ac.uk/psipred/)

[38,39]

and

GalaxyWEB

116

(http://galaxy.seoklab.org/) [40,41] were utilized to predict the secondary and tertiary

117

structure, respectively, of the multi-epitope vaccine construct. The best model was refined

118

with GalaxyWEB [40,41] whereas its visualization was obtained from the VMD software

119

(Version 1.9.3) [32]. The data validation was performed using PROCHECK

120

(https://servicesn.mbi.ucla.edu/PROCHECK/)

121

(https://prosa.services.came.sbg.ac.at/prosa.php) [43].

122

2.4.3. Prediction of conformational BC

[42]

and

ProSA-web

123

Conformational epitopes of the multi-epitope vaccine construct were predicted from

124

Ellipro (http://tools.iedb.org/ellipro/) [44], which represents the protein structure as an

125

ellipsoid and calculates protrusion indexes for protein residues outside of such ellipsoid

126

[44]. Minimum levels of 0.8 and a distance of 6.0 Å were applied. The epitopes were

127

visualized with the VMD software (Version 1.9.3) [32] to illustrate their position and 3D

128

structure.

129

2.4.4. Innate immune receptor-Vaccine interaction: Molecular docking

130

Since TLR4 may serve as a sensor for the recognition of coronaviruses S glycoproteins

131

[34], this germline-encoded pattern recognition receptor was selected for the docking study.

132

The 3D structure of TLR4 was obtained from PDB (accession number: 4G8A). The refined

133

model of the multi-epitope vaccine was used as a ligand. The TLR4‐Vaccine docking

134

simulation and its 3D visualization were performed with Patchdock [31] and VDM [32],

135

respectively.

136

2.4.5. In silico immune response simulations

137

To further characterize the potential immune response of the multi-epitope vaccine,

138

immune simulations were performed using the C-ImmSim server (http://150.146.2.1/C-

139

IMMSIM/index.php) [45]. Three injections were applied four weeks apart as described

140

previously [46]. Furthermore, 12 injections were applied four weeks apart to simulate

141

repeated exposure to potential immunogen. The Simpson index D was used to interpret the

142

diversity of the immune response.

143

2.4.6. Population coverage

144

Global population coverage of the multi-epitope vaccine construct was calculated from

145

IEDB-AR (http://tools.iedb.org/population/) [47,19]. The HLA allele genotypic frequencies

146

available on IEDB-AR were obtained from Allele Frequency Database (AFD)

147

(http://www.allelefrequencies.net/). At present, AFD contains allele frequencies from 115

148

countries and 21 different ethnicities (http://www.allelefrequencies.net/). Those 115

149

countries were selected and the HLA-I and HLA-I interacting alleles predicted in this work

150

were included to perform an HLA combined analysis. The results were shown on a world

151

map using Rstudio software (Version 3.5.3) [48].

152
153

3. Results

154

3.1. Prediction of T cell epitopes

155

A total of 47 T cell epitopes were predicted; however, 8 CTC and 11 THC epitopes were

156

identified as the best (Table 1). These 19 epitopes showed a potent viral antigenicity—

157

ranging from 0.63 to 1.52—and lack of allergenic or toxic residues in their sequences

158

(Table 1). Moreover, THC epitopes were characterized by their potential capability to

159

induce IFN-g (Table 1). Although “EGFNCYFPLQSYGFQ” (E47 in Table 1) could be

160

categorized as a strong potential THC epitope, it was identified as a probable inductor of

161

toxicity. Therefore, this epitope was not included in the amino acid sequence of the multi-

162

epitope vaccine.

163

3.1.1. HLA-I and HLA-II interacting alleles

164

The selected CTC epitopes (Table 1) showed promiscuous affinity by several HLA-I

165

alleles, including A*01:01, A*02:01, A*03:01, A*11:01, A*23:01, A*25:01, A*30:01,

166

A*68:01, A*74:01, B*07:02, B*08:01, B*13:01, B*13:02, B*14:02, B*15:01, B*15:02,

169

C*14:02, C*15:02, C*16:01, and C*17:01. Likewise, the selected THC epitopes (Table 1)

170

showed common interaction with the following HLA-II alleles: DRB1*01:01,

171

DRB1*01:03, DRB1*07:01, DRB1*15:01, DRB1*01:20, DRB3*02:02, DRB4*01:01, and

172

DRB5*01:01.

173

3.2. Prediction of linear BC epitopes

174

A total of 10 linear BC epitopes of varying amino acid lengths were predicted (Table 2).

175

Most of the epitopes showed robust viral antigenicity (≥0.5), as well as, they were

176

identified as non-allergenic and non-toxic (Table 2). However, only 7 epitopes were

177

selected for the vaccine design due to they were predicted simultaneously by 3 different

178

web tools (BCPRED, iBCE-EL, and BepiPred-2.0) (Table 2). Interestingly, overlapping

179

residues were observed between some linear BC and T cell epitopes.

180

3.3. HLA allele-viral peptide interaction: Molecular docking

181

To evaluate the presentation of the best epitopes in the context of HLA, molecular

182

docking simulations were conducted. For this purpose, HLA-C*06:02 and HLA-

183

DRB1*01:01 were chosen as representative alleles.

184

HLA-I and HLA-II alleles were docked with CTC and THC epitopes, respectively, using

185

the Patchdock server, which has been recently applied to successfully dock epitopes from

186

SARS-CoV-2 into immune cell receptors [10]. The HLA allele-viral peptide complexes

187

showed high geometric shape complementarity scores (>6000) [52] similar to controls

188

(Table 3). The inspection on VDM software allowed observing different binding patterns

189

wherein viral peptides rightly interact with the active site residues of the HLA groove in a

190

similar way to control peptides (Fig. 2). Moreover, several viral peptides (e.g., E15 and

191

E33) formed a bulge that projected from their respective HLA allele (Fig. 2B and 2C),

192

which may suggest a more direct interaction with the T cell receptor [18].

195

To design the amino acid sequence of the multi-epitope vaccine, a total of 26 epitopes (8

196

CTC, 11 THC, and 7 LBC epitopes) were organized using several linkers (Fig. 1). This

197

sequence is constituted by 437 amino acid residues (Fig. 1).

198

Of particular note, 6 epitopes selected for the vaccine design (E2, E19, E43, E44, and

199

E45 in Table 1; E10 in Table 2) harbour residues that are usually involved in the interaction

200

between the SARS-CoV-2 S glycoprotein and hACE2 [49-51]. For instance, N501—which

201

is present in the amino acid sequence of E19 (Table 1) and E10 (Table 2)—has been

202

recently described as one of the critical hACE2-binding residues in SARS-CoV-2 [51].

203

The vaccine showed a strong viral antigenicity (0.64), as well as neither allergenic nor

204

toxic residues were observed in its amino acid sequence. Furthermore, the physicochemical

205

properties examined with the ProtParam tool, including molecular weight, theoretical pI,

206

amino acid composition, atomic composition, extinction coefficient, estimated half-life,

207

instability index, aliphatic index, and GRAVY, were computed as conventional results

208

(Table 4).

209

3.4.2. Structure prediction, refinement, and validation

210

The 437 amino acid long vaccine construct was analysed using the PSIPRED server to

211

predict its secondary structure, which identified 316, 70, and 51 amino acids forming coil,

212

helix, and strand regions, respectively (Fig. 3A).

213

The tertiary structure was subjected to refinement using the GalaxyRefine server. The

214

output showed five potential models. Model 1 (Fig. 3B) was classified as the best based on

215

various parameters such as GDT-HA (0.9886), RMSD (0.292), MolProbity (2.364), clash

216

score (24.4), and poor rotamers score (0.3). Therefore, this model was selected for further

217

analysis. In this regard, the Ramachandran plot (Fig. 3C) showed that 86.4% of residues

218

were located in most favoured regions, whereas the remaining residues were observed in

219

additional allowed (11.7%), generously allowed (1.2%), and disallowed (0.6%) regions. In

220

addition, the Z-score value (-2.35) (Fig. 3D) suggests that the vaccine structure is similar to

221

native proteins of comparable size.

222

3.4.3. Prediction of conformational BC epitopes

223

Three conformational BC epitopes (CE) were predicted using Ellipro (Fig. 4). These CE

224

showed high probability scores—CE1: 0.914, CE2: 0.841 and CE3: 0.821, suggesting a

225

considerable accessibility for antibodies (Fig. 4). Likewise, these results also confirm the

226

immunogenic potential of the multi-epitope vaccine construct.

227

3.4.4. TLR4-vaccine model interaction: Molecular docking

228

The output parameters of the TLR4–vaccine complex showed a suitable geometric shape

229

complexity (29.237) and the interface area of the interaction (3271.40). Moreover, Fig. 5

230

clearly showed that the multi-epitope vaccine construct properly occupied the TLR4.

231

3.4.5. Immune response simulations

232

The immune response simulations with the multi-epitope vaccine construct (3 doses

233

given 4 weeks apart) showed cell-mediated and humoral responses. As expected, increased

234

number and activity of Natural Killer (NK) cells—one of the first lines of defence against

235

viruses [18], and macrophages were observed (Fig. 6). Regarding the adaptive immune

236

response, CTC and THC populations showed a proliferative burst, effector cell generation,

237

and a dramatic cell number contraction (Fig. 6). Importantly, IL-2, which is necessary for T

238

cell activation and optimal proliferation [18], was amplified after each dose (Fig. 6).

239

Moreover, the vaccine model increased BC and plasma cell populations, particularly

240

immunoglobulin M (IgM) and IgG1 isotypes (Fig. 6). In this regard, titres of IgM, IgG1,

241

and IgG2 were higher in the secondary and tertiary response compared to primary response

242

(Fig. 6). Of note, immunogen concentrations decreased after antibody response (Fig. 6).

243

Notably, repeated exposure with 12 injections (given 4 weeks apart) increased the IgG1

244

levels and stimulated CTC and THC populations (Fig. S1). Taken together, these results

245

suggest that the multi-epitope vaccine could evoke and maximize both effector responses

246

and immunological memory to SARS-CoV-2.

247

3.4.6. Population coverage

248

To investigate whether the multi-epitope vaccine may be used in different ethnic groups

249

or globally, a population coverage analysis was performed. Remarkably, the multi-epitope

250

vaccine construct showed high global population coverage: 99.69%. For instance, several

251

countries with positive reports of COVID-19 (>6000 cases) [53], obtained the highest

4. Discussion

257

Immunoinformatics represents a valuable tool whereby the limitations in the selection of

258

appropriate antigens and immunodominant epitopes may be overcome [17]. Previous in

259

silico-based reports have shown that the SARS-CoV-2 S glycoprotein contains potential

260

epitopes [8-11]. Therefore, researchers have recently attempted to design epitope-based

261

vaccine candidates against SARS-CoV-2 [10, 11]. Despite these relevant contributions, one

262

group only used T cell epitopes and did not include BC epitopes [10], which are

263

fundamental players in antiviral immune response [18]. The second work, on the other

264

hand, considered several viral membrane proteins, including the S glycoprotein, to

265

identified probable T and BC epitopes [11]. Although the predicted epitopes showed good

266

immunogenic potential, the vaccine does not target S glycoprotein RBM [11]. In the

267

present study, highly potential B and T cell epitopes from the SARS-CoV-2 glycoprotein

268

were predicted and the best selected to design a high-quality multi-epitope vaccine

269

candidate. Remarkably, this vaccine harbours 2 epitopes (E19 in Table 1 and E10 in Table

270

2) that could evoke immune responses against SARS-CoV-2 RBM—the main responsible

271

for virus entry into human cells [4,51], whereas 4 epitopes (E43, E44, E45, and E46 in

272

Table 1) may direct the immune attack against other regions of SARS-CoV-2 RBD. These

273

results are consistent with in vitro data that have demonstrated the antigenicity of the

274

SARS-CoV-2 S glycoprotein [4].

275

The T cell epitopes included in the vaccine sequence accomplish with relevant requisites

276

to design a suitable multi-epitope vaccine candidate. Firstly, they showed a marked

277

antigenicity, immunogenicity, and lack of allergenic or toxic residues. Secondly, the THC

278

epitopes were predicted as potent inductors of IFN-g—a crucial cytokine for CTC

279

activation [18]. Thirdly, both CTC and THC epitopes properly interacted with the groove of

280

HLA-I and HLA-II alleles, respectively, which is in agreement with other computer-based

281

reports [54], thereby suggesting that the T cell epitopes identified and selected in the

282

present study could be successfully presented in the context of HLA molecules.

283

The purpose of an adjuvant is to make a vaccine “detectable” for antigen-presenting

284

cells such as dendritic cells [55]. In this regard, adjuvants approved or in clinical trials

285

(NCT01609257) for virus-like particle-based vaccines are constituted by TLR4 agonists

286

[55]. Here, the TLR4 adjuvant known as RS09 [33] was included in the multi-epitope

287

vaccine sequence. The molecular docking simulation showed that the multi-epitope vaccine

288

rightly interacts with this innate immune receptor in a similar way to previous works [35].

289

Notably, this study shows, by immunoinformatics simulations, the induction of both

290

innate and adaptive responses to SARS-CoV-2. In this regard, NK cell and macrophage

291

activation were detected, as well as high production of typical antibodies (IgM and IgG),

292

cytokines (IFN-g and IL-2), and a proliferative burst of CTC and THC were observed after

293

three injections. The generation and increase of plasma cells were also documented.

294

Furthermore, B and T cell populations decreased along with immunogen levels. These data

295

is comparable to previous investigations that have been focused on vaccine development

296

against Mycobacterium ulcerans [46] and filarial diseases [56], as well as are in agreement,

297

at least partially, with a recent study that demonstrated a positive correlation between

298

robust CD4+ THC responses with anti-SARS-CoV-2 IgG and IgA titres of COVID-19

299

convalescent patients [57]. These immune responses were directed to the SARS-CoV-2 S

300

glycoprotein [57].

301

This work was limited by A) the population coverage analysis did not include some

302

countries, particularly from Africa, Central America, Eastern Europe, and Central Asia.

303

This was mainly due to data not available concerning the HLA allele frequencies.

304

Nevertheless, the highest population coverage was observed in several of the worst-hit

305

countries by COVID-19 (e.g, Brazil, China, France, Italy, Iran, Peru, Spain, USA, etc.)

306

[52]. B) This study did not explore whether the epitopes used for vaccine design are

307

conserved in other beta-coronaviruses. However, former reports have already demonstrated

308

that SARS-CoV-2 shares 79.5% and 50% sequence identity to SARS-CoV and MERS-

309

CoV, respectively [58].

310

In summary, this study provides a novel multi-epitope vaccine built from high potential

311

epitopes derived from the SARS-CoV-2 S glycoprotein. This immunoinformatics study

312

suggests that such multi-epitope vaccine could activate and generate robust humoral and

313

cell-mediated responses in a simultaneous manner against SARS-CoV-2, as well as the

314

population coverage analysis indicates that it could be used globally. However, further

315

rigorous in vitro and in vivo studies are imperative to confirm its immunogenic properties,

316

safety, and efficacy, which—of course—would imply months, even years.
