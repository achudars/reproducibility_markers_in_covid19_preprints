Summary

1

SARS-CoV-2 is a betacoronavirus that is responsible for the COVID-19

Kim et al.

2

pandemic. The genome of SARS-CoV-2 was reported recently, but its

3

transcriptomic architecture is unknown. Utilizing two complementary

4

sequencing techniques, we here present a high-resolution map of the

5

SARS-CoV-2 transcriptome and epitranscriptome. DNA nanoball sequencing

6

shows that the transcriptome is highly complex owing to numerous

7

recombination events, both canonical and noncanonical. In addition to the

8

genomic RNA and subgenomic RNAs common in all coronaviruses,

9

SARS-CoV-2 produces a large number of transcripts encoding unknown ORFs

10

with fusion, deletion, and/or frameshift. Using nanopore direct RNA

11

sequencing, we further find at least 41 RNA modification sites on viral

12

transcripts, with the most frequent motif being AAGAA. Modified RNAs have

13

shorter poly(A) tails than unmodified RNAs, suggesting a link between the

14

internal modification and the 3′ tail. Functional investigation of the unknown

15

ORFs and RNA modifications discovered in this study will open new directions

16

to our understanding of the life cycle and pathogenicity of SARS-CoV-2.

The SARS-CoV-2 transcriptome

Introduction

32

Coronavirus disease 19 (COVID-19) is caused by a novel coronavirus

33

designated as severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2)

34

(Zhou et al., 2020; Zhu et al., 2020). Like other coronaviruses (order Nidovirales,

35

family Coronaviridae, subfamily Coronavirinae), SARS-CoV-2 is an enveloped

36

virus with a positive-sense, single-stranded RNA genome of ~30 kb.

37

SARS-CoV-2 belongs to the genus betacoronavirus, together with SARS-CoV

38

and Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) (with 80% and

39

50% homology, respectively) (Kim et al., 2020; Zhou et al., 2020). Coronaviruses

40

(CoVs) were thought to primarily cause enzootic infections in birds and

41

mammals. But, the recurring outbreaks of SARS, MERS, and now COVID-19

42

have clearly demonstrated the remarkable ability of CoVs to cross species

43

barriers and transmit between humans (Menachery et al., 2017).

44

CoVs carry the largest genomes (26-32 kb) among all RNA virus families

45

(Figure 1). Each viral transcript has a 5′ -cap structure and a 3′ poly(A) tail (Lai

46

and Stohlman, 1981; Yogo et al., 1977). Upon cell entry, the genomic RNA is

47

translated to produce nonstructural proteins (nsps) from two open reading

48

frames (ORFs), ORF1a, and ORF1b. The ORF1a produces polypeptide 1a (pp1a,

49

440-500 kDa) that is cleaved into 11 nsps. The −1 ribosome frameshift occurs

50

immediately upstream of the ORF1a stop codon, which allows continued

51

translation of ORF1b, yielding a large polypeptide (pp1ab, 740-810 kDa) which

52

is cleaved into 16 nsps. The proteolytic cleavage is mediated by viral proteases

53

nsp3 and nsp5 that harbor a papain-like protease domain and a 3C-like protease

54

domain, respectively.

55

The viral genome is also used as the template for replication and

Kim et al.

56

transcription, which is mediated by nsp12 harboring RNA-dependent RNA

57

polymerase (RdRP) activity (Snijder et al., 2016; Sola et al., 2015).

58

Negative-strand RNA intermediates are generated to serve as the templates for

59

the synthesis of positive-sense genomic RNA (gRNA) and subgenomic RNAs

60

(sgRNAs). The gRNA is packaged by the structural proteins to assemble progeny

61

virions. Shorter sgRNAs encode conserved structural proteins (spike protein (S),

Figure 1 | Schematic presentation of the SARS-CoV-2 genome organization, the canonical subgenomic
mRNAs, and the virion structure.
From the full-length genomic RNA (29,903 nt) which also serves as an mRNA, ORF1a and ORF1b are
translated. In addition to the genomic RNA, nine major subgenomic RNAs are produced. The sizes of the
boxes representing small accessory proteins are bigger than the actual size of the ORF for better
visualization. The black box indicates leader sequence. Note that ORF10 is not included here because our
data show no evidence for ORF10 expression.
envelope protein (E), membrane protein (M), and nucleocapsid protein (N)),

63

and several accessory proteins. SARS-CoV-2 is known to have six accessory

64

proteins (3a, 6, 7a, 7b, 8, and 10) according to the current annotation (NCBI

65

Reference Sequence: NC_045512.2). But the ORFs have not yet been

66

experimentally verified for expression. Therefore, it is currently unclear which

67

accessory genes are actually expressed from this compact genome.

68

Each coronaviral RNA contains the common 5′ “leader” sequence of 70-100

Kim et al.

69

nt fused to the “body” sequence from the 3′ end of the genome (Lai and

70

Stohlman, 1981; Sola et al., 2015) (Figure 1). According to the prevailing model,

71

leader-to-body fusion occurs during negative-strand synthesis at short motifs

72

called transcription-regulating sequences (TRSs) that are located immediately

73

adjacent to ORFs (Figure 1). TRSs contain a conserved 6-7 nt core sequence

74

(CS) surrounded by variable sequences. During negative-strand synthesis, RdRP

75

pauses when it crosses a TRS in the body (TRS-B), and switches the template to

The SARS-CoV-2 transcriptome

the TRS in the leader (TRS-L), which results in the leader-body fusion. From

77

the fused negative-strand intermediates, positive-strand mRNAs are transcribed.

78

The replication and transcription mechanism has been studied in other

79

coronaviruses. However, it is unclear whether the general mechanism also

80

applies to SARS-CoV-2 and if there are any unknown components in the

81

SARS-CoV-2 transcriptome. For the development of diagnostic and therapeutic

82

tools and the understanding of this new virus, it is critical to define the

83

organization of the SARS-CoV-2 genome.

84

Deep sequencing technologies offer a powerful means to investigate viral

85

transcriptome. The “sequencing-by-synthesis (SBS)” methods such as the

86

Illumina and MGI platforms confer high accuracy and coverage. But they are

87

limited by short read length (200-400 nt), so the fragmented sequences should

88

be re-assembled computationally, during which the haplotype information is

89

lost. More recently introduced is the nanopore-based direct RNA sequencing

90

(DRS) approach. While nanopore DRS is limited in sequencing accuracy, it

91

enables long-read sequencing, which would be particularly useful for the

92

analysis of long nested CoV transcripts. Moreover, because DRS does not

93

require reverse transcription to generate cDNA, the RNA modification

94

information can be detected directly during sequencing. Numerous RNA

95

modifications have been found to control eukaryotic RNAs and viral RNAs

96

(Williams et al., 2019). Terminal RNA modifications such as RNA tailing also

97

plays a critical role in cellular and viral RNA regulation (Warkocki et al., 2018).

98

In this study, we combined two complementary sequencing approaches, DRS

Kim et al.

99

and SBS. We unambiguously mapped the sgRNAs, ORFs, and TRSs of

100

SARS-CoV-2. Additionally, we found numerous unconventional recombination

101

events that are distinct from canonical TRS-mediated joining. We further

102

discovered RNA modification sites and measured the poly(A) tail length of

103

gRNAs and sgRNAs.

The SARS-CoV-2 transcriptome

Results and Discussion

105

To delineate the SARS-CoV-2 transcriptome, we first performed DRS runs on
a MinION nanopore sequencer using total RNA extracted from Vero cells

107

infected with SARS-CoV-2 (BetaCoV/Korea/KCDC03/2020). The virus was

108

isolated from a patient who was diagnosed with COVID-19 on January 26, 2020,

109

after traveling from Wuhan, China (Kim et al., 2020). We obtained 879,679

110

reads from infected cells (corresponding to a throughput of 1.9 Gb) (Figure 2A).

111

The majority (65.4%) of the reads mapped to SARS-CoV-2, indicating that viral

112

transcripts dominate the transcriptome while the host gene expression is

113

strongly suppressed. Although nanopore DRS has the 3′ bias due to directional

114

sequencing from the 3′ -ends of RNAs, approximately half of the viral reads still

115

′

contained the 5 leader.

116

The SARS-CoV-2 genome was fully covered, missing only 12 nt from the 5′

117

end (Figure 2B). The longest tags (111 reads) correspond to the full-length

118

gRNA (Figure 2B). The coverage of the 3′ side of the viral genome is substantially

119

′

higher than that of the 5 side, which reflects the nested sgRNAs. This is also

120

partly due to the 3′ bias of the directional DRS technique. The presence of the

121

leader sequence (72 nt) in viral RNAs results in a prominent coverage peak at the

122

′

5 end, as expected. We could also clearly detect vertical drops in the coverage,

123

whose positions correspond to the leader-body junction in sgRNAs. All known

124

sgRNAs are supported by DRS reads, with the exception of ORF10 (see below).

125

In addition, we observed unexpected reads reflecting noncanonical

126

recombination events. Such fusion transcripts resulted in the increased coverage
′

127

towards the 5 end (Figure 2B, inner box). Early studies on coronavirus mouse

128

hepatitis virus reported that recombination frequently occurs (Furuya and Lai,

129

1993; Liao and Lai, 1992; Luytjes et al., 1996). Some viral RNAs contain the 5′

130

′

Kim et al.

106

and 3 proximal sequences resulting from “illegitimate” recombination events.

131

To further validate sgRNAs and their junction sites, we performed DNA

132

nanoball sequencing based on the sequencing-by-synthesis principle (DNBseq)

133

and obtained 305,065,029 reads (Figure 2C). The results are overall consistent

134

with the DRS data. The leader-body junctions are frequently sequenced, giving

rise to a sharp peak at the 5′ end in the coverage plot (Figure 2D). The 3′ end

136

exhibits a high coverage as expected for the nested transcripts.

137

The depth of DNB sequencing allowed us to confirm and examine the

138

junctions on an unprecedented scale for a CoV genome. We mapped the 5′ and
′

3 sites at the fused junctions and estimated the recombination frequency by

140

counting the reads spanning the junctions (Figure 3A). The leader represents the

141

most prominent 5′ site, as expected (Figure 3A, red asterisk on the x-axis). The

142

known TRSs are detected as the top 3′ sites (Figure 3A, red dots on the y-axis).

143

These results confirm that SARS-CoV-2 uses the canonical TRS-mediated

144

mechanism for discontinuous transcription to produce major sgRNAs (Figure

145

3B). Quantitative comparison of the junction-spanning reads shows that the N

146

RNA is the most abundantly expressed transcript, followed by S, 7a, 3a, 8, M, E,

147

6, and 7b (Figure 3C). It is important to note that ORF10 is represented by only

148

one read in DNB data (0.000009 % of viral junction-spanning reads) and that it

149

was not supported at all by DRS data. ORF10 does not show significant

150

homology to known proteins. Thus, ORF10 is unlikely to be expressed, and the

151

annotation of ORF10 should be reconsidered. Taken together, SARS-CoV-2

152

expresses nine canonical sgRNAs (S, 3a, E, M, 6, 7a, 7b, 8, and N) together with

153

the gRNA (Figures 1 and 3C).

154

In addition to the canonical sgRNAs with expected structure and length

155

(Figure 3D), our results show many minor recombination sites (Figures 3E-3G,

156

Table S2). There are three main types of such recombinant events. The RNAs in

157

′

Kim et al.

139

the first cluster have the leader combined with the body at unexpected 3 sites in

158

the middle of ORFs or UTRs (Figure 3E, TRS-L-dependent noncanonical

159

recombination; Table S3). The second cluster shows a long-distance fusion

160

between sequences that do not have similarity to the leader (Figure 3F,

161

TRS-L-independent distant recombination). The last group undergoes local

162

recombination, which leads to smaller deletions, mainly in structural and

163

accessory genes, including S (Figure 3G, TRS-L-independent local

164

recombination).

that the left-most bins containing the leader TRS was expanded horizontally on this heatmap to improve

Of note, the junctions in these noncanonical transcripts do not contain a

Kim et al.

166

known TRS-B, indicating that at least some of these transcripts may be

167

generated through a different mechanism(s). It was previously shown in other

168

coronaviruses that transcripts with partial sequences are produced (Furuya and

169

Lai, 1993; Liao and Lai, 1992; Luytjes et al., 1996). These RNAs are considered as

170

parasites that compete for viral proteins, hence referred to as “defective

171

interfering RNAs” (DI-RNAs) (Pathak and Nagy, 2009). Similar sgRNAs have

172

also been described in a recent sequencing analysis on alphacoronavirus

173

HCoV-229E (Viehweger et al., 2019), suggesting this mechanism may be

174

conserved among coronaviruses. While this may be due to erroneous replicase

175

activity, it remains an open question if the noncanonical recombinations have an

176

active role in the viral life cycle and evolution. Although individual RNA species

177

are not abundant, the combined read numbers are often comparable to the levels

178

of accessory transcripts. Most of the RNAs have coding potential to yield

179

proteins. Many transcripts (that belong to the “TRS-L-independent distant”

180

group) encode the upstream part of ORF1a, including nsp1, nsp2, and truncated

181

nsp3, which may change the stoichiometry between nsps (Figure 3F, Table S4).

182

from known viral proteins (Figure 3B). It will be interesting in the future to

186

examine if these unknown ORFs are actually translated and yield functional

187

products.

188

As nanopore DRS is based on single-molecule detection of RNA, it offers a

189

unique opportunity to examine multiple epitranscriptomic features of individual

190

RNA molecules. We recently developed software to measure the length of

191

poly(A) tail from DRS data (Choi and Chang, unpublished). Using this software,

192

we confirm that, like other CoVs, SARS-CoV-2 RNAs carry poly(A) tails

193

(Figures 4A-B). The tail is likely to be critical for both translation and replication.

194

The tail of viral RNAs is 47 nt in median length. The full-length viral RNA has a

195

relatively longer tail than sgRNAs. Notably, sgRNAs have two tail populations: a

196

minor peak at ~30 nt and a major peak at ~45 nt (Figure 4B, arrowheads). Wu

197

and colleagues previously observed that the poly(A) tail length of bovine CoV

198

mRNAs change during infection: from ~45 nt immediately after virus entry to

199

~65 nt at 6-9 h.p.i. and ~30 nt at 120-144 h.p.i. (Wu et al., 2013). Thus, the short

200

tails of ~30 nt observed in this study may represent aged RNAs that are prone to

201

decay. Viral RNAs exhibit a homogenous length distribution, unlike host

202

nuclear genome-encoded mRNAs (Figure 4C). The distribution is similar to that

203

of mitochondrial chromosome-encoded RNAs whose tail is generated by

204

MTPAP (Tomecki et al., 2004). It was recently shown that HCoV-229E nsp8 has

205

an adenylyltransferase activity, which may extend poly(A) tail of viral RNA

206

(Tvarogova et al., 2019). Because poly(A) tail should be constantly attacked by

207

host deadenylases, the regulation of viral RNA tailing is likely to be important

208

for viral end replication.

209

Next, we examined the epitranscriptomic landscape of SARS-CoV-2 by using

Kim et al.

210

the DRS data. Viral RNA modification was first described more than 40 years

211

ago (Gokhale and Horner, 2017). N6-methyladenosine (m6A) is the most widely

212

used modification (Courtney et al., 2017; Gokhale et al., 2016; Krug et al., 1976;

213

Lichinchi et al., 2016; Narayan et al., 1987), but other modifications have also

214

been reported on viral RNAs, including 5-methylcytosine methylation (5mC),

215

2′ -O-methylation (Nm), deamination, and terminal uridylation. In a recent

216

analysis of HCoV-229E using DRS, modification calling suggested frequent

218

control group was included in the analysis, the proposed modification needed

219

validation. To unambiguously investigate the modifications, we generated

220

negative control RNAs by in vitro transcription of the viral sequences and

221

performed a DRS run on these unmodified controls (Figure S1A). The partially

222

overlapping control RNAs are ~2.3 kb or ~4.4 kb each and cover the entire

223

length of the genome (Figure S1B). Detection using pre-trained models reported

224

numerous signal level changes corresponding to 5mC modification, even with

225

the unmodified controls (Figure S1C). We obtained highly comparable results

226

from the viral RNAs from infected cells (Figure S1D), demonstrating that the

227

5mC sites detected without a control may be false positives.

We, however, noticed intriguing differences in the ionic current (called

229

“squiggles”) between negative control and viral transcripts (Figure 5A). At least

41 sites displayed substantial differences (over 20% frequency), indicating

231

potential RNA modifications (Table S5). Notably, some of the sites showed

232

different frequencies depending on the sgRNA species. Figures 5A-5C show an

233

example that is modified more heavily on the S RNA than the N RNA, while

234

Figures S2A-S2C present a site that is modified more frequently on the ORF8

235

RNA compared with the S RNA. Moreover, the dwell time of the modified base

236

is longer than that of the unmodified base (Figure 5D, right), suggesting that the

237

modification interferes with the passing of RNA molecules through the pore.

238

Among the 41 potential modification sites, the most frequently observed
motif is AAGAA (Figures 5E and S2D). The modification sites on the

240

‘AAGAA-like’ motif (including AAGAA and other A/G-rich sequences) are

241

found throughout the viral genome but particularly enriched in genomic

242

positions 28,500-29,500 (Figure 5F). Long viral transcripts (gRNA, S, 3a, E, and

243

M) are more frequently modified than shorter RNAs (6, 7a, 7b, 8, and N) (Figure

244

5G), suggesting a modification mechanism that is specific for certain RNA

245

species.

246

Since DRS allows simultaneous detection of multiple features on individual

Kim et al.

239

247

molecules, we cross-examined the poly(A) tail length and internal modification

248

sites. Interestingly, modified RNA molecules have shorter poly(A) tails than

249

unmodified ones (Figures 5H and S3). These results suggest a link between the

250

internal modification and 3′ end tail. Since poly(A) tail plays an important role

251

in RNA turnover, it is tempting to speculate that the observed internal

252

modification is involved in viral RNA stability control. It is also plausible that

253

RNA modification is a mechanism to evade the host immune response. The type

254

of modification(s) is yet to be identified, although we can exclude

255

METTL3-mediated m6A (for lack of consensus motif RRACH),

256

ADAR-mediated deamination (for lack of A-to-G sequence change in the

257

DNBseq data), and m1A (for lack of the evidence for RT stop). Our finding

258

implicates a hidden layer of CoV regulation. It will be interesting in the future to

259

identify the chemical nature, enzymology, and biological functions of the

260

modification(s).

262

architecture of SARS-CoV-2. Unambiguous mapping of the expressed sgRNAs

263

and ORFs is a prerequisite for the functional investigation of viral proteins,

264

replication mechanism, and host-viral interactions involved in pathogenicity.

265

An in-depth analysis of the joint reads revealed a highly complex landscape of

266

viral RNA synthesis. Like other RNA viruses, CoVs undergo frequent

267

recombination, which may allow rapid evolution to change their host/tissue

268

specificity and drug sensitivity. The ORFs found in this study may serve as

269

accessory proteins that modulate viral replication and host immune response.

270

The RNA modifications may also contribute to viral survival and immune

271

evasion in infected tissues as the innate immune system is known to be less

272

sensitive to RNAs with nucleoside modification (Kariko et al., 2005). It is yet to

273

be examined if the ORFs and RNA modifications are unique to SARS-CoV-2 or

274

conserved in other coronaviruses. Comparative studies on their distribution and

275

functional significance will help us to gain a deeper understanding of

276

SARS-CoV-2 and coronaviruses in general. Our data provide a rich resource

277

and open new directions to investigate the mechanisms underlying the

278

pathogenicity of SARS-CoV-2.

Supplementary Table 2 | Recombination sites detected from junction-spanning reads.
The genomic coordinates in the “5′ site” and “3′ site” point to the 3′ -most and the 5′ -most nucleotides
that survive the recombination event, respectively. “Count” is the number of the junction-spanning reads
that supports the recombination event. “Skip” is the size of the deletion. “5p_before” is the 3′ -most
sequence from the 5′ -side of the recombination event. “5p_after” is the bases immediately following the “5′
site.” The sequence is the first nucleotides of the region that is excluded by the recombination event.
“3p_before” is the last nucleotide sequence of the region that is excluded by the recombination. “3p_after”
is the 5′ -most nucleotides of the 3′ -side of the recombination product.
Supplementary Table 3 | TRS-L-dependent recombination events resulting in noncanonical
leader-body junction (related to Fig. 3E).
This table extends the information for the recombination events using the canonical leader TRS joined
to noncanonical 3′ sites. “Startpos” is the genomic coordinate where the first AUG appears in the resulting
recombination product. “Resultingsequence” shows the sequence near the recombination site with the
nucleotides from the 5′ -side in lowercase, and those from the 3′ -side in uppercase. “Annot_cds” is the name
of an ORF that shares the start codon position with the recombination product by the “first AUG” rule.
“Annot_cds_start” and “annot_cds_end” indicate the interval of the annotated canonical ORF that matches
to the start codon in the recombination product. “Startmatch_name” and “startmatch_offset” show the
canonical ORF that overlaps with the position of the first appearing AUG in the recombination product,
and the distance between the AUG and the start codon position of the ORF. “Stopmatch_name” and
“stopmatch_offset” show the canonical ORF that overlaps with the expected stop codon position in case the
translation starts at the first appearing AUG, and the relative coordinate of the “expected” stop codon

expected to be produced by the first ORF in the recombination product.
Supplementary Table 4 | TRS-L-independent distant recombination events from the 5′ sites located
within the “hot spots” (related to Fig. 3F).
Many distant recombination events do not involve the leader sequence. Instead, the 5’ sites are often
found in “hot spots” near ORFs or nsp2 and nsp3. “Count” indicates the number of reads that share the
same 5′ and 3′ sites. “Skip” is the size of the deletion in the given combination of 5′ and 3′ sites.
“Truncated_prod” is the name of a mature peptide that is truncated by recombination. “Lost_aa” is the
number of amino acids lost from the mature peptide by recombination. “Added_aa” is the number of
amino acids introduced to the potentially truncated product by recombination. By the recombination
event, the sequence indicated in “ctx_orig” turns into the sequence in “ctx_new”.
Supplementary Table 5 | Detected modification sites in sgRNAs.
The “pos” column shows all genomic positions reported to be modified at least 20% in any species of
sgRNA. “Location” indicates the name of ORF or mature peptide that the position codes. The percentage
numbers below the names of sgRNAs are the estimated fraction of modified reads at the position. “Context”
shows the sequence context around the modified bases.

The SARS-CoV-2 transcriptome

Kim et al.

STAR Methods

306

SARS-CoV-2 sample preparation SARS-CoV-2 viral RNA was prepared by

307

extracting total RNA from Vero cells infected with

308

BetaCoV/Korea/KCDC03/2020, at a multiplicity of infection (MOI) of 0.05, and

309

cultured in DMEM supplemented with 2% fetal bovine serum and

310

penicillin-strepamycin. The virus is the fourth passage and not plaque-isolated.

311

Cells were harvested at 24 hours post-infection and washed once with PBS

312

before adding TRIzol. Viral culture was conducted in a biosafety level-3 facility.

313

In vitro transcription Total RNA from SARS-CoV-2-infected Vero cell was

314

extracted by using TRIzol (Invitrogen) followed by DNaseI (Takara) treatment.

315

Reverse transcription (SuperScript IV Reverse Transcriptase [Invitrogen]) was

316

done with virus-specific RT primers. Templates for in vitro transcription were

317

prepared by PCR (Q5® High-Fidelity DNA Polymerase [NEB]) with

318

virus-specific PCR primers followed by in vitro transcription (MEGAscript™ T7

319

Transcription Kit [Invitrogen]). The oligonucleotides used in this study were

320

listed in Table S1.

321

Nanopore direct RNA sequencing For nanopore sequencing on non-infected

322

and SARS-CoV-2-infected Vero cells, each 4 µg of DNase I (Takara)-treated

323

total RNA in 8 µl was used for library preparation following the manufacturer’s

324

instruction (the Oxford Nanopore DRS protocol, SQK-RNA002) with minor

325

adaptations. 20 U of SUPERase-In RNase inhibitor (Ambion, 20 U/µl) was

326

added to both adapter ligation steps. SuperScript IV Reverse Transcriptase

327

(Invitrogen) was adopted instead of SuperScript III, and the reaction time of

328

reverse transcription was lengthened by 2 hours. The library was loaded on

329

FLO-MIN106D flow cell followed by 42 hours sequencing run on MinION

330

device (Oxford Nanopore Technologies). For nanopore sequencing on

331

SARS-CoV-2 RNA fragments by in vitro transcription, the same method was

332

applied except for a total 2 µg of fragment RNAs and 30 minutes reaction time

333

of reverse transcription. The nanopore direct sequencing data were basecalled

334

using guppy 3.4.5 (Oxford Nanopore Technologies) using the high-accuracy

335

model. The sequence reads were aligned to the reference sequence database

The SARS-CoV-2 transcriptome

Kim et al.

composed of the C. sabaeus genome (ENSEMBL release 99), a SARS-CoV-2

337

genome, yeast ENO2 cDNA (YHR174W), and human ribosomal DNA complete

338

repeat unit (GenBank U13369.1) using minimap2 2.17 (Li, 2018) with options

339

“-k 13 -x splice -N 32 -un”. We used the sequence of the Wuhan-Hu-1 strain

340

(GenBank NC_045512.2) as a backbone for the viral reference genome, then

341

corrected the four single nucleotide variants found in

342

BetaCoV/Korea/KCDC03/2020; T4402C, G5062T, C8782T, and T28143C

343

(GISAID). The sequence alignments were further improved by re-mapping the

344

identified viral reads to the viral genome using minimap2 options “-k 8 -w 1

345

--splice -g 30000 -G 30000 -A1 -B2 -O2,24 -E1,0 -C0 -z 400,200 --no-end-flt

--junc-bonus=100 -F 40000 -N 32 --splice-flank=no --max-chain-skip=40 -un

347

--junc-bed=FILE -p 0.7”. Chimeric reads were filtered out according to the flag

348

from minimap2. The mapped reads from canonical sgRNAs were identified

349

using the start and end positions of large deletions ≥ 10000 nt. For a valid

350

assignment to a species of sgRNA, we required that the start position is between

351

55 and 85 in the genomic coordinate. The first AUG in the downstream of the

352

end position of a large deletion was used for identification of the “spliced”

353

product. The dwell time of poly(A) tails were measured using poreplex 0.5.0 (

354

https://github.com/hyeshik/poreplex). For the conversion from a dwell time to a

355

nucleotide length, we divided a poly(A) dwell measurement by 1/30 of the mode

356

of the poly(A) dwell time of the ONT sequencing calibration control which has a

357

30 nt-long poly(A) tail.

358

DNBseq RNA sequencing Total RNA from SARS-CoV-2-infected Vero cell was

359

extracted by using TRIzol (Invitrogen) followed by DNaseI (Takara) treatment.

360

Dynabeads® mRNA Purification Kit (Invitrogen) was applied to 1 µg of total

361

RNA for rRNA depletion. RNA-seq library for 250 bp insert size was constructed

362

following the manufacturer’s instruction (MGIEasy RNA Directional Library

363

Prep Set). The library was loaded on MGISEQ-200RS Sequencing flow cell with

364

MGISEQ-200RS High-throughput Sequencing Kit (PE 100), and the library was

365

run on DNBSEQ-G50RS (paired-end run, 100 × 100 cycles). The sequences

366

from DNBseq were aligned to the reference sequences used in nanopore DRS.

367

We used STAR (Dobin et al., 2013) with many switches to completely turn off

376

Analysis of junction-spanning reads The junction-spanning reads (JSR) were

377

prepared by extracting all large deletion (≥ 20 nt) events from the sequence

378

alignments. [Figure 3A] We counted the number of 5′ and 3′ sites in 100nt-wide

379

′

bins. The red dots that indicate the frequently used 3 sites were identified using

380

the SciPy’s scipy.signals.find_peaks(prominence=2) (Virtanen et al., 2020).

381

[Figures 3B-3G] The JSRs were categorized by the position of 5′ and 3′ site

382

′

positions. A JSR was marked as a leader-to-body junction when the 5 site of the

383

deletion is between 55 and 85. The sgRNA identity and the frame matching were

384

determined by the first AUG position in the downstream sequence of the 3′ site

385

′

for the JSRs that the 5 site is in a region that is annotated as a UTR. For the cases
′

Kim et al.

386

that the 5 site is in a known ORF or an AUG is introduced by recombination,

387

we checked if the concatenated sequence generates a protein product with the

388

same reading frame as a canonical ORF after the 3′ site.

389

Modified base detection and the downstream analyses The DRS reads of the

390

IVT RNAs were downsampled to balance the coverage between different

391

fragments that were split into equal-sized patches. Sampling frequency of a

392

fragment was controlled by the read counts within a 100-nt bin with the lowest

393

coverage in each fragment. We sampled the reads so that the result contain

394

roughly 10,000 reads from every IVT fragment. The viral RNA reads and the

395

downsampled IVT reads were processed for squiggle analyses by ONT tombo

396

1.5 (Stoiber et al., 2017) with a minor tune to improve the sensitivity of sequence

397

alignments (-k8 -w1). The modified base detection was done by using the

398

“model_sample_compare” mode with an option “--sample-only-estimates”

unless otherwise specified. [Figure 5E-5F] The classification of sequence

context near the modified sites was first done by the existence of four

401

consecutive purine bases within 5-nt from the position with the highest

402

modification fraction reported by tombo. Then, the rest were further divided

403

into four groups according to the nucleotide base with the highest modification

404

fraction. [Figures 5H and S3] “Highly modified” sgRNA reads were detected by

405

referring to eight modification sites which were at least 40% modified in any

species of sgRNAs: 28591, 28612, 28653, 28860, 28958, 29016, 29088, 29127. We

407

used the reads that were reported as modified at three or more sites with a

statistic < 0.01 as “highly modified” reads. “Not modified” reads were reported

with the statistic ≥ 0.01 in all eight sites.
