Abstract

20

SARS-CoV-2, a novel coronavirus infecting humans, is responsible for the current COVID-19

21

global pandemic. If several strains could be isolated worldwide, especially for in-vitro drug

22

susceptibility testing and vaccine development, few laboratories routinely isolate SARS-CoV-2.

23

This is due to the fact that the current co-culture strategy is highly time consuming and requires

24

working in a biosafety level 3 laboratory. In this work, we present a new strategy based on high

25

content screening automated microscopy (HCS) allowing large scale isolation of SARS-CoV-2

26

from clinical samples in 1 week. A randomized panel of 104 samples, including 72 tested

27

positive by RT-PCR and 32 tested negative, were processed with our HCS procedure and were

28

compared to the classical isolation procedure. Isolation rate was 43 % with both strategies on

29

RT-PCR positive samples, and was correlated with the initial RNA viral load in the samples,

30

where we obtained a positivity threshold of 27 Ct. Co-culture delays were shorter with HCS

31

strategy, where 80 % of the positive samples were recovered by the third day of co-culture, as

32

compared to only 25 % with the classic strategy. Moreover, only the HCS strategy allowed us to

33

recover all the positive elements after 1 week of co-culture. This system allows rapid and

34

automated screening of clinical samples with minimal operator work load, thus reducing the risks

35

of contamination.

Introduction
An outbreak caused by a novel coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) has broken in late December

39

2019 in Wuhan, China, then spread worldwide and was declared a pandemic by WHO on the

40

12th of March 2020(1),(2),(3). This global health crisis has drawn the attention of the entire

41

scientific community who are working altogether to understand the reason of this outbreak and to

42

find a solution at the levels of rapid diagnosis and effective treatment(4). Several known drugs

43

have been repurposed to treat COVID-19 patients and have shown in-vitro and in-vivo

44

efficiency(5),(6),(7),(8),(9),(10). Moreover, vaccine development is ongoing in several countries

45

around the world(11),(12), in addition to potential plasma therapy(13),(14). Laboratory diagnosis

46

is mainly based on molecular biology using specific RT-PCR systems to detect the virus in

47

clinical samples(15),(16),(17). However, during such pandemics, strain isolation is important, as

48

having the particle represents the key to all in-vitro research such as drug susceptibility testing

49

and vaccine development. Furthermore, culture allows access to all viral genomes since whole

50

genome sequencing techniques performed directly on samples have their limitations in terms of

51

sensitivity.

52

If routine culture was progressively abandoned in most virology laboratories, we believe

53

that isolating as many strains as possible allows to compare genomic sequences with phenotype

54

of infection, in vitro and in vivo. This would help understanding the epidemiological aspects of

55

this illness, its physiopathology and better target treatment and prevention(18). A first

56

application of this strategy was used by our group to evaluate the risk of contagiousness of

57

patients for discharge from infectious diseases ward(19). However, the current co-culture

58

strategy is tedious and time consuming, especially due to the large number of samples to be

59

cultured. During the current COVID-19 outbreak, the samples without any observable

cytopathogenic effects after 1 week of co-culture, were sub-cultured in blind and monitored for 3

61

weeks. The best would be to have an automated system allowing the rapid screening and

62

monitoring of co-cultures at large scale. In previous works, we developed a screening strategy

63

based on high content screening microscopy (HCS) for the isolation of environmental giant

64

viruses in amoeba and the strict intracellular bacterium Coxiella burnetii(20),(21). In this work,

65

we used the same automated high-throughput method and adapted it for SARS-CoV-2 isolation

66

from clinical samples with the objective to discard the negative co-cultures after 1 week and omit

67

blind sub-cultures. Specific algorithms were applied to detect cytopathic effects in co-cultures at

68

high throughput, which eliminates the subjectivity related to manual observations by the

69

laboratory personnel. This strategy exhibited a similar isolation rate, but a lower co-culture delay

70

when compared to the classic technique routinely used for isolation, as we were able to detect all

71

positive co-cultures in one week.

Materials and Methods

73

1.

74

For protocol development, we used Vero E6 cells (ATCC CRL-1586) as cellular support and the

75

locally isolated SARS-Cov-2 strain IHUMI-3. This viral strain was previously isolated in our lab

76

from a nasopharyngeal swab as previously described(6). The viral titer was calculated by the

77

TCID50 method. Briefly, we cultured Vero E6 cells in black 96-well microplates with optical-

78

bottom (Nunc, Thermo Fischer) at a concentration of 2×105 cells/ml and a volume of 200 µl per

79

well, in a transparent MEM medium supplemented with 4% fetal calf serum and 1% glutamine.

80

Plates were incubated for 24 hours at 37°C in a 5 % CO2 atmosphere to allow cell adhesion.

81

Infection was then carried out with 50 µl of the viral stock suspension diluted up to 10-10. The

82

plates were centrifuged for 1 hour at 700 x g and the total volume per well was adjusted to 250

83

µl with culture medium. Uninfected cells were considered negative control.

84

2.

85

DNA staining was performed with NucBlue™ Live ReadyProbes™ reagent (Molecular Probes,

86

Life Technologies, USA). A concentration of 4 ng/ml was used (equivalent to 10 µl per well

87

directly from stock solution) and a different well was stained each day to avoid photo-bleaching

88

and possible cytotoxicity, as previously described(21).

89

Image acquisition and analysis were performed using the automated CellInsight™ CX7 High

90

Content Analysis Platform coupled with an automation system including an Orbitor™ RS

91

Microplate mover and an incubator Cytomat™ 2C-LIN (Thermo Scientific). The HCS Studio 3.1

92

software was used to set up acquisition parameters using a 20x objective (0.45 NA), and to

93

define image analysis. Autofocus was performed on the fluorescence channel of the fluorescent

probe NucBlue (386 nm). This channel served as a primary mask for cell detection and

95

identification. The regions of interest (ROI) were then identified on brightfield images as a

96

Voronoi diagram derived from nuclear masks. Cell debris were removed using area cutoffs. The

97

entire well (80 fields per well) was screened on a daily basis and data were extracted and

98

analyzed in a dedicated application that we recently developed in R Studio® for the detection of

99

the intracellular bacteria, Coxiella burnetii(21). We optimized this application for the detection

100

of cytopathic effects caused by Covid-19.

101

Briefly, a database consisting of negative (uninfected cells) and positive (infected cells) controls

102

was generated. The data were used to define specific features allowing the discrimination

103

between the two groups. The following features were selected: the average, total and variation of

104

the nuclear fluorescence intensity per cell, the nuclear area, the skewness of the brightfield

105

intensity distribution, the kurtosis of the brightfield intensity distribution and the total intensity of

106

the brightfield within the regions of interest (ObjectAvgIntenCh1, ObjectTotalIntenCh1,

107

ObjectVarIntenCh1, ObjectAreaCh1, ROI_SkewIntenCh3, ROI_KurtIntenCh3 and

108

ROI_TotalIntenCh3 respectively). These parameters were used to generate 2 clusters using K-

109

means clustering algorithm and then the percentage of injured cells per well was calculated, as

110

previously described(21). We then compared the percentage of injured cells obtained to the total

111

cell count in each well in order to detect cell lysis (ratio = % injured cells / cell count).

112

3.

113

We applied this strategy for the detection of SARS-CoV-2 in randomly chosen 104 anonymized

114

nasopharyngeal swab samples. Initial RT-PCR ranged from 12 Ct to 34 Ct in 72 samples, and 32

115

samples with negative initial PCR were used as negative controls. Sample preparation and co-

116

culture were performed as previously described(6). Briefly, 500 µl of the sample were processed

into 0.22 µm pore sized centrifugal filter (Merck millipore, Darmstadt, Germany) and

118

centrifuged at 12 000 g for 5 minutes. 50 µl were then inoculated on a monolayer of Vero E6

119

cells cultured in 96-well microplates. A negative control consisting of uninfected cells and a

120

positive control consisting of cells infected with a 10-4 dilution of the IHUMI-3 strain were

121

considered. A centrifugation step (700 x g for 1 h) was performed to enhance the entrance of the

122

virus inside the cells. Plates were then incubated at 37°C and monitored for 7 days to search for

123

cytopathic effects. In parallel, the same samples were processed using the classical isolation

124

strategy based on the manual observation of cytopathic effects under an inverted microscope, in

125

order to validate our strategy(6),(19),(22). For this strategy, co-cultures showing no cythopatic

126

effects after 1 week were sub-cultured at day 7 and day 14 onto a fresh monolayer of cells for a

127

complete observation of 3 weeks.

128

4.

129

Positive co-cultures were processed with both scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and RT-PCR

130

directly from culture supernatant to validate the presence of COVID-19 viral particles. Briefly,

131

the SEM was performed using the SU5000 microscope (Hitachi High-Tech Corporation, Tokyo,

132

Japan) allowing a rapid observation in about10 minutes without time consuming sample

133

preparations(22). RT-PCR protocol was performed as previously described by Amrane et al.

134

targeting the E gene(23). This RT-PCR was applied to wells showing a cytopathic effect to

135

confirm that this effect was due to SARS-CoV-2 and to negative wells to confirm that the lack of

136

cytopathic effect was not due to microscopically undetectable minimal viral growth.

Results

148

Figure 1 represents the fluorescence and brightfield images acquired with the cx7 microscope at

149

days 1 and 6 post infection showing the early stages of infection of SARS-CoV-2 (Figure 1 - a,

150

b) compared to advanced stages of infection and cell lysis (Figure 1 - g, h, i, j, k). Typical

151

cytopathic effects consist of an increasing nuclear fluorescence intensity of the NucBlue

152

fluorescent probe, in addition to nuclear fragmentation. These observations resulted in an

153

increase in the average, total and variation intensity of the nucleus and a decrease in the nuclear

154

area on the fluorescence images. Adding to this, infected cells become round and form

155

aggregates resulting in an increasing total intensity, skewness and kurtosis on the brightfield

156

images. Finally, advanced stages of infection are represented by cell lysis.

157

2.

158

The data extracted from the images were analyzed in the dedicated application in R Studio. The

159

database of negative and positive controls served as training data for the clustering algorithm and

160

a baseline of 2 to 3 % injured cells was predicted in the negative training data compared to a

161

value of 50 to 55 % injured cells in the positive training data. The percentage of injured cells in

162

each condition was predicted and then divided by the total cell count per well. This ratio allowed

163

us to distinguish positive wells, showing cytopathic effects or cell lysis, from the negative

164

control wells consisting of uninfected cells (Figure 2- a). Cytopathic effects were detectable up

165

until the dilution 10-4 after 6 days of culture for the strain IHUMI-3 used in this study, which

166

corresponds to the viral titer obtained by TCID50.

167

Furthermore, the automation system allowed us to monitor co-culture on a daily basis without

168

any intervention from the operators. The Momentum software was used to monitor the

allowing the proper incubation of the plates followed by the automated handling of the screening

171

process at each specified time point.

173

Among the panel of 104 samples processed on the CX7 microscope, 32 samples had a negative

174

initial PCR and were considered controls for system’s sensitivity, and therefore the

175

corresponding co-cultures were negative. Among the remaining 72 samples, we managed to

176

isolate the virus from 31 samples using our automated detection system. The detection delay

177

ranged from 24 hours to 3 days for most samples and was prolonged to 6 days for samples with

178

low viral load. Figure 2-b shows examples of co-culture results obtained with the automated

179

detection system compared to the negative (uninfected cells) and positive (cells infected with the

180

viral strain IHUMI-3) controls.

181

Regarding the classic isolation strategy, 30 viral strains were isolated from the tested panel of

182

samples and the 32 samples with negative initial PCR had negative culture results as well. The

183

majority of strains were recovered after fourth days of co-culture and only few were isolated at

184

earlier stages. Three strains out of 30 were recovered after subcultures, 2 in the second week and

185

1 in the third week of co-culture.

186

A significantly higher percentage of positive samples was observed on a daily basis with the

187

HCS strategy (Figure 3). Moreover, the majority of positive samples were isolated by the third

188

day of co-culture using the HCS strategy, where 80 % positivity was obtained compared to only

189

26 % with the classic strategy (p value < 0.001).

190

To validate our results, positive co-cultures were processed to scanning electron microscopy to

191

confirm the presence of viral particles. We detected viral particles in the supernatant of all

samples that were detected as positive by the HCS strategy. Figure 4 shows an example of

193

particle detection in culture supernatant by SEM. RT-PCR performed on all wells correlated with

194

the results of the microscopy-based detection. We then correlated the isolation rates obtained

195

with both strategies to the initial viral RNA load (Figure 5). We obtained comparable isolation

196

rates with the HCS isolation strategy, as compared with the classic strategy.

197

Then, we correlated the isolation rates obtained with both strategies to the initial viral load (RT-

198

PCR results) in each sample and the results are shown in figure 5. We obtained similar isolation

199

rates with the HCS isolation strategy as well as with the classic strategy. Moreover, we noticed

200

that most of the strains were recovered from samples with an initial viral load lower than 30 Ct

201

with both strategies. Therefore, we calculated the positivity threshold of the isolation rate

202

compared to the initial viral load in the samples using a ROC curve and we obtained a similar

203

positivity threshold of 27 Ct for both isolation strategies.

Discussion
Scientists are facing major challenges in the fight against Covid-19(15). Isolating the

207

virus is a crucial factor, especially during pandemics, since all in-vitro analysis require having

208

the virus(4). Furthermore, the greater the number of strains isolated, the better the understanding

209

of the genetic diversity of this virus, especially since genome sequencing directly from samples

210

is limited to viral load and a very poor genome assembly is obtained when the viral load is

211

greater than 19 Ct (unpublished data). Developing an automated viral isolation technique was

212

thus necessary to overcome the subjective and time consuming manual microscopic

213

observations. In this work, we were able to co-culture a large amount of clinical samples and

214

monitor them with a fully automated system, which reduced the workload and time required

215

from laboratory technicians. The main advantage of this technique is the automation as it allows

216

limiting the risk of exposure or contamination of the personnel, since plate monitoring and data

217

analysis could be carried out from distance, thus avoiding direct contact and manual observations

218

of co-cultures. Similar isolation rates were obtained with both isolation strategies, which

219

validated the efficiency of our new automated system. Moreover, this isolation rate was obtained

220

in 1 week with the HCS strategy without any subcultures, contrary to the classic technique with

221

weekly subcultures for a complete incubation time of 3 weeks. Subsequently, since the loss of

222

cultivability of the virus in samples allows to consider patients at low risk of contamination, it

223

helps in the decision to discharge them from infectious diseases wards(19). Using this HCS

224

isolation strategy allows us to answer this question in one week. This is especially critical at the

225

beginning of an epidemic or when PCR detection systems have to be modified. Thus, this new

226

automated isolation strategy is applicable during the current crisis to recover strains from

227

suspected samples in a safe and rapid way. Further work is underway to use this technique for

large-scale drug susceptibility testing of SARS-CoV-2 strains isolated from patients. And,

229

finally, the algorithms used here could be adapted and applied for the detection and isolation of

230

other viruses from clinical samples in case of known and emerging viral diseases.
