Abstract
Introduction
Viral disease spread by contaminated commonly touched surfaces is a global concern. Silicon nitride, an industrial ceramic that is also used as an implant in spine surgery, has known antibacterial
activity. The mechanism of antibacterial action relates to the hydrolytic release of surface disinfectants. It is hypothesized that silicon nitride can also inactivate the coronavirus SARS-CoV-2.

Methods
SARS-CoV-2 virions were exposed to 15 wt.% aqueous suspensions of silicon nitride, aluminum
nitride, and copper particles. The virus was titrated by the TCD50 method using VeroE6/TMPRSS2
cells, while viral RNA was evaluated by real-time RT-PCR. Immunostaining and Raman spectroscopy were used as additional probes to investigate the cellular responses to virions exposed to the
respective materials.

Results
All three tested materials showed >99% viral inactivation at one and ten minutes of exposure.
Degradation of viral RNA was also observed with all materials. Immunofluorescence testing
showed that silicon nitride-treated virus failed to infect VeroE6/TMPRSS2 cells without damaging
them. In contrast, the copper-treated virus suspension severely damaged the cells due to copper
ion toxicity. Raman spectroscopy indicated differential biochemical cellular changes due to infection and metal toxicity for two of the three materials tested.

Conclusions
Silicon nitride successfully inactivated the SARS-CoV-2 in this study. The mechanism of action
was the hydrolysis-mediated surface release of nitrogen-containing disinfectants. Both aluminum
nitride and copper were also effective in the inactivation of the virus. However, while the former
compound affected the cells, the latter compound had a cytopathic effect. Further studies are
needed to validate these findings and investigate whether silicon nitride can be incorporated into
personal protective equipment and commonly touched surfaces, as a strategy to discourage viral
persistence and disease spread.

1. Introduction
The novel coronavirus, SARS-CoV-2, has led to a worldwide pandemic and raised interest in the
surface-mediated transmission of viral diseases [1–3]. Respiratory aerosols and droplets, and contaminated surfaces facilitate viral spread from person to person leading to recommendations of
social distancing, wearing of masks, hand-washing, and regular surface disinfection. Data suggest
that the SARS-CoV-2 virus can remain viable on copper, plastic, steel, and cardboard surfaces for
4-72 hours after contact, and up to 7-days on surgical masks [4]. Viral persistence on these and
other materials presents a risk for the social and nosocomial propagation of COVID-19, the disease
caused by SARS-CoV-2. Current viral inactivation methods include the surface application of
chemicals, such as a combination of ethanol with hydrogen peroxide or sodium hypochlorite [2].
Irradiation of surfaces with ultraviolet light is another virus disinfection strategy [5]. These and
other proposed antiviral methodologies are ultimately limited by their toxicity to human cells [6,7].
As a practical solution, surfaces that are safe for human contact and capable of spontaneously
inactivating viruses are desirable to control the spread of viral diseases.
Silicon nitride (Si3N4) is a non-oxide ceramic that has been used in many industries since the
1950s. A formulation of Si3N4 is FDA-cleared for use as an intervertebral spinal spacer in cervical
and lumbar spine fusion surgery, with proven long-term safety, efficacy, and biocompatibility.
Clinical data for Si3N4 implants compare favorably with other spine biomaterials, such as allograft,
titanium, and polyetheretherketone [8–13]. A curious finding is that Si3N4 implants have a lower
incidence of bacterial infection (i.e., less than 0.006%) when compared to other implant materials
(2.7% to 18%) [14]. This property reflects the complex surface biochemistry of Si3N4 that elutes
minute amounts of nitrogen, which is converted to ammonia, ammonium, and other reactive nitrogen species (RNS) that inhibit bacteria [15]. A recent investigation also found that viral exposure
to sintered Si3N4 powders in aqueous suspension inactivated H1N1 (Influenza A/Puerto
Rico/8/1934), Feline calicivirus, and Enterovirus (EV-A71) [16]. Based on these findings, it is
hypothesized that Si3N4 may be able to inactivate SARS-CoV-2.
The present study compared the effects of exposing SARS-CoV-2 to aqueous suspensions of Si3N4
and aluminum nitride (AlN) particles and two controls, (i.e., a suspension of copper (Cu) particles
(positive control) and a sham treatment (negative control)). Cu was chosen as a positive control
because of its well-known ability to inactivate a variety of microbes, including viruses [17]. AlN
was included in the testing because, like Si3N4, it is a nitrogen-based compound whose surface
hydrolysis in aqueous solution leads to the elution of ammonia, with an attendant increase in pH.
Since comparable antiviral and antibacterial phenomena are believed to be operative for all nitridebased compounds, AlN was used to provide additional insight into the antipathogenic mechanisms
of nitrogen-containing inorganic materials [18,19].

2. Materials and Methods
Preparation of Test Materials
Si3N4, Cu, and AlN powders were acquired from commercial sources (SINTX Technologies, Inc.,
Salt Lake City, UT USA, FUJIFILM Wako Pure Chemical Corporation, Osaka, Japan, and Tokuyama Co., Yamaguchi, Japan, respectively). Si3N4 powder (nominal composition of 90 wt.%
Si3N4, 6 wt.% Y2O3, and 4 wt.% Al2O3) [20] was prepared by aqueous mixing and spray-drying

of the inorganic constituents, followed by sintering of the spray-dried granules (~1700°C for ~3
h), hot-isostatic pressing (~1600°C, 2 h, 140 MPa in N2), aqueous-based comminution, and freezedrying. The resulting powder had an average particle size of 0.8 ± 1.0 μm. As-received Cu powder
(USP grade 99.5% purity) granules were comminuted to achieve a particle size comparable to the
Si3N4. AlN powder had an average particle size of 1.2 ± 0.6 μm as received, which was comparable
to Si3N4.

Cells and Virus
VeroE6/TMPRSS2 cells (Japanese Collection of Research Biosources Cell Bank, National Institute of Biomedical Innovation, Osaka, Japan) were used in the viral assays [21]. Cells were grown
in Dulbecco’s modified Eagle’s minimum essential medium (DMEM) (Nissui Pharmaceutical Co.
Ltd., Tokyo, Japan) supplemented with G418 disulfate (1 mg/ml), penicillin (100 units/mL), streptomycin (100 μg/mL), 5% fetal bovine serum, and maintained at 37°C in a 5% CO2 / 95% in a
humidified atmosphere. The SARS-CoV-2 (Japan/AI/I- 004/2020; Japan National Institute of Infectious Diseases, Tokyo, Japan) viral stock was propagated using VeroE6/TMPRSS2 cells at
37°C for 2 days.

Viral infection
Fifteen weight percent (15 wt.%) of the Si3N4, Cu, and AlN powders were separately dispersed in
1 mL of PBS(-), followed by the addition of the viral suspension (2 x 105 median tissue culture
infectious dose (TCID50) in 20 μL). Due to the higher density of the Cu powder, its volumetric
fraction was approximately one-third of the Si3N4. Mixing was gently performed at room temperature for 1 min by slow manual rotation or for 10 min using a rotation machine. After exposure,
the powders were pelleted by centrifugation (2400 RPM 2 mins) followed by filtration through a
0.22 μm filter (Hawach Sterile PES Syringe Filter, HAWACH SCIENTIFIC CO., LTD., Xi’an,
China). Supernatants were collected, aliquoted, and subjected to TCID50 assays and real-time RTPCR.

Titration of virus
Experiments were performed in triplicate including sham-treated virus suspension that was not
exposed to any powder. A confluent monolayer of VeroE6/TMPRSS2 cells in a 96-well plate was
inoculated with 50 μL/well of each virus suspension in a tenfold serial dilution with 0.5% FBS
DMEM (i.e., maintenance medium). Viral adsorption at 37°C for 1 h was made with gently shaking every 10 min. Afterward, 50 μL/well of the maintenance medium was added. The plate was
incubated at 37°C in a 5% CO2 /95% humidified atmosphere for 4 days. The cytopathic effect
(CPE) of the infected cells was observed under a phase-contrast microscope. The cells were subsequently fixed by adding 10 μL/well of glutaraldehyde followed by staining with 0.5% crystal
violet. The TCID50 was calculated according to the Reed-Muench method [22].

Viral RNA Assay
After exposure to the powders, 140 μL of the supernatants were used for viral RNA extraction.
RNA was also extracted from the surfaces of the centrifuged and filtered powders. RNA purification was performed by using a QIAamp Viral RNA Mini kit (QIAGEN, Germantown, MD, USA).
An aliquot of 16 μL of isolated RNA was reverse-transcribed using ReverTra Ace® qPCR RT
Master Mix (Toyobo, Shiga, Japan). Quantitative real-time PCR was performed using a Step-One
Plus Real-Time PCR system (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA, USA) and two sets of

primers/probes specific for viral N gene.
Set 1: (forward primer, 5’-CACATTGGCACCCGCAATC-3’; reverse primer, 5’-GAGGAACGAGAAGAGGCTTG-3’’;probe, 5’-(FAM) ACTTCCTCAAGGAACAACATTGCCA (BHQ) 3’); and Set 2: (forward primer, 5’-AAATTTTGGGGACCAGGAAC-3’; reverse primer, 5’-TGGCAGCTGTGTAGGTCAAC-3’’; probe, 5’-(FAM) ATGTCGCGCATTGGCATGGA (BHQ) 3’).
Each 20 μL reaction mixture contained 4 μL of cDNA, 8.8 pmol of each primer, 2.4 pmol of the
probe, and 10 μL GoTaq Probe qPCR master mix (Promega, Madison, WI, USA). The amplification protocol consisted of 50 cycles of denaturation at 95°C for 3 s and annealing and extension at
60°C for 20 s.

Immunofluorescence
Vero E6/TMPRSS2 cells on cover glass were inoculated with 200 μL of virus supernatant. After
viral adsorption at 37°C for 1 h, the cells were incubated with the maintenance medium in a CO2
incubator for 7 h. For the detection of infected cells, they were washed with TBS (20 mM TrisHCl pH 7.5, 150 mM NaCl) and fixed with 4% PFA for 10 min at room temperature (RT) followed
by membrane permeabilization with 0.1% Triton X in TBS for 5 min at RT. The cells were blocked
with 2% skim milk in TBS for 60 min at RT and stained with anti-SARS Coronavirus envelope
(Rabbit) antibody (Dilution =1:100) (ProSci Inc., Poway, CA, USA) for 60 min at RT. After washing with a buffer, cells were incubated with an Alexa 594 Goat Anti- Rabbit IgG (H+L) (1:500)
(Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA, USA) and Alexa 488 Phalloidin (1:50) (Thermo Fisher
Scientific, Waltham, MA, USA) for 60 min at RT in the dark. ProLongTM Diamond Antifade
Mountant with DAPI (Thermo Fisher Scientific) was used as a mounting medium. The staining
was observed under a fluorescent microscope BZX710 (Keyence, Osaka, Japan). The total cells,
Phalloidin-staining cells, and protein-expressing cells were counted using the Keyence BZ-X Analyzer.

Raman Spectroscopy Assay
Vero E6/TMPRSS2 cells were infected with 200 μL of each virus suspension on glass sites. After
viral adsorption at 37°C for 1 h, the infected cells were incubated with the maintenance medium
in a CO2 incubator for 4 h and fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde for 10 min at RT. After washing
with distilled water twice, infected cells were air-dried and in situ analyzed using a highly sensitive
Raman spectroscope (LabRAM HR800, Horiba/Jobin-Yvon, Kyoto, Japan) with a 20× optical
lens. It operated in microscopic measurement mode with confocal imaging in two dimensions. A
holographic notch filter within the optical circuit was used to efficiently achieve a spectral resolution of 1.5 cm-1via a 532 nm excitation source operating at 10 mW. Raman emissions were monitored using a single monochromator connected to an air-cooled charge-coupled device (CCD) detector (Andor DV420-OE322; 1024 × 256 pixels). The acquisition time was fixed at 10 s. Thirty
spectra were collected and averaged for each analysis time-point. Raman spectra were deconvoluted into Gaussian–Lorentzian sub-bands using commercially available software (LabSpec 4.02,
Horiba/Jobin-Yvon, Kyoto, Japan).

Statistical Analysis
The Student's t-test determined statistical significance for n=3 and at a p-value of 0.01 using Prism
software (GraphPad, San Diego, CA USA).

3. Results
Median Tissue Culture Infection Dose
TCID50 assay results for the 15 wt.% Si3N4, Cu, and AlN powders are shown in Figure 1. Inactivation times of 1 and 10 mins are shown in Fig. 1(a)~(b) and Fig. 1(c)~(d), respectively. Relative
to the negative control, all three powders were effective in inactivating SARS-CoV-2 virions
(>99%) for the two exposure times.

Figure 1. Inactivation of SARS-CoV-2 by nitride powders; virus suspensions
were treated with 15 wt.% Cu, AlN, and Si3N4 powders in an aqueous medium
at room temperature for 1- and 10-min. The control virus was treated identically
without the addition of any powder. After light centrifugation and filtration,
supernatants were subjected to TCID50 assay. The Reed-Muench method was
used to determine the virus titers. TCID50/50 μL (a)/(b) and % reduction (c)/(d)
are shown for virus inactivation times of 1 and 10 min, respectively. Statistics
are given in the inset according to unpaired two-tailed Student’s t-test (n=3).

RNA Fragmentation
To examine whether viral RNA was fragmented from exposure to the powders, RT-PCR tests were
conducted on the viral N gene sequence. The results are shown in Fig. 2(a)~(b) and (c)~(d) for 1and 10-min exposures, respectively. Again, in comparison to the supernatant of the negative control that was not exposed to any powder, almost complete fragmentation of the RNA was observed
for Cu while significant damage was caused by AlN and to a lesser extent by Si3N4. After 10 min
exposure to the powders, substantial cleavage of the RNA was seen for all three materials. While
Cu still showed the most fragmentation, Si3N4 demonstrated similar effectiveness, and AlN was
essentially identical to the 1-min exposure condition.
Viral RNA was virtually undetectable for all three materials from the pelleted powders after 1 min
of exposure (cf. Fig. 2(a)~(b)). This result suggests that the decrease of viral RNA in the supernatant was not because of adherence of the RNA to the powders, but rather due to degradation.

Figure 2. Viral RNA underwent severe degradation after exposure to copper or nitride particles.
In (a) and (b), virus suspensions were exposed to Cu, AlN, and Si3N4 powders for 1 min, and
viral RNA in supernatants and on particles were evaluated using viral N gene “set 1” and “set
2” primers, respectively. Data collected on supernatants and pellet samples are given in comparison with the amount of viral N gene RNA in suspension that was left untreated. In (c) and (d),
results of RT-PCR tests for supernatants after 10 min exposure of virus suspension to Cu, AlN,
and Si3N4 powders for viral N gene “set 1” and “set 2” primers are shown, respectively. Statistics
are given in the inset according to unpaired two-tailed Student’s t-test (n=3).

Immunofluorescence Testing
Immunofluorescence imaging using anti-SARS coronavirus envelope antibody (red), Phalloidin
that stains F-actin in viable cells (green), and DAPI for cell nuclear staining (blue) was then used
to confirm the TCID50 assay and gene fragmentation results. Figures 3(a)~(d) show fluorescence

micrographs representative of the VeroE6/TMPRSS2 cell populations that were inoculated with
supernatants of (a) unexposed virions (i.e., negative control) and 10-min-exposed virions of (b)
Si3N4, (c) AlN, and (d) Cu. Figure 3(e) shows cells that were not inoculated with the virus (labeled
as “sham-infected” cells. The red-fluorescent signals in the negative control (Fig. 3(a)) demonstrated that the virus had infected the cells and viral protein was synthesized. This contrasts with
the sham-infected cells (Fig. 3(e)), which did not show any evidence of expression of the viral
protein.

Figure 3. Si3N4 suppressed virus infection without affecting cell viability, whereas Cu killed the
cells. VeroE6/TMPRSS2 cells were inoculated with (a) unexposed virions, and virions 10-minexposed to (b) Si3N4, (c) AlN, and (d) Cu, followed by culture for 7 h. In (e), non-inoculated
cells (labeled as “sham-infected” cells) were also prepared and imaged for comparison. After
fixation, cells were stained with anti-SARS coronavirus envelope antibody (red), Phalloidin to
visualize F-actin (green), and DAPI to stain nuclei (blue). Fluorescence micrographs are shown,
which are representative of n=3 samples.
Remarkably, cells inoculated with supernatants from Si3N4 and, to a lesser extent, from AlN
demonstrated near-normal viability with few infections. Conversely, cells inoculated with the Cu
supernatant were essentially dead as suggested by a complete lack of F-actin (Fig. 3(d)). This
indicates that cell death did not result from viral infection but from toxic effects of intracellular
free Cu ions [23]. Quantification of the fluorescent microscopic results from Figure 3 is provided
in Figure 4, assuming that the Phalloidin-positive cells were viable and anti-SARS envelope antibody-stained cells were infected. These data demonstrate that about 35% of the viable
VeroE6/TMPRSS2 cells from the negative control were infected, whereas only 2% and 8% of cells
inoculated with supernatants from Si3N4 and AlN were infected, respectively.

Figure 4. Fluorescently labeled and non-labeled cells were counted on fluorescence micrographs. Values were calculated as follows: % infected cells/total
cells = (number of the cells stained with anti-SARS coronavirus envelope antibody) / (number of nuclei stained with DAPI) x 100; and, % viable cells/total
cells = (number of the cells stained with Phalloidin) / (number of nuclei stained
with DAPI) x 100. Data are representative of n=3 samples. * and ** are p<0.05
and 0.01, respectively, by unpaired two-tailed Student’s t-test (n=3); n.s. = nonsignificant

Raman Spectroscopy
Raman spectroscopy examined VeroE6/TMPRSS2 cells exposed to the various supernatants to
assess biochemical cellular changes due to infection and ionic (i.e., Cu and Al) toxicity. Figure 5
shows Raman spectra in the frequency range 700-900 cm-1 for (a) uninfected VeroE6/TMPRSS2
cells, and cells inoculated with supernatants containing virions exposed for 10 mins to (b) Si3N4,
(c) AlN, (d) Cu (positive control), and (e) no antiviral compounds (negative control). Of fundamental importance are the vibrational bands of ring breathing and H-scissoring of the indole ring
of tryptophan (at 756 and 875 cm-1 [24], labeled as T1 and T2, respectively). Tryptophan plays a
vital role in protein synthesis and the generation of molecules for various immunological functions.
Its stereoisomers serve to anchor proteins within the cell membrane [25] and its catabolites possess
immunosuppressive functions [26]. The catabolism of tryptophan is triggered by a viral infection.
This occurs via the enzymatic activity of indoleamine-2,3-dioxygenase (IDO) which protects the
host cells from an over-reactive immune response. IDO reduces tryptophan to kynurenine and then
to N’-formyl-kynurenine. An increase in IDO activity depletes tryptophan [27]. Consequently, the
intensity of the tryptophan bands (T1 and T2) is an indicator of these biochemical changes. Except
for the Cu- treated sample, the data presented in Fig. 5(f) show an exponential decline in the combined tryptophan bands that correlates with the fraction of infected cells. (The chemical structure
of N’-formyl-kynurenine is given in the inset for clarity.) The anomaly for copper provides further
evidence of its toxicity. The VeroE6/TMPRSS2 cells consumed tryptophan to reduce Cu2+ and

stabilize it as Cu+ [28].

Figure 5. Raman spectra of: (a) uninfected cells (i.e., unexposed to virions), and

AlN, and (d) Cu; in (e), Raman spectrum of cells infected by unexposed virions

three possible conformations of tyrosine-based peptides that can justify the disappearance of ring vibrations in tyrosine (Ty2 band) upon chelation of Cu(II)
ions.
The Raman signals due to ring-stretching vibrations of adenine, cytosine, guanine, and thymine
were found at 725, 795, 680, and 748 cm-1, and are labeled as A, Cy1, G, and Th, respectively, in
Fig. 5) [29]. These bands were preserved after virus exposure. However, there was an anomaly for
lines representative of tyrosine at 642 and 832 cm-1 labeled as Ty1 and Ty2, respectively [30] for
cells infected with Cu-exposed virions. The ring-breathing band Ty2 of tyrosine was very weak
compared to the other samples (cf. Fig. 5(d) with (b)). Conversely, the C-C bond-related Ty1 signal
remained strong. This suggests that the aromatic ring of tyrosine chelated the Cu ions [31]. This

explains why only the tyrosine ring-breathing mode was reduced while the C-C signal remained
unaltered. Three possible Cu(II) chelating conformations in tyrosine are given in Fig. 5(g) [31,32].
For VeroE6/TMPRSS2 cells exposed to virions treated with AlN (Fig. 5(c)), the tryptophan T1 and
T2 bands were preserved, but the bands at 615 and ~700 cm-1 due to ring bending in DNA cytosine
(labeled as Cy2 and Cy3, respectively, in Fig. 5) almost vanished [29]. Their disappearance is due
to either progressive internucleosomal DNA cleavage or from the formation of complexes, and
both are related to toxicity [33,34]. The loss of the cytosine signals is interpreted as a toxic effect
by Al ions, although it is far less critical than copper. Al3+interacts with carbonyl O and/or N ring
donors in nucleotide bases [35,36] and selectively binds to the backbone of the PO2 group and/or
to the guanine N-7 site of the G-C base pairs by chelation [37,38].
Unlike exposure of the VeroE6/TMPRSS2 cells to Cu and AlN supernatants, which resulted in
moderate to severe toxicity, Si3N4 invoked no modifications of tryptophan, tyrosine, and cytosine.
The morphology of the spectrum for the Si3N4 viral supernatant closely matched that of the uninfected sham suspension (cf. Figs. 5(a) and (b)).

4. Discussion
The persistence of human coronaviruses on common materials (e.g., metal, plastic, paper, and
fabric) and touch surfaces (e.g., knobs, handles, railings, tables, and desktops) can contribute to
the nosocomial and social spread of disease [39,40]. Warnes et al. reported that at room temperature with 30%-40% humidity, the pathogenic human coronavirus 229E (HuCoV-229E) remained
infectious in a lung cell model after at least 5 days of persistent viability on a variety of materials,
such as Teflon, polyvinyl chloride, ceramic tile, glass, stainless steel, and silicone rubber [3]. These
investigators also showed rapid HuCoV-229E inactivation (within a few minutes) for simulated
fingertip contamination on Cu surfaces. Cu ion release and the generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) were involved in viral inactivation; and increased contact time with copper and brass
surfaces led to greater non-specific fragmentation of viral RNA, indicating irreversible viral inactivation [3]. More recently, Doremalen et al. showed surface stability of both SARS-CoV-1 and
SARS-CoV-2 virus on plastic, cardboard, stainless steel, and even Cu surfaces for 4~72 hours after
application [41]. While breathable N95-rated masks can capture particulates before they can be
inhaled, SARS-CoV-2 virus particles remain active in mask filters for up to 7 days [4]. Contact
killing of viruses, such as observed on Cu surfaces is, therefore, receiving renewed interest as a
disease mitigation strategy [17].
The present work is the first to show that compounds capable of endogenous nitrogen-release, such
as Si3N4 and AlN, can inactivate the SARS-CoV-2 virus at least as effectively as Cu. These results
suggest that multiple antiviral mechanisms may be operative, such as RNA fragmentation, and in
the case of Cu, direct metal ion toxicity; but while Cu and AlN supernatants demonstrated strong
and partial cellular lysis, respectively, Si3N4 provoked no metabolic alterations. The Raman spectrum of VeroE6/TMPRSS2 cells exposed to the Si3N4 viral supernatant was like that of the uninfected sham. These findings indicate that while Si3N4, Cu, and AlN were all capable of inactivating
the SARS-CoV-2 virus, Si3N4 was the safest compound for the tested cell model.
These data on SARS-CoV-2 are consistent with a recent investigation that showed rapid

inactivation of three single-strand RNA viruses (H1N1 (Influenza A/Puerto Rico/8/1934), Feline
calicivirus, and Enterovirus (EV-A71) upon exposure to aqueous suspensions of powdered 15
wt.% Si3N4 [16]. The antiviral effect in this prior study was related to the electrical attraction (including “binding competitive” to an envelope glycoprotein hemagglutinin in the case of influenza
virus) and viral RNA fragmentation by reactive nitrogen species (RNS). These phenomena are due
to the slow and controlled elution of nitrogen from Si3N4’s surface, which forms ammonia (NH3)
and ammonium (NH4+) moieties coupled with the release of free electrons and negatively charged
silanols in aqueous solution.
In the context of SARS-CoV-2 viral inactivation, two important aspects of Si3N4’s surface chemistry play fundamental roles: (i) the similarity between the protonated amino groups, SiOH–NH3+
at the surface of Si3N4 and the N-terminal of lysine, C–NH3+ on the virus; and, (ii) the elution of
gaseous ammonia due to Si3N4 hydrolysis. A schematic representation of the interaction between
SARS-CoV-2 and the Si3N4 surface is given in Fig. 6 (central panel). The similarity is depicted in
the left panel of this figure. It triggers an extremely effective “binding competitive” approach to
SARS-CoV-2 inactivation which stems from several successful other examples such as Hepatitis
B [42] and Influenza A [43]. The strong antiviral effect of eluted (gaseous) NH3 is due to its penetration of the virions and its reaction with the RNA backbone. The RNA undergoes alkaline transesterification through the hydrolysis of its phosphodiester bonds [44]. RNA phosphodiester bond
cleavage is schematically depicted in the right panel of Fig. 6. The RT-PCR and fluorescence
microscopy results of the present study suggest contributions from both mechanisms to the inactivation of SARS-CoV-2, consistent with earlier work [16]. While additional experiments are ongoing to confirm the proposed mechanisms of inactivation, the TCID50 results shown in Fig. 1 and
the RT-PCR data of Fig. 2 for viral RNA harvested from either the supernatant or the Si3N4 particles provide important information about these mechanisms. Although >99% inactivation was
achieved after exposure to Si3N4 for 1 min, (Fig. 1(b)), only partial viral RNA fragmentation was
observed for the supernatant (Fig. 2(a)) while RNA harvested from the Si3N4 particles (Fig. 2(b))
was essentially fully fragmented. This suggests that the mechanism of inactivation for Si3N4, as
depicted in the left panel of Fig. 6, had successive events of “competitive binding” and ammonia
poisoning – a kind of “catch and kill” scenario. The complete RNA fragmentation at 10 min exposure to Si3N4 suggests that nitrogen elution is a key process that triggers a cascade of reactions,
which result in virus inactivation (cf. right panel in Fig. 6).
Note that the antiviral effectiveness of Si3N4 was comparable to Cu [41]. While Cu is an essential
trace element for human health and an electron donor/acceptor for several key enzymes by altering
redox states between Cu+ and Cu2+ [45], these properties can also cause cellular damage [17]. Its
use as an antiviral agent is limited by allergic dermatitis [46], hypersensitivity [47], and multiorgan dysfunction [48].
In contrast, the safety of Si3N4 as a permanently implanted material during spine fusion surgery is
well established by experimental and clinical data. These observations are consistent with previous
studies for Si3N4 spine implants made from the same composition. Si3N4 is well known for its
capabilities as an industrial material [48]. Load-bearing Si3N4 prosthetic hip bearings and spinal
fusion implants were initially developed because of the superior strength and toughness of Si3N4
[50]. Later studies showed other properties of Si3N4 that are favored in designing orthopaedic implants, such as enhanced osteoconductivity [51–54] and bacteriostasis [14,55–60]. Taken together,

these data suggest that Si3N4’s surface chemistry, previously known to contribute concurrent upregulation of osteogenic activity and prevention of bacterial adhesion and biofilm formation, is
also quite effective against viruses. Sintered powders of Si3N4 have been incorporated into other
materials, such as polymers [61,62], other ceramics [63], and bioglass [64,65] to create composite
structures that maintain the index osteogenic and antibacterial properties of monolithic Si3N4.
Three-dimensional additive deposition of Si3N4 could, at least in theory, enable the manufacture
of protective surfaces in health care that reduce fomite-mediated transmission of microbial disease
[66].

Figure 6. Schematic model illustrating: a chemical and electrical charge similarity between the
protonated amine groups, Si–NH3+, at the surface of Si3N4 and the N-terminal of lysine, C–NH3+
in cells (left panel); and, the interaction of SARS-CoV-2 viruses with the charged molecular
species at the surface of Si3N4 (specifically, at protonated amines charging plus) and the eluted
species NH3/NH4+ (central panel). The eluted N leaves 3+ charged vacancies on the solid surface
(violet-colored sites), which stem together with negatively charged silanols. The three-step process leading to RNA backbone cleavage by the eluted nitrogen species (namely, deprotonation
of 2’-hydroxyl groups, formation of a transient pentaphosphate, and cleavage of the phosphodiester bond in the RNA backbone by alkaline transesterification through hydrolysis) is
shown in the right panel. Note that the similarity between the protonated amine and N-terminal
of lysine might trigger an extremely effective “binding competitive” mechanism for SARSCoV-2 virion inactivation, while eluted ammonia fatally degrades the virion RNA in a combined
“catch and kill” effect.
Incorporation of Si3N4 particles into the fabric of personal protective equipment, such as face
masks, protective gowns, and surgical drapes could contribute to health workers as well as patient
safety. Further studies and testing are necessary to corroborate our findings and to establish the
antiviral attributes of Si3N4 composites and coatings.

5. Conclusions
In summary, it was shown that Si3N4 inactivates the SARS-CoV-2 virus in a matter of minutes
following exposure. Similar results with AlN suggest that the mechanism of action is shared with
other nitrogen-based compounds that release trace amounts of surface disinfectants slowly and for
the long-term. These data may prove useful in designing products and strategies to mitigate the
spread of viral diseases.
