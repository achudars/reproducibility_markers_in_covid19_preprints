ABSTRACT

12

A novel coronavirus, SARS-CoV-2, has caused a pandemic of COVID-19. The

13

evolutionary trend of the virus genome may have implications for infection control policy

14

but remains obscure. We introduce an estimation of fold change of translational

15

efficiency based on synonymous variant sites to characterize the adaptation of the virus to

16

hosts. The increased translational efficiency of the M and N genes suggests that the

17

population of SARS-CoV-2 benefits from mutations toward favored codons, while the

18

ORF1ab gene has slightly decreased the translational efficiency. In the coding region of

19

the ORF1ab gene upstream of the -1 frameshift site, the decreasing of the translational

20

efficiency has been weakening parallel to the growth of the epidemic, indicating

21

inhibition of synthesis of RNA-dependent RNA polymerase and promotion of replication

22

of the genome. Such an evolutionary trend suggests that multiple infections increased

23

virulence in the absence of social distancing.

INTRODUCTION

26

Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), a previously unknown

27

coronavirus, has caused the pandemic of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) since

28

December 2019(1-4). Coronaviruses are positive-sense single-stranded RNA viruses with

29

envelopes. The reference genome of SARS-CoV-2 (NCBI accession NC_045512) has

30

29,903 nucleotides (nt) containing ORF1ab (also known as NSP, non-structural protein),

31

S (surface or spike), E (envelope), M (membrane or matrix), N (nucleocapsid), and other

32

seven putative open reading frames (ORFs)(2, 3). Comparisons between genomes of

33

SARS-CoV-2 and related viruses have revealed many important insights about the origin

34

of SARS-CoV-2(5-8), but there are few studies on how the genome of SARS-CoV-2 will

35

evolve in the initial stage of the pandemic, which may have implications for infection

36

control policy (9).

37

Codon usage of viral genes is subject to selection pressures imposed by the gene

38

translation machinery of hosts (10, 11). Spontaneous mutation, fine-tuning of translation

39

kinetics, and evasion of immune recognition together shape the evolutionary trend of

40

codon usage (12). Traditional methods based on relative synonymous codon usage

41

(RSCU)(13, 14) count the frequencies of codons of virus genes and evaluate the

42

adaptation to the hosts. However, the sparsity of single nucleotide variants (SNVs) in

43

genomes of SARS-CoV-2 precludes the traditional methods, which were designed for

44

comparison between distant species, from extracting the subtle trend. Here, we introduce

45

a method based on fold change of translational efficiency (FCTE), which accumulates the

46

effects of synonymous SNV distributed sparsely in the genome of SARS-CoV-2 and

47

characterize the adaptation to hosts in the epidemic in China.

48

RESULTS

49

Density of SNV in the coding regions of SARS-CoV-2

50

In 12 ORFs of SARS-CoV-2, there are on average only 0.021 nonsynonymous sites and

51

0.012 synonymous sites per 1000 nt per genome (Fig. 1A). The numbers of synonymous

52

and nonsynonymous sites in a coding region are both correlated with the length of the

53

coding region (Fig. 1B). Compare to the average mutation density, ORF1ab:A, which is

54

the coding region of the ORF1ab gene upstream of the -1 frameshift site, contains slightly

55

more synonymous sites, while ORF1ab:B, which is downstrem of the -1 frameshift site,

56

contains less synonymous sites.

57

FCTE of synonymous mutation

58

FCTE measures the effect of mutation on the translation of the residing gene. We

59

estimated FCTE by the fold change of codon usage frequencies of the codon pair before

60

and after a synonymous mutation (Table S1). The codon usage frequency was calibrated

61

by the codon frequency averaged over a repertoire of genes weighted by their expression

62

levels in the type II alveolar (AT2) cells of lung tissue, which is probably the target cells

63

of SARS-CoV-2(15). Two topologies of phylogenetic trees of the genomes of SARS-

64

CoV-2 were examined. The first topology is star-like, in which the central ancestor is the

65

consensus sequence (Fig. 2A). The second topology is a maximum likelihood tree rooted

66

at the earliest collected genome, in which a mutation is defined as a pair of codon states

67

in the parent and child nodes (Fig. S1, Fig. 2B).

68

FCTE of mutations were grouped by the residing coding regions and the effects of

69

mutations on the translation were evaluated. The Wilcoxon tests yield almost the same p

70

values, pseudomedians, and nonparametric 95% confidence intervals for a coding region

71

considered in different topologies, suggesting that FCTE is insensitive to the topologies

72

of the phylogenetic trees (Fig. 2, C and D). Despite of the ORF6 and ORF7b genes which

73

have no synonymous sites, evolutionary stability of translational efficiency of the S,

74

ORF3a, E, ORF7a, ORF8, and ORF10 genes withstands the Wilcoxon tests. For the M

75

and N genes, the pseudomedians of log2 FCTE are 0.45 and 0.68, respectively, suggesting

76

that during the evolution in the epidemic, the population of SARS-CoV-2 benefits from

77

mutations toward codons favored by the hosts, which possibly accelerate the translation

78

of these genes. In the ORF1ab gene, synonymous sites have evolved toward unfavored

79

codons, especially in the ORF1ab:A fragment.

80

Evolutionary trends of ORF1ab

81

To demonstrate the relationship between log2 FCTE of mutations and the collection times

82

of the genomes in China, we fitted linear models to mutations in the ORF1ab:A and

83

ORF1ab:B fragments and the full-length ORF1ab gene (Fig. 3). The evolutionary trend of

84

the ORF1ab:A fragment is parallel to the growth of the epidemic (Fig. 3A). The

85

ORF1ab:B fragment shows an evolutionary trend opposite to the ORF1ab:A fragment. A

86

summation of ORF1ab:A and ORF1ab:B, however, obscures the evolutionary trend of

87

the full-length ORF1ab. Examined in context of the maximum likelihood tree rooted at

88

the earliest collected genome, the opposite evolutionary trends of ORF1ab:A and

89

ORF1ab:B are even significant, i.e., the p values of the fitted linear models are both

90

below 0.05 and the correlation coefficients get larger (Fig. 3B).

91

Estimation of FCTE for average lung tissue

92

We estimated FCTE by codon usage frequencies calibrated for average lung tissue (Table

93

S1). The values of codon usage frequencies are similar to those for the AT2 cells. The

94

FCTE of genes (Fig. S2, A, B, E, and F) and the evolutionary trend of the two fragments

95

of ORF1ab (Fig. S3, A and B) are similar to previous results calibrated for the AT2 cells,

96

except that the statistical tests against the evolutionary tendency of the N gene and the

97

evolutionary trend of ORF1ab:A become non-significant (Fig. S2, E and F, and Fig. S3B).

98

We also estimated FCTE by codon usage frequencies calibrated for human genes without

99

weighting (16). Although the values of codon usage frequencies are similar to those for

100

the AT2 cells and for average lung tissue, the statistical tests against the evolutionary

101

tendency of the M and N gene and the evolutionary trend of ORF1ab:A are non-

102

significant (Fig. S2, G and H, and Fig. S3D).

103

DISCUSSION

104

Usage of synonymous codons is non-random and non-uniform, the so-called codon bias,

105

the extend of which varies among genes and species (17). Codon bias distinguishes

106

expression levels of genes(13, 18). Codon usage of the viral genes might be subject to

107

selection pressures imposed by the gene translation machinery of the host, because the

108

virus relies on ribosomes and tRNAs of the host cells(12). For human, genes encoding

109

tRNA of various codons are scattered throughout all but the Y chromosome. Relative

110

tRNA abundance, as a result of the number of tRNA genes and the expression levels of

111

these tRNA genes, have been proved correlated significantly to the codon usage of highly

112

expressed genes in a tissue-specific manner(19). Since we do not have the tRNA

113

abundance data for lung tissues, we estimate the change of translational efficiency by the

114

change of codon usage in expressed genes in the AT2 cells and in average lung tissue.

115

Although such an estimation may be even more suitable for evaluation of adaptation of

116

virus genome, because the codon usage frequency also reflects the stability of

117

interactions between mRNA and anticodon in addition to tRNA abundance(12), an direct

118

measurement of tRNA abundance may help to further address various effects of

119

translation kinetics.

120

FCTE in the M and N genes confirm the adaptation of the genome of SARS-CoV-2 to the

121

target tissue (12, 20). Translation products of the M and N genes, both the most abundant

122

structural proteins, interact with the genomic RNA intimately in the viral replication and

123

virion packaging (21, 22). By contrast, synonymous sites in the S gene suggest no

124

tendency of translational efficiency, which can be explained by the fact that the S protein

125

plays no roles in the replication and only a passive role in the packaging. Selection

126

pressure detected in the M and N genes may nullify previous studies on the virus

127

evolution based on the nonsynonymous-to-synonymous site ratio (Ka/Ks test), though

128

speculations on the evolution of the S gene still holds.

129

The ORF1ab gene contains a ribosomal -1 frameshift site (Fig. 1A)(23). When the

130

frameshifting is urged, the product is the ORF1ab protein, which can be further processed

131

to produce RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp). The newly generated RdRp

132

protein starts synthesizing the complementary strand from the 3' end of the genomic RNA

133

and disrupts long distance pairing of RNA secondary structure, preventing the

134

frameshifting in later translation(24). So the ribosome will encounter a stop codon soon

135

and the product is the ORF1a protein contains no RdRp. By such a mechanism the virus

136

encourages RdRp to replicate the genomic RNA which is free of hindering ribosomes.

137

Although synonymous site may changing the RNA secondary structure(23), we observed

138

only one synonymous site appeared in the stem-loop regions overlapped with the

139

ORF1ab gene in one genome(20). A tendency of mutation to rare codons shown by the

140

negative value of log2 FCTE of the ORF1ab:A fragment (Fig. 2, C and D) imply that

141

SARS-CoV-2 has slowed down the translation and enhanced the -1 frameshifting,

142

producing redundant RdRp and distracting virus replication. According to the SIR

143

(susceptible-infected-recovered) epidemiological model, such a tendency may be

144

evolutionarily beneficial to the virus when the distraction of virus replication assists

145

immune evasion or reduces the mortality rate of the hosts, but is essentially evolutionarily

146

unfavored if there were multiple infections and competition (25). In such cases, the

147

genome will be cheated by peers without rare codons in the ORF1ab:A fragment, which

148

produce few RdRp proteins and replicate their genomic RNA with redundant RdRp

149

produced by the cheatee. Parallel to the growth of the epidemic(4) which might increase

150

the possibility of multiple infections, the tendency of mutation toward rare codons in the

151

ORF1ab:A region was weakening in the SARS-CoV-2 epidemic in China (Fig. 3B).

152

Hinged by the fine-tuning of FCTE of the ORF1ab:A region, multiple infections break

153

the balance between RdRp production and genome replication, and may drive the

154

evolution of efficient replication. Because high abundance of virus in an infected host

155

increases the virulence and delays the host curing the infection(25), prevention against

156

multiple infection seems to be a precondition for taming the virus, may provide a new

157

theoretical basis for social distancing in addition to reducing the infected population (26).

158

MATERIALS AND METHODS

159

Codon usage frequency in the AT2 cells and in lung

160

The codon usage frequency was calibrated by the averaged frequency of codons in a

161

repertoire of genes weighted by the expression levels. SARS-CoV-2 mainly infects lung

162

tissue, and probably targets the type II alveolar (AT2) cells(15). A dataset of single-cell

163

transcriptome of human lung tissue (GEO: GSE122960)(27) was re-analysis with R

164

package Seurat version 3.1.4(28) following a previous study(15). Briefly, high-quality

165

cells from eight donor lung biopsies were extracted, which have 200 to 6,000 detected

166

genes and their mitochondrial gene content was <10%, and genes detected in less than

167

three cells were discarded. The gene-cell matrices from eight donor lung biopsies were

168

integrated by SCT normalization method with 2000 anchor genes. By a shared 20-nearest

169

neighbor graph constructed with the first 30 principle components, the cells were

170

clustered at a resolution of 0.15. The AT2 cluster was identified by comparing the marker

171

genes found by the function FindAllMarkers() to marker genes reported by Reyfman et

172

al.(27) For each AT2 cell, the frequency of codons in high-quality cells were counted

173

according to coding DNA sequences of GRCh38.84 provided by ENSEMBL(29). Codon

174

usage frequency in an AT2 cell was calculated by the frequency of codons averaged

175

among genes weighted by the expression levels. Codon usage frequency in all AT2 cells

176

was averaged and used in subsequent analysis.

177

In addition, we also calculated codon usage frequency for the average lung tissue. A

178

dataset of the expression level of transcripts measured as TPM in lung tissue was

179

downloaded from GTEx portal (version 8)(30). The corresponding transcript sequences

180

were obtained from GENCODE version 26(31). Codon usage frequency in a biopsy was

181

calculated by the averaged frequency of codons weighted by the expression levels. Codon

182

usage frequency in lung tissue was averaged over 578 biopsies, of which the autolysis

183

score was 0 or 1, the donor was 20 to 59 years old, and the death Hardy Scale was 1 or 2.

184

Multiple sequence alignment and phylogenetic analysis

185

We downloaded 623 sequences from GISAID’s EpiCoV™ (http://www.gisaid.org, last

186

visit on 13 March 2020, External Data S1), and obtained the sequence and annotations of

187

the reference genome of SARS-CoV-2 from NCBI (accession: NC_045512) (1). A

188

multiple sequence alignment (MSA) of 516 genome sequences (sequences of more than

189

29000 nt) was built using MUSCLE version 3.8.31(32) with default setting. The MSA

190

was trimmed, removing nucleotides preceding the first ORF (ORF1ab) and following the

191

last ORF (ORF10). For quality control, we discarded genomes of which the collection

192

date was ambiguous or the sequence contained any gaps or more than one unresolved

193

nucleotide (symbol “N”), which also included genomes collected from pangolins and bats.

194

The refined MSA consists of 317 sequences.

195

A maximum likelihood phylogenetic tree of the 317 sequences was built using RAxML-

196

NG version 0.9.0(33) with GTR+G substitution model and bootstrapping with MRE-

197

based convergence criterion up to 1000 replicates. The tree was essentially unrooted, and

198

we rooted the tree at the earliest collected sample (EPI_ISL_402123) (Fig. S1).

199

Synonymous triplet sites

200

Codon triplets on 12 ORFs and two fragments of ORF1ab, the fragments of ORF1ab:A

201

and ORF1ab:B, totally 14 coding regions were examined (Fig. 1). In the 12 ORFs, 366

202

SNV triplet sites among 317 genomes distribute in the coding regions uniformly (Fig.

203

1A). The numbers of nonsynonymous and synonymous sites in a coding region are both

204

correlated with the length of the coding region (Fig. 1B).

205

In columns of the MSA of a coding region, the frequency of codons was counted. For a

206

synonymous triplet site, the states before and after a mutation were defined by two

207

topologies of the phylogenetic tree of the virus genomes. The first topology was star-like,

208

in which all 317 genomes as nodes were individually connected to the root, which was

209

the consensus sequence of the 317 genomes. A pair of states of a synonymous site before

210

and after the mutation was the consensus codon versus the minority codon, which was the

211

codon in a few virus genomes different from the consensus. Identical minority codons in

212

different genomes were counted separately as pairs of states of the mutation. Minority

213

codons that contained any partial ambiguity symbols were neglected. The star-like

214

topology might blur the evolutionary trend, because it counted descendant of a

215

synonymous mutation several times.

216

The second topology of the phylogenetic tree of the virus genomes was a maximum

217

likelihood tree rooted at the earliest collected genome (Fig. S1). For a synonymous triplet

218

site, the maximum likelihood ancestor states in internal nodes of the tree were

219

reconstructed using R package phangorn version 2.5.5 (34). Pairs of states of a

220

synonymous site before and after the mutation were defined for edges whose two ends

221

had different codons, i.e., the sum of absolute difference of reconstructed probability of

222

states of codons was greater than 1. The ancestral and mutational states of the edge were

223

the codon of the parent and the child nodes, respectively. The number of descendants of

224

the child node indicates the prosperity of the mutation.

225

Fold change of translational efficiency (FCTE)

226

FCTE characterizes the tendency of codon usage bias in coding regions. In this study, we

227

estimated FCTE by the fold change of codon usage frequency before and after a

228

synonymous mutation (Fig. 2, A and B). Synonymous sites of a coding region were

229

grouped by the residing coding regions, and we performed a one-sample exact Wilcoxon

230

test to see if translational efficiency of the coding region was evolutionary stable (Fig. 2,

231

C and D).

232

We plotted log2 FCTE of mutations in the ORF1ab gene against collection times of the

233

virus genomes. For displaying the parallel development of FCTE of mutations with

234

epidemic (Fig. 3), we extracted from World Health Organization's report on COVID-19

235

the epidemic curve of clinical diagnosed cases, which include laboratory confirmed cases,

236

in Wuhan (4).

237

In addition to the FCTE estimated by codon usage frequency of AT2 cells, we also

238

calculated the FCTE by codon usage frequency for average lung tissue and for all human

239

genes without weighting (Fig. S2 and S3).

240

Statistical Analysis

241

We implemented scripts for finding synonymous triplet sites and calculating FCTE with

242

R version 3.6.2. To evaluate the evolutionary stability of the translational efficiency of a

243

coding region, synonymous sites of the coding region were grouped by the residing

244

coding regions, and a one-sample exact Wilcoxon test was performed to see if the

245

distribution of the logarithm to base 2 (log2) of FCTE of a region was symmetric about

246

zero. Along with the Wilcoxon tests, pseudomedians and the nonparametric 95%

247

confidence intervals were reported except for the M gene, of which the small sample size

248

precluded the estimation of a 95% confidence interval (Fig. 2, C and D). To demonstrate

249

the evolutionary trend of translational efficiency of the ORF1ab gene, the mutations were

fitted by linear models. We reported the correlation coefficients (R2) of the linear models

251

and performed F-tests to show the overall significance (Fig. 3).
