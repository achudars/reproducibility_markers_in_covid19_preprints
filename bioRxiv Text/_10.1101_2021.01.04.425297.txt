Abstract
Coronaviruses are a major infectious disease threat, and include the zoonotic-origin human
pathogens SARS-CoV-2, SARS-CoV, and MERS-CoV (SARS-2, SARS-1, and MERS). Entry of
coronaviruses into host cells is mediated by the spike (S) protein. In our previous ESR studies, the
local membrane ordering effect of the fusion peptide (FP) of various viral glycoproteins including
the S of SARS-1 and MERS has been consistently observed. We previously determined that the
sequence immediately downstream from the S2’ cleavage site is the bona fide SARS-1 FP. In this
study, we used sequence alignment to identify the SARS-2 FP, and studied its membrane ordering
effect. Although there are only three residue difference, SARS-2 FP induces even greater
membrane ordering than SARS-1 FP, possibly due to its greater hydrophobicity. This may be a
reason that SARS-2 is better able to infect host cells. In addition, the membrane binding enthalpy
for SARS-2 is greater. Both the membrane ordering of SARS-2 and SARS-1 FPs are dependent
on Ca2+, but that of SARS-2 shows a greater response to the presence of Ca2+. Both FPs bind two
Ca2+ ions as does SARS-1 FP, but the two Ca2+ binding sites of SARS-2 exhibit greater
cooperativity. This Ca2+ dependence by the SARS-2 FP is very ion-specific. These results show
that Ca2+ is an important regulator that interacts with the SARS-2 FP and thus plays a significant
role in SARS-2 viral entry. This could lead to therapeutic solutions that either target the FP-calcium
interaction or block the Ca2+ channel.

Coronaviruses (CoVs) are a major infectious disease threat for humans and animals; examples
include SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV, and SARS-CoV-21 (SARS-1, MERS and SARS-2 for
simplicity). The pandemic outbreaks of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) in 2003 and
Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS) in 2012 caused 774 and 624 deaths worldwide
respectively1. SARS-2 is the pathogen of the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, which has severely
harmed our public health, economy and social life. The study of SARS-2 is one of the central
agendas in an effort to combat the pandemic.
Glycoproteins located on the viral envelope are required to mediate the viral entry into the host
cells and it is a major pathogenicity determinant2,3. The viral spike protein (S) is such a CoV
glycoprotein. Like SARS-1 and MERS, the S protein of SARS-2 consists of S1 and S2 subunits.
The two major steps in viral entry are 1) receptor binding, in which the S1 subunit recognizes a
receptor on the host cell membrane, e.g., ACE2, and attaches the virus to the host cell, followed
by 2) membrane fusion, in which the S2 subunit mediates the viral envelop membrane and the host
membrane fusing together and releasing the virion into the host cell. Membrane fusion is a required
stage in viral entry4; thus, the blocking of this membrane fusion could be an objective leading to
vaccines and therapies to combat COVID-195. The major region of S that interacts with lipid
bilayers of the host is called the “fusion peptide” (FP). The FP is critical for membrane fusion, as
it inserts into the host lipid bilayer upon activation of the fusion process, perturbing the membrane
structure, and initiating the membrane fusion.
Knowledge of the structure and function of the S of SARS-2 is thus important in order to better
understand the process of viral transmission, its mechanism and for the development of medical
countermeasures (including vaccines, inhibitory peptides, and drugs). The FP is highly conserved
across the diverse CoV family, so it serves as a desirable potential target. Although the S protein
is categorized as a class I viral fusion protein, it differs in several ways from a typical class I viral
fusion protein. Whereas other class I viral fusion proteins such as influenza and HIV glycoproteins
are activated via cleavage by host cell proteases at a single site directly adjacent to the fusion
peptide, coronaviruses have two distinct cleavage sites (S1/S2 and S2’) that can be activated by a
much wider range of proteases, with FP function able to be modulated by changes in the cleavage
site position relative to the FP. This gives coronaviruses unique flexibility in their ability to invade
new cell types, tissues, and host species.
Unlike most other class I viral fusion proteins there is no crystal structure of intact S, severely
limiting our mechanistic understanding of coronavirus fusion. While the basic structure of the S
of SARS and SARS-2 can be revealed using cryo-EM techniques6–8 and part of the SARS-2 S2
subunit has been solved by X-ray crystallography9,10, many structural and functional aspects
remain undetermined, especially since the active form of FPs (i.e. associated with membranes) is
generally not determined in the crystallographic structure as they are hydrophobic and intrinsically
disordered. ESR is a useful technique to study the effect of FPs on the membrane structure with
implications for the mechanism leading to membrane fusion. It can also be used to determine the

peptide structure in the membrane in the form of Pulse-Dipolar ESR11,12 and Power Saturation
ESR13.
Previously, we used phospholipid (PC) spin labels to detect the perturbation of the membrane by
viral FP and TMD14–20. We have shown that a wide range of viral FPs induce local membrane
ordering, while their inactive mutants do not. We have interpreted this as associated with
dehydration induced by the insertion of active FP15,17,21. We also found that this membrane
ordering effect can be used as a criterion to identify the FP, as in the case of the gametic fusogen
HAP220. It was also used to identify the bona fide SARS-1 FP as the region immediately following
the S2’ cleavage site, since the two other candidates do not induce local membrane ordering as
efficiently. In the same study, we showed that the SARS-1 FP consists of FP1 and FP2 domains
and that the activity of SARS-1 FP is Ca2+ dependent, with its FP1 and FP2 each binding one Ca2+
ion.18 Based on that finding, we proposed a bipartite model for the SARS-1 FP (fig 1A). We
showed that the MERS-CoV FP also has FP1 and FP2 domains and its activity is also Ca2+
dependent, but only FP1 binds one Ca2+ ion22. This Ca2+ dependent fashion is also found in the
Ebolavirus (EBOV) FP case. 19 In this study we apply the same methodology on the SARS-2 FP
and compare it with the SARS-1 and MERS FP.
RESULTS
Peptide Cloning and Expression
We previously identified the bona fide SARS-1 FP23 as the sequence that immediately downstream
of the S2’ cleavage site. Based on the sequence alignment, we hypothesize that the homologous
sequence on the SARS-2 S protein is the bona fide SARS-2 FP as well. We planned to test this by
examining its membrane ordering effect as the criterion as before. We previously cloned the
SARS-1 FP gene into a pET41 expression vector. In order to speed our research, we decided to
generate the SARS-2 FP from this SARS-1 FP clone. As showed in Figure 1C, three residues are
different between the SARS-1 FP and SARS-2 FP. Therefore, we have designed the primers and
performed point mutagenesis on these three sites to generates the SARS-2 FP clone. The peptide
was expressed in E. Coli and purified. Fig. 2A shows the SDS-PAGE gel of the fractions collected
from His-tag column. The size of the peptide is correct. The combined fraction was further purified
using size-exclusion chromatography. The size of the peptide was further validated by mass
spectroscopy. All the data presented in this study are from this expressed version. We received
synthesized SARS-2 FP from Biomatik USA LLC (Wilmington, DE) at a later time and have
repeated some key experiments (CD, ESR and ITC) and found that the results between the
expressed and synthesized ones are nearly identical. We used POPC/POPG/Chol=3/1/1 as the
model membrane system. POPG is an anionic lipid and the POPC/POPG mixture is widely used
in other fusion peptide research.24,25

To determine whether the SARS-2 FP interacts with membrane, circular dichroism (CD)
spectroscopy was used to determine the secondary structures of the peptides in solution and in
membranes, which allows us to compare the structural transitions occurring between these two
environments. As shown in fig. 2B, whereas the FP exhibits mostly a random coil structure in
solution, it adopts a mixture of alpha-helix, beta-sheet and random-coil secondary structures in the
presence of small unilamellar vesicles (SUVs) composed of POPC/POPG/Chol=3/1/1 and 1mM
CaCl2 at pH 5. Here, we used SUVs instead of multilamellar lipid vesicles (MLVs) or large
unilamellar vesicles (LUV) because MLVs and LUVs are too large for CD spectroscopy, since
they would cause scattering and a noisy signal. We measured the CD spectra for SARS-1 FP under
the same conditions, and found them similar to those of the SARS-2 FP, though the helical content
of the SARS-2 FP is slightly greater in the membranes (27.6% for SARS-1, and 29.5% for SARS2). To test the effect of pH on the secondary structure, we measured the CD spectra at pH5 and
pH7. As shown in Fig 2B, the pH has little effect on the secondary structure of the SARS-2 FP in
both the presence and absence of SUVs with 1 mM Ca2+. The structure in membranes consists of
29% alpha helix and 7% beta strand. To test the effect of Ca2+ on the secondary structure, we
increased the Ca2+ concentration from 0 to 3 mM, and we found that the alpha helical contents of
the SARS-2 FP increases from 18% to 35%, saturating around 2mM (cf. Fig 2C and D), which are
for SUV’s and pH5. To identify the source of helical increase, we synthesized separately the FP1
domain and the FP2 domain and repeated the CD experiments. As shown in Fig 2E and 2F, FP1
has a higher percentage of alpha helical structure than beta strand, while FP2 has the opposite.
This result is consistent with the newly published structural model of SARS-2 FP using molecular
dynamics26. The presence of Ca2+ promotes the formation of alpha helix in FP1 but promotes the
formation of beta strand in FP2. Thus, the CD spectra show that the SARS-2 FP is affected by
binding to SUV membranes and Ca2+ has an overall effect of aiding the development of its
secondary structure.
SARS-2 FP Increases Membrane Ordering
The ESR signal of the spin labels attached to the lipids in membrane bilayers is sensitive to the
local environment. Four spin labels were used: DPPTC has a tempo-choline headgroup and the
spin is sensitive to changes of environment at the headgroup region; 5PC, 10PC and 14PC have a
doxyl group in the C5, C10 or C14 position respectively of the acyl chain (Fig. 1B), and they are
sensitive to the changes of local environment in the hydrophobic acyl chain region at the different
depths. Using the NLSL software based on the MOMD model 27,28, the order parameter of the spin
can be extracted, which is a direct measure of the local ordering of the membrane. Thus, the effect
of peptide binding on the structure of the membrane can be monitored. These four spin-labeled
lipids have been used in previous studies, and their ability to detect changes in membrane structure
has been validated 21,29. Our previous studies examined the effect of various viral FPs, including
those of influenza virus 14,17, HIV 16, Dengue Virus 20, Ebolavirus(EBOV)19, SARS-118, and
MERS22, as well as the FP of the ancestral eukaryotic gamete fusion protein HAP2 20. All of these

peptides were found to induce membrane ordering in the headgroup region as well as in the shallow
hydrophobic region of bilayers (i.e., 5PC).
We used multilamellar vesicles (MLVs) in our ESR study as they can be much more concentrated
than small unilamellar vesicles (SUVs) which greatly enhances the ESR signal. Furthermore, the
use of MLVs is consistent with our previous studies 16,17,20. As shown in fig. 3A, for the MLVs
composed of POPC/POPG/Chol=3/1/1, when the peptide:lipid ratio (P/L ratio) of FP increases
from 0 to 5 mol%, the order parameter S0 of DPPTC increases significantly from 0.44 to 0.49 at
pH 5 and in the presence of 1mM Ca2+ (with the effect of varying the Ca2+ concentration described
in the next subsection). The increase of the S0 is similar to the effect of influenza FP as we have
previously shown 14–18,20,22. The membrane order of 5PC also significantly increases from 0.53 to
0.65 at pH 5 when the P/L ratio increases (fig. 3B). The perturbation of the FP to the lipid bilayers
exists down to 10 PC, although the effect is not as large (from 0.32 to 0.35, fig 3C). There is
virtually no effect on the S0 of 14PC (cf, fig. 3D). The pH seems not to have a substantial effect
from a comparison of results at pH5 and pH7, however acidification does boost the effect modestly
(fig 3E). To show that the ordering effect is sequence-specific, we synthesized a peptide that has
the same residues as the SARS-2 FP but in a shuffled order as a control. As shown in fig 3E, the
shuffled-sequence peptide does not affect the membrane order at all. Clearly, the sequence of the
FP is very important for its membrane ordering activity.
We also compared the effect of the SARS-2 FP to the SARS-1 FP and the MERS FP. As shown
in figs. 3A and 3B, the shape of the S-curves of the SARS-2 and the SARS-1 FPs are similar in
that they both saturate at around 2% P/L ratio, while the shape of the curve of the MERS FP is
quite different in that it does not saturated even at 5% P/L ratio. It is worth mentioning that the 5%
P/L ratio is very large in a natural scenario and that is why we did not increase the concentration
further in our experiments. In an effort to quantify our results, we fit the S0 vs P/L ratio curves for
DPPTC (fig 3A) and 5PC (fig 3B) using the logistic function
with
fixed S0,min and flexible S0,max , and also extracted the X50 and p from the fittings. The X50
represents the P/L ratio for the FP to reach its half maximum effect, and the p value might be
viewed as the cooperativity of the peptide when it induces membrane ordering. We compare the
Max ΔS0, X50 and p values for the three CoV FP (Tables 1A and 1B, for DPPTC and 5PC
respectively). We find that the maximal effect of the SARS-2 FP is greater than that of the SARSFP (0.051 vs 0.039 for DPPTC and 0.12 vs 0.09 for 5PC) which is again greater than that of the
MERS FP. The X50 values of the SARS-2 and SARS-1 FPs are almost the same (0.26 and 0.29 for
DPPTC and 0.23 and 0.22 for 5PC), and they are both significantly smaller than that of the MERS
FP (0.60 and 1.14 for DPPTC and 5PC, respectively). The p values for the SARS-2 FP are smaller
than those for the SARS-1 FP but greater than those for the MERS FP. In conclusion, the SARS2 fusion peptide shows a greater membrane ordering effect than does the SARS-1 FP and the
MERS FP.
The SARS-2 FP-Induced Membrane Ordering Is Calcium Dependent

We have previously found that the EBOV19, SARS-118 and MERS22 FPs perturb the membrane
structures in a Ca2+ dependent fashion. Because of the similarity between the SARS-1 and SARS2 FPs, we expected to observe this Ca2+ dependency in the SARS-2 FP as well. For comparison
we prepared a “calcium-free” buffer by not adding Ca2+ and instead adding 1 mM of the chelating
agent EGTA to further remove traces of Ca2+. As shown in Figs 3A and B, the membrane ordering
effects of the SARS-2 FP is suppressed. The small increase of S0 when the P/L ratio increases, we
call “basal activity” for the SARS-2 FP, but this is insignificant compared to that in the presence
of Ca2+.
In order to further examine the effects of Ca2+ on FP-inducing membrane ordering, we maintained
the P/L ratio of the FP at a constant 1 mol%, and measured the order parameter S0 with increasing
calcium concentrations ranging from 0 to 3.0 mM (fig. 3F); the highest calcium concentration used
here is much higher than the extracellular concentration of Ca2+ in human adult lungs (ca. 1.3 mM)
30
. The increase in S0 affected by the presence of both the FPs and the Ca2+; so, we generated a
ΔS0-Ca2+ concentration plot, where ΔS0= S0 (membrane with 1% FP) − S0 (membrane without FP)
vs. Ca2+ concentration. This subtraction cancels any membrane ordering induced just by Ca2+, with
the ΔS0 at each Ca2+ concentration representing only the contribution of Ca2+ interacting with the
FPs.
As shown in fig. 3F, Ca2+ increases the ΔS0 of all three CoV FPs. However, while the response
pattern to the Ca2+ concentration is again similar within the SARS FPs, it is different from that of
the MERS FP. We fit the ΔS0 vs Ca2+ concentration curves with the Hill equation
∆𝑆𝑆0 =

∆𝑆𝑆0,𝑚𝑚𝑚𝑚𝑚𝑚 −∆𝑆𝑆0,𝑚𝑚𝑚𝑚𝑚𝑚
1+(𝑋𝑋/𝑋𝑋50 )𝑝𝑝

+ ∆𝑆𝑆0,𝑚𝑚𝑚𝑚𝑚𝑚

with fixed ΔS0,min and flexible ΔS0,max (Table 2), where X50 is the
Ca concentration that reaches 50% effectiveness, and the p value is the Hill slope interpreted as
the cooperativity of the Ca2+ binding to the FP. While the X50 of the SARS-2 and SARS-1 FP are
close (0.42 mM and 0.39 mM, respectively), the X50 of the MERS FP is much larger (2.85 mM).
The Hill slopes for SARS-2 and SARS FP are 1.67 and 1.30 respectively, indicating a positive
cooperative binding of Ca2+ to the FP, while the Hill slope for the MERS-FP (0.90) is appears not
to be cooperative. We have shown previously that the SARS-1 FP binds two Ca2+ ions, each on
FP1 and FP218, and the MERS FP binds only one Ca2+ ion, possibly on FP122. The difference
between the Hill slopes appears to reflect this difference.

Enthalpy Changes of FP-Membrane Interactions
The importance of Ca2+ can be further studied by comparing membrane binding enthalpies of FPs
as measured by isothermal titration calorimetry (ITC) in the presence and absence of Ca2+. In this
experiment, small amounts of peptide were injected into a reaction cell containing a large excess
of SUVs. Thus, during the whole titration process the amount of available membrane can be
regarded as constant, and all injected peptides can be regarded as binding to the membranes. As a
result, the reaction heat in each injection is equal. The enthalpy of reaction can be calculated from
the average of heat in each injection31,32. We performed this experiment in the buffer with or

without 1 mM Ca2+. We then compared the difference in reaction enthalpy, which is caused by the
presence of Ca2+.
As shown in Table 3A, the binding enthalpy of the CoV-FPs is greater in the presence of Ca2+ than
in its absence. In both cases, the ΔH for SARS-2 and SARS-1 FP is greater than the MERS FP for
this exothermic reaction with that for SARS-2 being significantly greater than for SARS-1 only in
the presence of Ca2+. When the difference between the with/without Ca2+ cases was compared
(ΔΔH ≡ ΔH (in presence of Ca2+) – ΔH (in absence of Ca2+)), the ΔΔH of SARS-2 is greater than
that of SARS-1 FP, which is greater than that for MERS FP. The enthalpy of FP-membrane binding
mainly results from the folding of the FP33,34. Thus, the results suggest that: 1) SARS-2 FP folding
is stronger than that of the SARS-1 FP and even more so than that of the MERS FP; 2) While Ca2+
appears to promote the folding of the FP, it does it more effectively for the two SARS FPs than
the MERS FP. That Ca2+ promotes SARS-2 FP folding is consistent with the CD results (Fig 2C
and 2D) which show the alpha helical content increases as the [Ca2+ ] increases reaching a plateau
for [Ca2+]>2mM. This may be compared with the ESR observation that the Ca2+ promotes FPinduced membrane ordering in a similar [Ca2+] dependent manner (compare Fig 3A,B with Fig
2D).
Interactions of FPs with Calcium Ions Detected by ITC
We also used ITC to investigate whether Ca2+ ions directly interact with SARS-2 FPs. During this
titration, the Ca2+ was titrated into the reaction cell with FPs in solution. Substantial heat absorbed
during the titration was observed, with the heat absorbed saturating toward the end of the titration.
As shown in fig. 4 and Table 3B, when the ΔH vs. Ca2+:FP molar ratio plot was fitted using a onesite model, that makes the simple assumption that all binding sites have the same binding affinity,
the enthalpy change is ΔH=7.2 kCal/mol, with a binding constant Kb=2.7×104 M-1 and
stoichiometry n=1.86. From these parameters, we further calculated the free energy change
ΔG=−RTlnKb=6.3 kCal/mol and −TΔS= ΔG−ΔH = −0.9 kCal/mol. Thus, the calcium-SARS-2 FP
interaction is endothermic, and the binding ratio is two calcium ions per peptide. The reason why
the reaction is endothermic could be because the buffer solution (150 mM NaCl) contains large
amounts of Na+ ions that could also interact with FP and that a stronger binding of Ca2+ cations
displaces bound Na+ into the bulk solution. To test this hypothesis, we reduced the NaCl
concentration to 50 mM and performed an ITC titration. However, the baselines of the titration
curve we obtained were unstable, and we could not extract meaningful data. The reason for this
result is unclear, but it is likely that the peptide requires a certain level of salt concentration to
maintain its structure.
We performed the same experiment with SARS-1 FP and MERS FP (fig. 4C and 4D). As shown
in Table 3B, like SARS-2 FP, SARS-1 FP also exhibits an endothermic reaction with Ca2+, with a
stoichiometry of n=1.70, ΔH=6.8 kCal/mol, and Kb=2.5×104 M-1. For the MERS FP, the
stoichiometry is n=1.12, suggesting that it only binds one Ca2+, and the ΔH (3.1 kCal/mol) is
significantly lower than that of the SARS-1 FPs, also resulting from the less Ca2+ binding. We also

generated a triple mutation on the SARS-2 FP (E4A_D5A_D15A), which completely removed the
potential Ca2+ binding site on the FP1 section. As shown in fig. 4B and Table 4B, the n is reduced
to 1.03, which is coincident with our hypothesis that the triple mutant can only bind one Ca2+ ion
in its FP2 section. In conclusion, these ITC experiments demonstrate strong evidence for direct
calcium-FP interactions, and we associate it with one Ca2+ cation binding per FP1 or FP2.
The Ca2+ dependency is highly specific
We have already shown that the SARS-2 FP induces membrane ordering in a Ca2+ dependent
fashion. But how specific is it? In order to address this question, we have repeated the ESR
experiment in the presence of a number of different ions, including most of the biologically
relevant ions (Mg2+, Al3+, K+, Fe2+, Fe3+, Zn2+, Mn2+) as well as Tb3+ which is not biologically
relevant but is widely used as a Ca2+ substitute as the size is similar to the Ca2+ 35. We used the
1mM EGTA case as a control; as mentioned above even without any Ca2+, the FP has a “basal”
activity. We did not measure the effect of Na+ as there is 150 mM Na+ in the buffer, which provides
the necessary ionic strength for the folding of the FP. As shown in Fig 5A, the membrane ordering
activity of the FP in the presence of all other ions except Tb3+ is significantly lower than that in
the presence of Ca2+. The Tb3+ case is the closest to the Ca2+ case, but still substantially smaller.
The K+ has almost zero effect on the activity; it is almost the same as the EGTA case. When the
concentration of some ions increases to 2mM (fig 5B), the trends are the same. We then fixed the
P/L ratio to 1% and increased the concentration of ions (fig 5C), we again find that the Ca2+ and
Tb3+ will allow the FP to function more effectively (as measured by ΔS0) in higher concentrations,
while the Mg2+ and Mn2+ only boost the effect slightly. We repeated the ion-FP ITC experiments
for several ions, and one sees from fig 5D, that while the Tb3+ curve is comparable to that of the
Ca2+, the other ions have a significantly lower reaction heat than the Ca2+, which again shows the
specificity of Ca2+-FP binding.
DISCUSSION
The mechanism of membrane fusion is still only partially understood. Our past work has shown
that numerous viral FPs induce increased membrane ordering in a collective fashion, i.e. a
significant increase in S0 as a function of the P/L ratio14,15,17–20,22,36. We further suggested that FPinduced membrane ordering is accompanied with dehydration resulting from peptide insertion, and
this is a prerequisite step for removal of the repulsive forces between two opposing membranes,
thereby facilitating initialization of membrane fusion 14–17,20. We, in conjunction with our
collaborators, have also determined that the CoV (SARS-CoV and MERS CoV) and EBOV
requires Ca2+ for viral entry and that the Ca2+ binding site is on the FP18,19. Our current study
extends these observations to the SARS-2 FP revealing several new features.
We have established the hypothesis23 that the sequence immediately downstream from the S2’
cleavage site is the bona fide SARS-1 FP 18. Thus, we predicted that the homologous sequence on
the SARS-2 S protein to the SARS-1 FP is also the bona fide SARS-2 FP. We have now shown

that this SARS-2 FP does effectively induce membrane ordering, thereby confirming it must be
the FP for the SARS-2 S protein. We also showed that it perturbs the membrane structure in a Ca2+
dependent fashion as do the SARS-1 and MERS FPs.
Although this result was expected considering the similarity between SARS-2 and SARS-1 FPs,
we did find that SARS-2 FP leads to greater membrane ordering than SARS-1 FP, especially in
the head group and upper hydrophobic regions. It both induces a greater degree of membrane
ordering and has smaller X50 values. The SARS-2 FP also has a greater level of response to the
Ca2+ concentration (cf. fig 3F and Table 2) as it has a greater Max(ΔS0) and the Hill slope is greater.
This is supported by the fact that that the SARS-2 FP has a higher binding enthalpy than the SARS1 FP (cf. Table 3A). All the above suggest that the SARS-2 FP is more effective in membrane
binding and Ca2+ binding than SARS-1 FP.
Since there is only a three residue difference between the SARS-2 and SARS-1 FP, the most
reasonable cause for the difference between the activity of these two FPs must be in these three
residues. We suspect that the greater hydrophobicity of the three residues in SARS-2 FP is the
cause. The hydropathy index for Ile (4.5), Asp- (-3.5) and Ala (1.8) of the SARS-2 FP is greater
than or equal their counterparts (Met (1.9), Glu- (-3.5) and Gln (-3.5)) of the SARS-1 FP (greater
positive value means more hydrophobic) 37. Thus, the grand average of hydropathy value (GRAVY)
for SARS-2 FP is also greater than the SARS-1 FP (cf. Fig 1C). In the case of peptide-membrane
interaction, the interface scale of hydrophobicity is more useful as it measures the free energies of
transfer ΔG (kCal/mol) from water to POPC interface38. The interface scale of the Ile (-0.31), Asp(1.23) and Ala (0.17) of the SARS-2 FP is also greater than their counterparts (Met (-0.23), Glu(2.02), and Gln (0.58)) of the SARS-1 FP38 (here more negative value means more hydrophobic),
thus the overall interface scale value for the SARS-2 FP is also significantly more hydrophobic
than the SARS-1 FP.
In the process of the FP interacting with the membrane, most of the driving force comes from the
enthalpy gain by the folding of FP, whereas the opposing force comes from the entropy loss of
restricting the FP on the membrane surface.24,33,34 The latter can be partly compensated by
releasing water molecules during a hydrophobic interaction between the FP and the hydrophobic
region of the membrane. The more hydrophobic SARS-2 FP interacts with the hydrophobic core
more strongly, inserts more deeply into the membrane, and likely releases more water molecules
in the headgroup region and thus reduces the entropy loss more effectively than does the SARS-1
FP. SARS-2 FP also has a greater effect on the shallower hydrophobic region (5PC, fig 3B). The
folding of the FP is also modulated by how deep it inserts into the membrane. We observed that
the enthalpy release of the SARS-2 FP-membrane insertion is greater, indicating better folding
than the SARS-1 FP in the membrane, which also increases the driving force of the FP-membrane
interaction.
These mutations also account for the better Ca2+-FP binding and the better Ca2+ response of the
SARS-2 FP. Asp has been shown to have a greater Ca2+ binding affinity than Glu in aqueous

solution.39 Although Ala may not directly be involved in the interaction with Ca2+ in this case, it
has a greater Ca2+ affinity than Gln even at high pH.40
The greater ordering effect of the SARS-2 FP implies that the SARS-2 CoV enters the host cells
more effectively than SARS-1-CoV if other factors remain the same. This may be one of the
reasons why the SARS-2-CoV invades host cells more easily and cause more severe impact to
public health. The greater [Ca2+] response also implies that control of its access to Ca2+ could
reduce its infectivity.
We further investigated how specific is the role of Ca2+ in the activity of the SARS-2 FP. By
comparing a series of ions, we found that the FP-Ca2+ interaction is very specific. Although most
other ions can enhance the membrane ordering slightly above the “basal activity”, their effect is
much smaller than that of the Ca2+. The ion-FP interaction is also weaker, as revealed by ITC.
Although the FP has negatively charged residues and should attract cations, this selectivity is likely
to be governed by the many-body polarization effect41, which is an energetic cost arising from the
dense packing of multiple residues around the metal ion. The many-body effect depends on the
size of the ion, as well as the number and spatial arrangement of the residues around it. There are
three negatively charged residues in either the FP1 or FP2 region which satisfies the requirement
for the requirement of a multi-body interaction. We also showed that the only close alternative
candidate to Ca2+ is Tb3+, which has a size that is similar to that of Ca2+ (radius of Ca2+ and Tb3+
in solution is 103 and 101 picometer respectively). We found the ion-FP interaction is endothermal.
We suspect that the substantial amount of Na+ already in solution initially interacts with the
charged residues, and there is a more effective replacement by Ca2+ during the titration. That is,
ions with suitable size can efficiently replace the Na+, but this suggestion requires verification.
Calcium ions are important modulators of membrane fusion. Because of their positive charges,
they possess a generally enhancing but indirect effect on membrane fusion by electrostatic
interactions with negatively charged headgroups of lipid bilayers, and thus decrease the
electrostatic repulsion of the two opposing membranes that are in close proximity prior to
undergoing fusion. Calcium ions can also directly interact with fusion protein machineries, thereby
activating their fusogenicity, and in such cases membrane fusion is clearly calcium-dependent. For
example, in cellular SNARE-mediated synaptic vesicle fusion, calcium ions have been shown to
be required activators for such fusion machinery 42–44, i.e. without calcium ions present, membrane
fusion does not take place. Thus, SNARE-mediated synaptic membrane fusion is considered to be
calcium-dependent whereby calcium ions are fusion-activators. There are other situations in which
calcium ions have been shown to interact with protein fusogens and enhance their fusogenicity;
but without calcium, membrane fusion can still occur albeit at a reduced rate. In such cases
membrane fusion is only partly dependent on calcium ions.
There are relatively few cases for which calcium plays a direct role in viral membrane fusion,
especially for an N-terminal FP. In the case of influenza and HIV with an N-terminal FP, calcium
plays only an indirect enhancing effect on membrane fusion by affecting the membrane only45.

However, in cases such as CoV, calcium also plays a direct role by interacting with the FP directly.
The infection of Rubella virus has been shown to require Ca2+, but its E1 envelope glycoprotein is
a class II viral fusion protein that has an internal FP46. We have shown that the EBOV GP protein
is another case for Ca2+ dependence, but EBOV FP is an internal one19. In this study and our
previous study18,22, we showed that the viral entry of members of the CoV virus family (SARS-1,
SARS-2 and MERS), which all have an N-terminal FP, are also Ca2+ dependent, Ca2+ has a direct
activating role, and the FP is the Ca2+ target. Insights into the Ca2+ dependency of the FP would
help to better understand the mechanism of the SARS-2 infection, and should also help to
determine whether the membrane fusion of SARS-2 occurs on the cell surface or inside the
endosome by controlling the exocellular or intracellular [Ca2+]. This could lead to therapeutic
solutions to either targeting the FP-calcium interaction, or block the Ca2+ channel, and also
repurpose already approved drugs for the ongoing COVID19 pandemic.
MATERIALS AND METHODS
Lipids and Peptides
The lipids POPC, POPG, and the chain spin labels 5PC, 10PC and 14PC and the head group spin
label dipalmitoylphospatidyl-tempo-choline (DPPTC) were purchased from Avanti Polar Lipids
(Alabaster, AL) or synthesized in our laboratory according to previous protocols. Cholesterol was
purchased from Sigma (St. Louis, MO). The shuffled sequence of SARS-2 was generated using
Sequence Manipulation Suite (http://www.bioinformatics.org/sms2/shuffle_protein.html), and
this peptide was synthesized by Biomatik. The sequences of the peptides and the structure of the
spin labeled lipids are shown in fig. 1C.
We previously cloned the SARS-1 FP gene into a pET31 expression vector and the SARS-2 FP
gene is generated by the point-mutagenesis from the SARS-1 FP clone. The mutations were
generated using a USB Change-IT site directed mutagenesis kit (Affymetrix). The sequence has
been confirmed in the sequencing service provided by the Biotechnology Core Facility (BRC) at
Cornell University. The protocol of expression and purification also follows published
procedures19,47. Briefly, the relevant plasmids were transformed in BL21(DE3) Escherichia coli
competent cells and grown at 37 ˚C to an optical density ~0.8. Protein expression was induced for
3 hours at 30˚C by 0.5 mM IPTG. The harvested cells were lysed by sonication and clarified by
centrifugation at 40,000 rpm for 45 minutes. The supernatant containing the His-tagged fusion
protein was transferred to a pre-equilibrated Ni-NTA agarose resin column, and the supernatant
and resin were incubated for 2 hours at 4 ˚C on a rotator in wash buffer (containing 25 mM Tris,
500 mM NaCl, 20 mM Imidazole, 5% glycerol, 5 mM β-ME, and 10 mM CHAPS, pH 8). The
resin was then rinsed with digestion buffer (containing 25 mM Tris, 50 mM NaCl, 5 mM CaCl2,
and 5% glycerol, pH 7.5). 125 µL of Factor Xa (1 mg/mL) in 15 mL digestion buffer was added
to the resin and incubated overnight at room temperature. The proteins were eluted using 50 mL
wash buffer, dialyzed against dialysis buffer (25 mM Tris, 50 mM NaCl, 5% Glycerol, pH 8.5),
and purified using a Superdex Peptide 10/300 GL gel-filtration column (GE Healthcare).

Vesicle Preparation
The composition of membranes used in this study is consistent with our previous study 23. The
desired amount of POPC, POPG, cholesterol and 0.5% (mol:mol) spin-labeled lipids in chloroform
were mixed well and dried by N2 flow. The mixture was evacuated in a vacuum drier overnight to
remove any trace of chloroform. To prepare MLVs, the lipids were resuspended and fully hydrated
using 1 mL of pH 7 or pH 5 buffer (5 mM HEPES, 10 mM MES, 150 mM NaCl, and 0.1 mM
EDTA, pH 7 or pH 5) at room temperature (RT) for 2 hours. To prepare SUVs for CD and ITC
measurements and the PP-SUV system, the lipids were resuspended in pH 7 or pH 5 buffer and
sonicated in an ice bath for 20 minutes or when the suspension became clear. The SUVs solution
was then further clarified by ultracentrifugation at 13,000 rpm for 10 min.
Circular Dichroism (CD) Spectroscopy
The CD experiments were carried out on an AVIV CD spectrometer Aviv Model 215. The peptides
were mixed with SUVs in 1% P/L ratio with a final peptide concentration of 0.1 mg/mL at RT for
more than 10 min before the measurements. The measurements were performed at 25°C and two
repetitions were collected. Blanks were subtracted and the resulting spectra were analyzed. The
mean residue weight ellipticity was calculated using the formula: [Θ] = θ/(10×c×l×n), where θ is
the ellipticity observed (in degrees); c is the peptide concentration (in dmol); l is the path length
(0.1 cm); and n is the number of amino acids per peptide 32.
Isothermal Titration Calorimetry (ITC)
ITC experiments were performed in an N-ITC III calorimeter (TA Instrument, New Castle, DE).
To measure the enthalpy of FP membrane binding, FP at 20 µM was injected into 1 mL 5 mM
SUV solution at 37°C. Each addition was 10 µL, each injection time was 15 sec, and each interval
time was 5 min. Each experiment comprised about 25 to 30 injections. The data were analyzed
with Origin (OriginLab Corp., Northampton, MA).
To measure the peptide-Ca2+ interaction a total of 300 μL 2 mM CaCl2 in pH 5 buffer was injected
into 0.4 mM FP in pH 5 buffer at 37°C in a stepwise manner consisting of 10 µL per injection
except that the first injection was 2 μL. The injection time was 15 sec for each injection and the
interval time was 10 min. The background caused by the dilution of CaCl2 was subtracted by using
data from a control experiment that titrated CaCl2 in a pH 5 buffer. The data were analyzed with
Origin. The one-site model was used in the fitting to calculate the thermodynamic parameters. The
protein concentration is determined by dry weight and UV spectroscopy at wavelength = 280 nm
with extinction coefficient ε=1520 M-1 cm-1 for SARS-2 and SARS-1 FP, and 4080 M-1 cm-1 for
MERS FP in the oxidized condition.
ESR spectroscopy and nonlinear least-squares fit of ESR spectra

To prepare the samples for lipid ESR study, the desired amounts of FPs (1 mg/mL) were added
into the lipid MLVs dispersion. After 20 min of incubation, the dispersion was spun at 13,000 rpm
for 10 min. The concentrations of peptide were measured using UV to ensure complete binding of
peptide. The pellet was transferred to a quartz capillary tube for ESR measurement. ESR spectra
were collected on an ELEXSYS ESR spectrometer (Bruker Instruments, Billerica, MA) at X-band
(9.5 GHz) at 25°C using a N2 Temperature Controller (Bruker Instruments, Billerica, MA).
The ESR spectra from the labeled lipids were analyzed using the NLLS fitting program based on
the stochastic Liouville equation 28,48 using the MOMD or Microscopic Order Macroscopic
Disorder model as in previous studies 14–17,20. The fitting strategy is described below. We employed
the Budil et al. NLLS fitting program 28 to obtain convergence to optimum parameters. The gtensor and A-tensor parameters used in the simulations were determined from rigid limit spectra
14
. In the simulation, we required a good fit with a small value of χ2 and also good agreement
between the details of the final simulation and the experimental spectrum. Each experiment (and
subsequent fit) was repeated 2 or 3 times to check reproducibility and estimate experimental
uncertainty. Two sets of parameters that characterize the rotational diffusion of the nitroxide
radical moiety in spin labels were generated. The first set is the rotational diffusion constants. R⊥
and R|| are respectively the rates of rotation of the nitroxide moiety around a molecular axis
perpendicular and parallel to the preferential orienting axis of the acyl chain. The second set
consists of the ordering tensor parameters, S0 and S2, which are defined as follows:
S0=<D2,00>=<1/2(3cos2θ−1)>, and S2=<D2,02+D2,0-2> =<√(3/2)sin2θcos2φ>, where D2,00, D2,02,
and D2,0-2 are the Wigner rotation matrix elements and θ and φ are the polar and azimuthal angles
for the orientation of the rotating axes of the nitroxide bonded to the lipid relative to the director
of the bilayer , i.e. the preferential orientation of lipid molecules; the angular brackets imply
ensemble averaging. S0 and its uncertainty were then calculated in standard fashion from its
definition and the dimensionless ordering potentials C20 and C22 and their uncertainties found in
the fitting. The typical uncertainties we find for S0 range from 1-5 × 10-3, while the uncertainties
from repeated experiments are 5-8 × 10-3 or less than ±0.01. S0 indicates how strongly the chain
segment to which the nitroxide is attached is aligned along the normal to the lipid bilayer, which
is believed to be strongly correlated with hydration/dehydration of the lipid bilayers. As previously
described, S0 is the main parameter for such studies 17,49,50.

Fig. 1. (A). A model of the coronavirus FP or “platform” interacting with a lipid bilayer (adopted
from our previous model18 using the structural information from CD spectroscopy in this study,
and the molecular dynamics model26). (B) The structure of spin labeled lipids used: DPPTC, 5PC,
10PC and 14PC. (C) The sequence alignment of SARS-2, SARS, and MERS FPs, and their grand
average of hydropathy (GRAVY) values (calculated using GRAVY Calculator, http://www.gravycalculator.de/index.php). The residues in red highlight the difference between SARS-2 and SARS
FP. The residues in bold are the negatively charged residues which are potential Ca2+ binding sites.
Fig. 2. (A)The SDS-PAGE gel of the SARS-2 FP after purification using a His-tag affinity column;
the arrow shows the bands for the FP. The fractions were the combined and further purified using
size-exclusive chromatography. (B) CD Spectra of SARS-2 FP in solution (thin lines) and
POPC/POPG/Chol=3/1/1 SUVs (thick lines ) in pH 5 buffer (black) or pH 7 buffer (red) at 25°C,
and SARS-1 FP in SUVs at pH5 (blue). (C) CD spectra for SARS-2 FP in SUVs at pH5 show that
the alpha helix content increases with the increase of Ca2+ concentration. (D) The alpha helix
content of the FP in membranes at different Ca2+ concentrations, which was calculated from (C)
using K3D2 server51. The data were fit with the built-in logistic function of Origin, which shows
the X50= 0.83 mM. (E, F) The CD spectra of SARS-2 FP1 (E) and FP2 (F) in SUV in pH5 buffer
with 0mM (black) and 2 mM (red) CaCl2. The percentage of alpha helix and beta strand was
calculated using K3D2.
Fig. 3. Plots of order parameters of DPPTC (A), 5PC (B), 10PC (C) and 14PC(D) versus
peptide:lipid ratio (P/L ratio) of SARS-2 FP, SARS FP and MERS FP in POPC/POPG/Chol=3/1/1
MLVs in buffer at pH5 with 150 mM NaCl at 25°C. Black, SARS-2 FP with 1 mM Ca2+ and at
pH 5; red, SARS-2 FP with 1 mM EGTA; blue, SARS FP with 1 mM Ca2+; green, MERS FP with
1 mM Ca2+. The curves were fitted with the logistic function (Table 1A and 1B) (E). Plots of local
order parameters of DPPTC versus P/L ratio as in A-D with pH indicated. Black, SARS-2 FP at
pH 5; red, SARS-2 FP triple mutant (E4A_D5A_D15A) at pH 5; blue, SARS-2 FP at pH 7; and
green, a peptide with shuffled sequence of SARS-2 FP at pH 5. (F) Plot of local order parameters
of DPPTC with and without 1% peptide binding (ΔS0) versus Ca2+ as in A-D. Black, SARS-2 FP;
blue, SARS FP and green, MERS FP. The experiments were typically repeated three times. The
typical uncertainties from simulation found for S0 range from 1-5 × 10-3, while the uncertainties
from repeated experiments were 5-8 × 10-3 or less than ±0.01. We show in Panels A and B the bars
for the standard deviation. Statistical significance analyses were performed using two-tailed
Student’s t-test on the S0’s of 0% SARS-2 FP and 5% SARS-2 FP at the “1mM Ca2+” condition,
*** ≤ 0.001, highly significant.
