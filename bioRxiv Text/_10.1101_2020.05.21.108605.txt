ABSTRACT
Aims:
We investigate mechanisms for potential pro-arrhythmic effects of hydroxychloroquine (HCQ)
alone, or combined with azithromycin (AZM), in Covid-19 management supplementing the
limited available experimental cardiac safety data.

Methods:
We integrated patch-clamp studies utilizing In Vitro ProArrhythmia Assay (CiPA) Schema
IC50 paradigms, molecular modelling, cardiac multi-electrode array and voltage (RH237)
mapping, ECG studies, and Ca2+ (Rhod-2 AM) mapping in isolated Langendorff-perfused
guinea-pig hearts with human in-silico ion current modelling.

Results:
HCQ blocked IKr and IK1 with IC50s (10±0.6 and 34±5.0 µM) within clinical therapeutic ranges,
INa and ICaL at higher IC50s, leaving Ito and IKs unaffected. AZM produced minor inhibition of
INa, ICaL, IKs, and IKr,, sparing IK1 and Ito. HCQ+AZM combined inhibited IKr and IK1 with IC50s
of 7.7±0.8 µM and 30.4±3.0 µM, sparing INa, ICaL and Ito. Molecular modelling confirmed
potential HCQ binding to hERG. HCQ slowed heart rate and ventricular conduction. It
prolonged PR, QRS and QT intervals, and caused prolonged, more heterogeneous, action
potential durations and intracellular Ca2+ transients. These effects were accentuated with
combined HCQ+AZM treatment, which then elicited electrical alternans, re-entrant circuits
and wave break. Modelling studies attributed these to integrated HCQ and AZM actions
reducing IKr and IK1, thence altering cell Ca2+ homeostasis.

Conclusions:
Combined HCQ+AZM treatment exerts pro-arrhythmic ventricular events by synergetically
inhibiting IKr, IKs with resulting effects on cellular Ca2+ signalling, and action potential
propagation and duration. These findings provide an electrophysiological basis for recent FDA
cardiac safety guidelines cautioning against combining HCQ/AZM when treating Covid-19.

INTRODUCTION
The severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) pandemic has now
infected >5.18 million individuals causing 338039 deaths as of 23-May-2020
(www.ecdc.eurpoe.eu). Although there are no approved drugs to prevent or treat SARS-CoV2 infection, recent use of the anti-malarial 4-aminoquinolines chloroquine (CQ) or
hydroxychloroquine (HCQ) alone, or combined with the antibiotic azithromycin (AZM) in
Covid-19 therapy has attracted global attention and extensive early clinical use and trials(1, 2).
An initial nonrandomized open label clinical trial of 20 cases, had associated HCQ treatment
with viral load reduction or disappearance in COVID-19 patients, effects reinforced by
AZM(3). This subsequently prompted the US Food and Drugs Administration (FDA)
authorization of emergency use of CQ or HCQ, alone or in combination with AZM in Covid19 therapy(4, 5). Currently, large number of trials of these combinations, with or without the
addition of further drugs, are registered worldwide (1, 2).
However, several recent studies have flagged cardiac safety concerns for the CQ/HCQ and
AZM regime in Covid-19 therapy. Particular concern has arisen regarding potential synergistic
effects of HCQ and AZM on QT duration and cardiovascular mortality (6-10). Higher
mortalities and incidences of prolonged corrected QT (QTc) intervals were reported in patients
at a Brazilian hospital receiving the high dose (12 g total dose over 10 days, ~1.2 g/day, giving
plasma levels of ~10 µM) than the lower dose of CQ, typified by its use in other conditions
such as rheumatoid arthritis and systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE). This phase 2b
randomized Covid-19 trial was terminated after enrolment of only 81 out of the target of 440
patients owing to occurrences of adverse events (6). A retrospective data analysis from United
States Veterans Health Administration medical centers suggested increased overall mortality
even in patients treated with HCQ alone (7). The largest available analysis from an international
consortium on HCQ safety covering over 950,000 patients from six countries declared HCQ
safe for short-term use at doses currently used for conditions such as rheumatoid arthritis.
However, it urged caution in its use when combined with AZM in view of potential risks of
cardiovascular mortality related to QTc prolongation(8). Two recent reports of 90 and 201
patients hospitalized with COVID-19 treated with HCQ, with or without AZM, associated
these drugs with QTc prolongation, especially when used in combination(9, 11). Although
these studies are small, only one case of torsades de pointes was documented and the therapy
was seldom discontinued. They suggested that more QT interval monitoring studies should be
undertaken before final recommendations can be made(11). Based on these findings, the FDA

issued a cautions warning against use of HCQ or CQ for COVID-19 outside of the hospital
setting or a clinical trial, due to risks of heart rhythm problems(4). This does not affect FDAapproved uses in malaria, systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), and rheumatoid arthritis where
they have been used many years. Both HCQ and AZM have been in clinical use alone or in
combination in other disease conditions for many years with cardiac safety then not considered
a major concern.
Currently, there is very limited data evaluating cardiac safety particularly concerning use of
HCQ in combination with AZM, although multiple randomized trials are currently in progress
evaluating the efficacy of this combination for Covid-19. We therefore explored the cardiac
safety of HCQ alone or in combination with AZM using the FDA recommended
Comprehensive in Vitro Proarrhythmia Assay (CiPA) protocols to understand arrhythmic
mechanisms (12). Furthermore, we expanded the CiPA protocol by introducing assessments of
effects on membrane and Ca2+ clocks, their interaction and cardiac conduction recently
suggested as crucial indicators for ventricular arrhythmogenesis (13, 14).

RESULTS
The four groups of experiments conducted assessed the mechanistic basis for the clinical
reports bearing upon cardiac safety of HCQ, whether applied alone or in combination with
AZM.
Patch-clamp studies of single channel characteristics
The first series of experiments assessed the effects of HCQ (Fig. 1) and AZM alone (Fig. 2)
and in combination (Fig. 3) on a range of human cardiac ion channels. The experiments on
HCQ and AZM themselves adopted concentrations fully encompassing plasma levels
associated with their clinical use. The same HCQ concentration range was then combined with
10 µM AZM. These examined inward, cardiac channel currents from hNav1.5 (INa, A), Cav1.2
(ICa,L, B), mediating or maintaining membrane action potential depolarization. They also
studied outward Kv4.3 (Ito, C), hERG (IKr, C), KCNQ1/E1 (IKs, E) and Kir2.1 (IK1, F) normally
mediating action potential recovery. This encompassed the range of ion channels recommended
by the CiPA protocol.
Figure1 (left panels, i) exemplifies observed ionic currents in the presence of 0, 1, 10 and 100
µM HCQ. The insets summarize the related voltage clamping protocols, fully described in
extended Methods in Supplementary data. Five concentrations ranging from 10-8 to 10-4 M
were tested for each current examined in 3 to 6 cells at each concentration. Mean concentrationresponse plots (right panels, ii) used the maximum magnitudes of each current. Where
applicable, the consequent alterations in such current magnitudes following pharmacological
challenge were used to derive IC50 values.
Figure1 (right panels, ii) plots mean (±SEM) fractional reductions in current magnitude against
HCQ concentration for INa (A), ICaL (B), Ito (C), IKs (D), IKr (E) and IK1 (F) . µM-HCQ inhibited
both IKr tail and IK1 pulse currents with IC50s of 10±0.6 µM (D) and 34±5 µM (F), respectively,
with more marked effects on IKr, where the IC50 fell close to expected therapeutic levels in
current Covid-19 treatment regimes (6), than IK1. In contrast, µM-HCQ has less effect on INa
and ICaL with IC50s of 113 ± 78 µM and 209 ± 94 µM respectively, Nevertheless, HCQ caused
graded INa reductions through the entire HCQ concentration range typified in a 22±1.8%
reduction at 1 µM. No significant inhibition of Ito and IKs by µM-HCQ was observed .

Figure 2 presents corresponding results obtained with AZM applied by itself similarly
encompassing clinical therapeutic levels. A previously reported dose regime administering
500, 250 and 250 mg/day on each of three successive days gave a day 2 serum concentration
of 0.22 μM(15)). However, the entire, 0-100 μM explored AZM concentration range yielded
only minimal inhibitory effects. Even 10 µM and 100 µM AZM reduced INa (A), ICaL, (B) IKs
(E) and IKr (D) by <17% and <35% respectively and produced negligible effects on IK1 (F) and
no effect on Ito (C).
Finally, Figure 3 summarizes results of applying the same range of five HCQ concentrations
displayed in Fig. 1 now combined with 10 µM AZM. Adding AZM did not significantly alter
the effects of HCQ on INa (A), ICaL (B), Ito (C), and IKs (E), but reduced the IC50 for IKr (IC50 =
7.7 ± 0.8 µM) and IK1 (30.4 ± 3.0 µM).
Computational molecular docking determining the interaction between HCQ, AZM and
hERG
The above findings particularly concerning pharmacological effects on hERG prompted
computational molecular docking explorations for possible interactions between HCQ and
AZM and a recent hERG homotetramer structure (PDB ID: 5va1; 1) (Fig.4). We used scoring
docking visual inspection irrespective of the docking protocol. Figure 4 illustrates the HCQhERG interaction, derived using three separate rigid-receptor docking methods. HCQ interacts
predominantly with Y652 from one or more subunits. Interactions with other residues including
F656 but also S624, A653, and S660 occurred less frequently. Variability in observed docking
positions could be attributed to the highly symmetric structure of the hERG channel pore
constituting the binding site enabling many equivalent positions. In contrast, no interactions
were demonstrated between AZM and hERG (data not shown).
Electrical mapping and electrocardiographic studies in ex vivo heart preparations
We then explored the effects of HCQ alone and combined with AZM in the whole heart on
electrophysiological activation and recovery, their electrocardiographic correlates and the
consequent Ca2+ signalling processes reflecting excitation-contraction coupling.
Figure 5A summarises sites of apical stimulation, and multi-electrode array (MEA) and ECG
recording in the electrical mapping experiments. Representative left atrial (LA) and left

ventricular (LV) isochronal conduction maps (B) obtained in the presence of 0 - 10 µM HCQ
revealed a clear reduction of conduction velocity and increased conduction heterogeneities at
10 µM HCQ. Synergistic inhibitory effects on conduction velocity were observed when hearts
were treated with the 10 µM HCQ in combination with 10 µM AZM. All these effects were
reversed on drug washout (C(i)). 10 µM HCQ significantly decreased conduction velocities of
excitation with further decreases in velocity with the 10 µM HCQ and 10 µM AZM
combination (C(ii)).
Quantification of the corresponding electrocardiogram (ECG) traces (D(i)) demonstrated that
both 10 µM HCQ, and 10 µM HCQ in combination with 10 µM AZM, decreased heart rate
(HR)(D(i)), and increased QT interval (D(iii)), PR interval (D(iv)) and QRS duration (D(v)).
In particular, AZM when combined with HCQ augmented its effects on HR, and QT and PR
interval. Together these results suggested that 10 µM HCQ, and 10 µM HCQ and 10 µM AZM
combined, exerted synergistic inhibitory effects on heart rate and conduction, and prolonged
cardiac repolarisation.
Optical mapping studies in ex vivo heart preparations
We next investigated the effects of HCQ alone and in combination with AZM using optical
fluorescence mapping in sinus-paced Langendorff-perfused hearts using the recording and
ECG monitoring configurations illustrated in Figure 6A(i). Voltage mapping measurements of
action potential initiation and conduction (Fig. 6A(ii)) demonstrated bradycardic effects
(A(iii)), visible conduction heterogeneities and slowed conduction (A(ii)) at 10 µM HCQ,
effects were augmented by combination with 10 µM AZM (Fig. 6A (iv)). Similarly, optical
potentiometric mapping revealed that 10 µM HCQ prolonged action potential duration at 90%
repolarisation (APD90) (B(i and ii)) with 10 µM HCQ, effects further prolonged by its
combination with AZM (Fig.5B(iii)).
Ca2+ dye, Rhod-2 AM (CaD), mapping of ventricular calcium transient (CaT) characteristics
demonstrated increased magnitudes of and dispersions in CaD durations at 90% recovery
(CaD90) (Figure 6C(i)). The latter were attributed to changes late in the CaT records (C(ii)).
The quantified CaD90 magnitudes (B(iii)) and dispersions (B(iv)) both increased with 10 but
not 1.0 µM HCQ. The combination of 10 µM HCQ with either 1 or 10 µM AZM exerted
significantly greater effects than 10 µM HCQ alone.

Optical mapping assessments of arrhythmic tendency in ex vivo heart preparations
Finally, voltage dye optical mapping studies during ventricular pacing were used to assess
susceptibility to arrhythmia induction before and after drug challenge in isolated perfused
hearts (Fig.7A.B). Whilst 10 µM HCQ did not exert detectable arrhythmic effects at the cycle
lengths (CL) used, a combination of HCQ and AZM produced AP alternans at 180 ms CL and
episodes of non-sustained torsadogenic-like VT at 170 ms CL in 5 out of 5 hearts. The
corresponding potentiometric maps obtained during the colour coded timepoints 1-6 are
represented in C. At a CL of 170 ms, the conduction maps with HCQ+AZM demonstrated
significant disruptions of the normally coherent propagation of excitation waves with evidence
of excitation re-entry and wave break. Thus, the electrophysiological changes outlined above
associated particularly with HCQ and AZM in combination were associated with a ventricular
arrhythmic tendency.
Computational simulations of HCQ and AZM on human ventricular action potentials
To translate the experimental data describing the multi-ion channel blocking effects of HCQ
and/or AZM to human ventricular excitation, the ORd model was implemented to reconstruct
the impacts of HCQ alone and combined with AZM, on human ventricular action potentials
including APD90 and maximal upstroke velocities.

Figure 8A displays predicted action potentials under control conditions and in the presence of
HCQ, and HCQ and AZM combined. It was shown that with the 10 µM HCQ alone, the APD
was prolonged by 100 ms as compared to the control condition. With the combined action of
HCQ and AZM, a synergistic action of the two drugs on APD prolongation was seen, which
was manifested in a greater increase of APD90 of ~300 ms (Figure 8B). Such an APD
prolongation can be attributable to the integrated action of reduced repolarisation potassium
channel currents of IKr and IK1, and reduced depolarising currents of INa, ICaL and INaCa. A small
reduction in action potential maximum upstroke velocities was also observed by both HCQ and
HCQ+AZM due to the effects on INa.

DISCUSSION
The main findings of this study are: (1) Reported therapeutic levels of HCQ blocked multiple
human cardiac ion channels, particular hERG (mediating IKr) and Kir2.1 (IK1,) and, to a lesser
degree, hNav1.5 (INa). AZM potentiated the effects of HCQ on hERG and Kir2.1. (2)
Computational molecular docking studies correspondingly predicted HCQ binding to hERG.
Accordingly, (3) at the level of intact hearts, HCQ increased QT intervals as well as ventricular
AP and Ca2+ transient durations and their heterogeneities. However, (4) HCQ further reduced
heart rates, A-V and ventricular conduction as well as increasing conduction heterogeneities.
All these effects were accentuated by combining HCQ challenge with AZM. Furthermore, (5)
The HCQ+AZM combination, but not HCQ alone, then went on to increase susceptibilities to
ventricular arrhythmic events consistent with significant clinical cardiac safety risks. (6)
Human in-silico modelling of ion channel effects of HCQ and AZM recapitulated the altered
APDs but not the reduced conduction. This mechanistic electrophysiological data complements
ongoing multiple randomized trials evaluating clinical efficacy and cardiac safety profiles of
these drugs as a treatment for Covid-19. The findings directly align with recent FDA guidelines
concerning their use.
These successive lines of investigation were combined to reach an integrated view of HCQ and
AZM action. This began with the approach recommended by the CiPA guidelines (12) in which
we examined effects of HCQ and AZM on human cardiac ion channels responsible for the
main inward (hNav1.5 (INa) Cav1.2 (ICa,L)) and outward (Kv4.3 (Ito), hERG (IKr), KCNQ1/E1
(IKs) and Kir2.1 (IK1)) currents in the human ventricular myocardium. HCQ and AZM were
studied both alone and in combination through a wide concentration range encompassing and
extending beyond reported therapeutic levels. The latter typically fell around 1.15-4.5 µM(16)
and 0.5-0.7 µM(17) for HCQ in SLE and rheumatoid arthritis patients on a daily 400 mg dose.
In contrast, its dose used in Covid-19, 1.2 g/day, would give substantially higher therapeutic
concentrations of ~10 µM(6). Blood AZM levels following successive daily 500 mg and two
250 mg doses were reported at 0.22 μM(15). HCQ both alone and combined with AZM
synergistically inhibited IKr and IK1 with IC50s at the high end of reported therapeutic levels,
with some minor inhibition of INa in this range.
Consistent with these experimental findings, computational molecular docking simulations
utilizing a recent hERG homotetramer structure (PDB ID: 5va1; 1) demonstrate potential HCQ
binding. This is predominantly with Y652 from one or more hERG subunits. Interactions with
10

other residues including F656 but also S624, A653, and S660 occurred less frequently. There
was no predicted AZM-hERG binding in the model although this does not discount it occurring
in-vivo.
Others have also explored the electrophysiological effects of HCQ or AZM on some cardiac
ion channels but did so at three times the clinically relevant concentration and above (15, 18).
Furthermore, the present study systematically evaluates HCQ and AZM in combination for the
first time. Furthermore, the only report on electrophysiological effects of HCQ specifically
studied sinoatrial cells, demonstrating significant reductions in hyperpolarization-activated
currents (If), with reduced ICaL and IKr observed at 3 µM (18). Nevertheless, this HCQ action
on If explains its bradycardic effects observed here, further illustrating its broad cardiac
electrophysiological actions. Such a bradycardic medication in the presence of a hypotension
accompanying sepsis or SARS could potentially exacerbate a septic shock.
At the whole heart level, our optical mapping studies demonstrate that HCQ correspondingly
prolongs ventricular APD as well as CaD, to extents further exacerbated by combination with
AZM. This fulfils expectations from its inhibition of IKr and IK1 and translates to the observed
electrocardiographic QT prolongations. It is interesting to note that even prior to the Covid-19
pandemic, series of case reports have led to both HCQ and AZM being listed as definite causes
of prolonged QT interval and risk of torsade de pointes for patients with long QT syndrome on
crediblemeds.org (19).
Prolonged APD predisposes to early afterdepolarisations (EADs) during the plateau phase of
the ventricular action potential, classically attributed to ICaL reactivation (20). EADs are also
more common under conditions of intracellular Ca2+ overload, including increased sympathetic
drive: ICaL can be enhanced by high intracellular Ca2+ levels and by L-type Ca2+ channel
phosphorylation by CaMKII(21). EADs may potentially trigger ectopic beats and initiate
arrhythmic events given suitable substrate.
In addition to these recovery phenomena, we also demonstrate for the first time that HCQ
reduces ventricular conduction on multi-electrode arrays and optical mapping recording, and
compromise atrioventricular and intraventricular conduction, reflected in prolonged PR
intervals and QRS durations, to extents accentuated by further addition of AZM. Such findings
11

are consistent with Na channel block (22) of the kind exemplified clinically by the CAST trials
(23) and/or compromised gap junction function(24). Together, the combination demonstrated
here of prolonged and increased dispersions of repolarisation and calcium handling combined
with slowed conduction would offer a suitable substrate for sustained re-entrant arrhythmia.
Thus, the combined exposure to HCQ and AZM, but not HCQ alone provoked alternans,
ventricular tachycardic episodes, and re-entrant excitation following progressively accelerated
cardiac pacing.
Finally, a validated human ventricular myocyte mathematical model integrated the observed
ion channel properties with the effects on action potential and intracellular calcium handling
characteristics in intact hearts. It separated whole heart electrophysiological features that were
explicable in terms of the single channel properties and those attributable to altered calcium
homeostasis. The modelling reproduced effects of surface ion channel function and their
interactions forming a ‘membrane clock’ underlying the measurable electrical activity (Fig.
8C)(14). It reproduced the action potential prolongation and consequent prolonged QT
intervals with HCQ and the synergistic effects of combining HCQ with AZM, attributing these
to their combined effects on IKr and IK1. These latter events have been described as feeding
forward into a ‘Ca2+ clock’ driving excitation-contraction coupling but whose events exert
feedback effects modifying action potential conduction, recovery, and post-recovery stability,
exemplified by Ca2+ feedback effects on Na+ channel and gap junction function (Fig. 8C), as
well as longer-term effects on channel expression(13, 25). The modelling predicted the
increased calcium transient magnitudes and durations particularly with HCQ+AZM (Fig 8C),
but only small changes in maximum upstroke velocity attributable to Na channel blockade. The
observed conduction slowing nevertheless could arise from a Ca2+-dependent gap junction
uncoupling.
These results together provide an integrated basis for the electrophysiological and
pharmacological effects of HCQ, AZM and their combination. They thereby underpin recent
FDA guidelines cautioning against combined HCQ/AZM administration for treatment of
Covid-19 on grounds of cardiac safety. Admittedly, physiological though not pro-arrhythmic
effects occurred with HCQ administered alone at the ~10 µM concentrations associated with
Covid-19 therapy and not at the lower ~1.0 µM HCQ levels associated with therapy for
rheumatoid arthritis and SLE. HCQ alone at therapeutic doses thus did not increase incidences
of experimental ventricular arrhythmias in healthy hearts. Nevertheless, safety threshold doses

could be reduced by accompanying cardiac injury arising from viral toxicity, sepsis, hypoxiarelated myocyte injury, and immune-mediated cytokine storm in Covid-19. Furthermore, AZM
potentiated the HCQ toxicity, now producing arrhythmic outcomes. The present findings thus
strongly indicate a desirability for monitoring electrocardiographic, including QT, changes and
cardiac injury during 4-aminoquinoline-macrolide therapy for Covid-19 patients.

METHODS
Study Approval
All procedures were approved by The Institutional Animals Ethics Committees at Henan
University, Kaifeng, China under and the national guidelines under which the institution
operates, and also conform with the NIH Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals.
Guinea pigs (male; 300-350 g) were provided by The Experimental Animal Center of the
Medical College of Xi'an Jiaotong University and maintained in a pathogen−free facility at
Henan University with ad libitum access to food and water. Animals were humanely sacrificed
by intraperitoneal injection with 3% pentobarbital sodium (50 mg/kg).

Single-cell electrophysiological recordings
Core human cardiac channels were heterologously expressed in recombinant HEK293 or CHO
cell lines and studied using conventional patch clamp methods. Stable cell lines expressing
Nav1.5 and Cav1.2/β2/α2/δ1, hERG, Kir2.1, Kv4.3, KCNQ1/E1 were used. All currents were
recorded using a MultiClamp 700A amplifier, 1550A digitizer and pCLAMP 10.6 software
(Molecular devices, USA). Patch electrodes with resistances of 2-5 MΩ were pulled with a P97 micropipette puller (Sutter Instruments, USA). The conventional whole-cell recordings
were obtained by manual suction for hERG, Kir2.1, Kv4.3 and Nav1.5 studies. Perforated
whole-cell recordings of KCNQ1/E1 and Cav1.2 were obtained following perforation with 200
µg/ml Amphotericin included in the pipette solution. After whole-cell mode were obtained,
cells were used in voltage clamp mode for the current recordings. The external solution
contained (mM)：NaCl 137；MgCl2 1；KCl 4；glucose 10; HEPES 10；CaCl2 1.8, pH
adjusted to 7.4 with NaOH. The K+-containing pipette solution contained (mM)：KCl 40；
KF 100；MgCl2 2； EGTA 5；HEPES 10，pH adjusted to 7.2 with KOH. The sodium and
calcium current pipette solution contained (mM): CsCl 65；CsF 75；MgCl2 2.5；EGTA 5；
HEPES 10, pH adjusted to 7.3 with CsOH.

Molecular modelling and docking studies
The experimental structure of the open hERG channel (PDB ID: 5va1; 1) was selected as a
receptor for molecular docking studies. The structure was prepared for docking using Protein
Preparation Wizard using default settings including modelling of missing loops using Prime.

The loops spanning residues 433-448, 578-582, and 588-602 in each subunit were successfully
rebuilt. The centroid of residues Y652 and F656 from every subunit was defined as the centre
of the docking binding site. The HCQ structure was obtained from PubChem and prepared for
docking using LigPrep. Three separate rigid-receptor docking methods were used including:
(i) Glide SP docking, (ii) FlexX docking followed by HYDE re-scoring, and (iii) AutoDock
Vina docking with each set to output 20 poses per LigPrep HCQ state. Poses from Glide, FlexX,
and AutoDock Vina were also re-scored using RF-Score-VS.

Langendorff- perfused isolated hearts
Guinea pigs (male; 300-350 g) were humanely killed by intraperitoneal injection with
pentobarbital sodium (50 mg/kg). Hearts rapidly excised after thoracotomy were mounted onto
a Langendorff perfusion system and perfused with a modified Tyrode’s solution (119 NaCl,
25 NaHCO3, 4 KCl, 1.2 KH2PO4, 1 MgCl2, 1.8 CaCl2.2H2O, and 10 D-glucose (mM)
equilibrated with 5% CO2 and 95% O2) with the flow rate of 8 ml/min at 37°C. Hearts were
perfused and monitored for stability for 20 mins before experimental procedures commenced.

Electrical mapping of ex vivo heart preparations
A multi-electrical array (MEA) mapping system (EMS64-USB-1003, MappingLab Ltd., UK)
was employed to record extracellular potentials (ECP) from the epicardium. Two 64 channel
MEAs (MappingLab Ltd., UK) were employed for left atrial and left ventricular simultaneous
recordings. ECP signals were recorded at a 10 kHz sampling using synchronized 64 channel
EMS64-USB-1003 recording systems and recorded using EMapRecord 5.0 software
(MapingLab Ltd., UK) and stored in a computer for subsequent off-line analysis.
Electrocardiograms (ECG) were continuously recorded by two ECG electrodes (MappingLab
Ltd., UK) positioned on the right atrium and left ventricle respectively.
The epicardial isochronal activation map during sinus rhythm or imposed pacing was plotted
as time differences between the earliest activation site and the individual activation site on each
channel. Activation times were calculated as the point of maximal negative slope of activation
waveforms. The conduction velocity (CV) was calculated from the difference in timing and the
known distance between the recording points using EMapScope 5.0 software (MappingLab
Ltd.).

Optical mapping of ex vivo heart preparations
After the Langendorff-perfused hearts reached steady state, contraction artefacts were
mimimised using blebbistatin (10 µM). Dye loading was aided by pre-perfusion with pluronic
F127 (20 % w/v in DMSO). Rh237 (1µg/ml) and Rhod2-AM (1µg/ml) were perfused to enable
simultaneous membrane potential and Ca2+ measurements at 37 ℃ .
Two 530 nm LEDs (LEDC-2001, MappingLab Ltd) were used to illuminate the heart after
their emissions were bandpass ﬁltered (wavelengths 530±20 nm) to minimize stray excitation
light reaching the dyes. The fluorescence light was passed through a 550 nm long-pass filter
and then a dichroic mirror with a cut off of 638 nm. Fluorescence light with wavelengths above
638 nm was passed through a 700 nm long-pass ﬁlter and then imaged by the camera for
recording voltage signals. Fluorescence light below 638 nm was passed through a bandpass
filter (585±40 nm) then imaged by the camera for recording calcium signals (OMS-PCIE-2002,
MappingLab Ltd). The raw spatial resolution was 128-by-128 pixels, the total mapping area
was 16×16 mm and the temporal resolution was 900 frames/second.
The cameras of the optical mapping system, LED lights and stimulator and ECG recording
were simultaneously driven by an 8 channel TTL analog-digital converter and OMapRecord
4.0 software (MappingLab Ltd.). For the analysis of optical mapping signals and generation of
isochronal maps, data were semi-automatically processed using OMapScope 5.0 software
(MappingLab Ltd). In this experimental configuration, stable recordings for voltage (Vm) and
intracellular Ca2+ (CaT) signals could be obtained for >2 hours in preliminary experiments
assessing system stability.

Arrhythmia induction protocol
Stimuli were generated by an isolated constant voltage/current stimulator (VCS3001,
MappingLab Ltd., UK). They were delivered with a platinum electrode onto the epicardial apex
at an amplitude 1.5 × the diastolic voltage threshold and a 2 ms pulse width. The optical
mapping was performed in conjunction with an “alternans mapping” protocol. The heart was
consecutively paced at basic cycle lengths (BCL) from 210 with 10 ms decrement until 170
ms. The heart was paced 50 times with 2 ms duration pulses and the optical mapping recording
was performed at the last 2 second in each episode. This protocol was performed both before
and after drugs were delivered.

In silico model reconstruction
The O'Hara-Rudy (ORd) human ventricular model(26) was modified to incorporate the actions
on multi-channel block of HCQ, including the dose-dependent block of INa,, ICaL,, Ito, IKr, IKs
IK1 and the Na+-Ca2+ exchange current, INCX. This model was selected as it was developed from
and validated against experimental data from human ventricular cells and found suitable for
studying actions of drugs. The simulations evoked action potentials by a supra-threshold
stimulus in control runs and following application of HCQ, and combined application of HCQ
and AZM. Action potential time courses characterized by AP durations at 90% repolarisation
(APD90) and maximal upstroke velocity (MUP) and the underlying ion channel currents
targeted by the drugs were recorded for analysis.

Statistical analysis
All patch clamp recorded data were analyzed using Clampfit 10.6 (Molecular Devices, USA),
OriginPro 8.0 (Origin Lab, USA) and Adobe Illustrator 10 (Adobe, USA). The concentrationresponse curve was fitted by the logistic equation y= A2+(A1-A2)/[1+(x/x0)p], where x is the drug
concentration, and p is the Hill coefficient. All data are expressed as the means ± SEM. Oneway ANOVA followed by multiple-comparison test was used to evaluate multiple test
treatments. A value of p<0.05 was considered to be statistically significant. IC50 denotes the
concentration determined for half-maximal inhibitory effects. In the figures, the designations
for p values are: *p<0.05, **P<0.01 and ***P<0.001 respectively.
