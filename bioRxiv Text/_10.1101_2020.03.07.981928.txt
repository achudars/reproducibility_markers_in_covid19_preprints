Abstract
In December 2019, the first cases of infection with a novel coronavirus, SARS-CoV-2,
were diagnosed in Wuhan, China. Due to international travel and human-to-human
transmission, the virus spread rapidly inside and outside of China. Currently, there is
no effective antiviral treatment for coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19); therefore,
research efforts are focused on the rapid development of vaccines and antiviral drugs.
The SARS-CoV-2 main protease constitutes one of the most attractive antiviral drug
targets. To address this emerging problem, we have synthesized a combinatorial
library of fluorogenic substrates with glutamine in the P1 position. We used it to
determine the substrate preferences of the SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 main
proteases, using natural and a large panel of unnatural amino acids. On the basis of
these findings, we designed and synthesized an inhibitor and two activity-based
probes, for one of which we determined the crystal structure of its complex with the
SARS-CoV-2 Mpro. Using this approach we visualized SARS-CoV-2 active Mpro within
nasopharyngeal epithelial cells of a patient with active COVID-19 infection. The results
of our work provide a structural framework for the design of inhibitors as antiviral agents
or diagnostic tests.

Introduction
In December 2019, a severe respiratory disease of unknown origin emerged in
Wuhan, Hubei province, China.1,2 Symptoms of the first patients were flu-like and
included fever, cough and myalgia, but with a tendency to develop a potentially fatal
dyspnea and acute respiratory distress syndrome.2 Genetic analysis confirmed a
betacoronavirus as the causing agent. The virus was initially named 2019 novel
coronavirus (2019-nCoV),1-3 but shortly thereafter, it was renamed to SARS-CoV-2.4
By May 13, 2020, the WHO had registered >4.4 million cumulative cases of
coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), with >296.000 deaths.5
Currently, there is no approved vaccine or treatment for COVID-19. Efforts are
being made to characterize molecular targets, pivotal for the development of anticoronaviral therapies.6 The main protease (Mpro, also known as 3CLpro), is one of the
coronavirus non-structural proteins (Nsp5) designated as a potential target for drug
development.7,8 Mpro cleaves the viral polyproteins, generating twelve non-structural
proteins (Nsp4-Nsp16), including the RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp,
Nsp12) and the helicase (Nsp13). Inhibition of Mpro would prevent the virus from
replication and therefore constitutes one of the potential anti-coronaviral strategies.7-9
Due to the close phylogenetic relationship between SARS-CoV-2 and SARSCoV,3,10,11 their main proteases share many structural and functional features. From
the perspective of the design and synthesis of new Mpro inhibitors, a key feature of both
the enzymes is their ability to cleave the peptide bond following Gln. The SARS-CoV
Mpro cleaves polyproteins within the Leu-Gln↓(Ser, Ala, Gly) sequence (↓ indicates the
cleavage site), which appears to be a conserved pattern of this protease.7,9,12 The
specificity for peptide bond hydrolysis after Gln residues is also observed for main
proteases of other coronaviruses13,14 but is unknown for human enzymes. This
observation, along with further studies on the Mpro, can potentially lead to new broadspectrum anti-coronaviral inhibitors with minimum side effects.15
In the present study, we applied the HyCoSuL (Hybrid Combinatorial Substrate
Library) approach to determine the full substrate specificity profile of SARS-CoV and
SARS-CoV-2 Mpros. The use of natural and a large number of unnatural amino acids
with diverse chemical structures allowed an in-depth characterization of the residue
preference of the binding pockets within the substrate-binding site of the proteases.
The results from library screening enabled us to design and synthesize ACC-labeled

substrates with improved catalytic efficiency in comparison to a substrate containing
only natural amino acids. Moreover, results from our studies clearly indicate that
SARS-CoV Mpro and SARS-CoV-2 Mpro exhibit highly overlapping substrate specificity.
We have used this knowledge to design activity-based probes (ABPs) specific for the
SARS-CoV-2 Mpro as well as a peptidomimetic inhibitor. Further, we present a crystal
structure of the SARS-CoV-2 Mpro in complex with the ABP. Finally, using an ABP, we
were able to visualize active SARS-CoV-2 Mpro within nasopharyngeal epithelial cells
of the patient with active COVID-19 infection. These data provide a useful basis for the
design of chemical compounds for effective diagnosis and therapy of COVID-19.

Results and Discussion
Substrate specificity of SARS-CoV Mpro and SARS-CoV-2 Mpro
To determine the SARS-CoV Mpro and SARS-CoV-2 Mpro substrate preferences,
we applied a hybrid combinatorial substrate library (HyCoSuL) approach. The library
consists of three sublibraries, each of them comprising a fluorescent tag – ACC (7amino-4-carbamoylmethylcoumarin) – , two fixed positions and two varied positions
containing an equimolar mixture of 19 amino acids (Mix) (P2 sublibrary: Ac-Mix-Mix-XGln-ACC, P3 sublibrary: Ac-Mix-X-Mix-Gln-ACC, P4 sublibrary: Ac-X-Mix-Mix-GlnACC, X =19 natural and over 100 unnatural amino acids, Figure 1). We incorporated
glutamine at the P1 position, because the available crystal structures of SARS-CoV
Mpro revealed that only glutamine (and, at only one cleavage site, histidine) can occupy
the S1 pocket of this enzyme.12,16 The imidazole of His163, located at the very bottom
of the S1 pocket, is suitably positioned to interact with the Gln side chain. The Gln is
also involved in two other interactions, i.e. with the main chain of F140 and the side
chain of Glu166. The library screen revealed that SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 Mpro
display very similar substrate specificity, however SARS-CoV-2 Mpro possesses
broader substrate preferences at the P2 position (Figure 2). The most preferred amino
acid at the P2 position is leucine in case of both proteases. SARS-CoV Mpro exhibits
lower activity toward other tested amino acids at this position (<30%). Leu selectivity
for SARS-CoV Mpro is in high agreement with a previous report by Zhu et al..17
However, we have noticed some discrepancies in the level of selectivity for other
natural amino acids. This is the result of differences in the substrate specificity profiling
approach, where we are using a combinatorial mixture of natural amino acids, while

Zhu et al. were using a defined peptide sequence. Nevertheless, in both approaches,
preferences for the same natural amino acids was observed. The S2 pocket of both
investigated enzymes can accommodate other hydrophobic residues, such as 2-Abz,
Phe(4-NO2), 3-Abz, β-Ala, Dht, hLeu, Met, and Ile (amino acid structures are presented
in Table S1, SI). At the P3 position, both enzymes prefer hydrophobic D and L amino
acids and also positively charged residues; the best are: Tle, D-Phe, D-Tyr, Orn, hArg,
Dab, Dht, Lys, D-Phg, D-Trp, Arg, and Met(O)2. At the P4 position, SARS-CoV and
SARS-CoV-2 Mpro possess broad substrate specificity. The most preferred are small
aliphatic residues such as Abu, Val, Ala, and Tle, but other hydrophobic amino acids
are also accepted. These findings can be partly explained by the available crystal
structures of SARS-CoV Mpro in complex with inhibitors.8,12,16 The hydrophobic S2
subsite of SARS-CoV Mpro is more flexible compared to alphacoronavirus Mpros, which
explains less stringent specificity.15 The S2 pocket can form hydrophobic interactions
with P2 residues that are not only limited to leucine. The S3 pocket of SARS Mpro is not
well defined which is also reflected in our P3 substrate specificity profile. The S4 pocket
can be occupied by small residues due to the crowded cavity formed by P168, L167 at
the bottom and T190, A191 at the top wall.

To validate the results from library screening, we designed and synthesized
ACC-labeled substrates containing the most preferred amino acids in each position.
Then, we measured the rate of substrate hydrolysis relevant to each protease (Figure
3). The data clearly demonstrate that SARS-CoV Mpro and SARS-CoV-2 Mpro exhibit
the same activity toward tested substrates. The results are consistent with the
HyCoSuL screening data. The most preferred substrate, Ac-Abu-Tle-Leu-Gln-ACC, is
composed of the best amino acids in each position (Table 1). Kinetic parameters were
determined for the two best substrates (Ac-Abu-Tle-Leu-Gln-ACC, Ac-Thz-Tle-LeuGln-ACC) and one containing the best recognized natural amino acids (Ac-Val-LysLeu-Gln-ACC) (Table 2) toward SARS-CoV-2 Mpro. Due to substrate precipitation
because of high concentration needed in the assay, kinetic parameters toward SARSCoV Mpro could not be determined. Analysis of kinetic parameters revealed that these
three substrates differ in the kcat value, while KM values are comparable.

Inhibitors and activity-based probes of SARS-CoV-2 Mpro
In the next step, the best substrate QS1 was converted to an inhibitor and
activity-based probes. The inhibitor contained the acetylated peptide sequence and
vinyl sulfone as an irreversible reactive group (Ac-Abu-Tle-Leu-Gln-VS, Ac-QS1-VS,
Figure 4A). Probes included a N-terminal biotin tag or Cyanine 5 dye, polyethylene
glycol (PEG(4)) as a linker, the best peptide sequence, and vinyl sulfone (Figure 4A).
To evaluate the sensitivity of designed probes, we performed SDS-PAGE analysis
followed by protein transfer onto membranes and ABP visualization. We observed
SARS-CoV-2 Mpro (100 nM) labelling by Cy5-QS1-VS at a concentration of 100 nM and
by B-QS1-VS at 200 nM (Figure 4B) which reflected the results of the kobs/I analysis
(Table 3). To determine probe selectivity, we performed cell lysate assays. A HeLa
lysate was incubated with different probe concentrations (50, 100, and 200 nM) (Figure
4C). The cell lysate experiment confirmed probe selectivity. To verify that unknown
bands (about 30 kDa and between 49 and 62 kDa) were due to unspecific Cy5
labelling, we incubated the cell lysate with inhibitor (Ac-QS1-VS) for 30 min at 37°C
and then with Cy5-QS1-VS for 15 min at 37°C (lanes 8-10 on the membrane, Figure
4C). The same protein bands were observed on the membrane when cell lysates were
incubated with and without Ac-QS1-VS, which confirmed unspecific protein labelling
by the Cy5 dye.

Crystal structure of SARS-CoV-2 Mpro with the activity-based probe, BiotinPEG(4)-Abu-Tle-Leu-Gln-VS (B-QS1-VS)
To visualize the steric details of the interactions between the Mpro and the
activity-based probe, Biotin-PEG(4)-Abu-Tle-Leu-Gln-VS (B-QS1-VS), we determined
the X-ray crystal structure of the complex between the two components. The probe
was cocrystallized with the recombinant and highly purified SARS-CoV-2 Mpro. Crystals
diffracted to 1.7 Å resolution and were of space group P6122, with one ABP-Mpro
monomer per asymmetric unit (see Table S2 for crystallographic details). The structure
was refined to reasonable R factors and good geometry. Surprisingly, all atoms of the
activity-based probe (ABP) were clearly seen in the 2Fo-Fc electron density at a
contouring level of 0.5s. The reason for this is that the flexible tail of the ABP, the
PEG(4) chain and the terminal biotin label, are in contact with a neighboring Mpro dimer
in the crystal lattice (Fig. S1A). This is of course of little relevance for the situation in
solution; hence we discuss only the interaction of the P1-P4 residues with the parent
Mpro molecule (Fig. 5) here. The oxygen atoms of the vinylsulfone group point towards
the oxyanion hole of the protease and accept hydrogen bonds (2.81 Å and 3.26 Å)
from the main-chain amide groups of Gly143 and Cys145, respectively. Also, the sidechain amide-nitrogen of Asn142 donates a 2.90-Å H-bond to one of these oxygens.
The methyl group attached to the sulfone makes hydrophobic contacts with the Cg2
atom of Thr25 and the side-chain of Leu27, within the S1' subsite. The catalytic
cysteine residue is covalently linked to the Cb atom of the vinyl group, at a distance of
1.83 Å.
The P1-glutamine side-chain makes the expected interaction with His163 (2.72
Å, through the Oe1 atom) and the Phe140 main-chain oxygen (3.22 Å, through Ne2)
and Glu166 Oe1 (3.25 Å). The Ne2 of the P1-Gln thus donates a three-center
(bifurcated) hydrogen bond to these two acceptors. This is also reflected in inhibitors
that carry a g-lactam as Gln surrogate in the P1 position, such as compound 13b.7 The
Leu residue in the S2 pocket makes the canonical interactions previously observed17,

with residues Met49, Met165, His41, and the Ca atom of Arg188. Also, the main-chain
amide of the P2-Leu donates a 2.98-Å H-bond to the side-chain Oe1 of Gln189.
There is no well-defined pocket for the P3 moiety, which is therefore mostly
solvent-exposed. There may be some weak interaction of the Tle side-chain with the
hydrophobic portion of the neighboring Glu166 side-chain. The polar main-chain atoms
of the P3 residue form hydrogen-bonds with the protein main chain at Glu166. The
aminobutyric acid in P4 makes weak hydrophobic interactions with Leu167 and
Gln189, and its main-chain NH group donates a H-bond to Thr190 O.
We have previously noticed that compared to the SARS-CoV Mpro, Thr285 has
been replaced by Ala in SARS-CoV Mpro, and the neighboring Ile286 by Leu.7 In the
SARS-CoV Mpro, the Thr285 makes a hydrogen bond with its symmetry-mate across
the two-fold axis creating the Mpro dimer. The loss of this H-bond in the SARS-CoV-2
Mpro enables the monomers of the dimer to approach each other more closely.
Interestingly, in the crystal structure presented here, the space between the two
protomers generated by the mutation is filled by a chloride ion adopted from the
crystallization buffer (Fig. S1B). This might be taken as a hint for this region around
residues 284 - 286 being a hotspot for mutations, due to non-ideal packing of the two
protomers of the dimer at this point.

of the ABP is shown at a contouring level of 2.5s. All parts of the ABP beyond the P4
residue would be outside the parent Mpro dimer and have been omitted from this figure.

visualization of many proteases in the past18-20. We wanted to see if the Cy5-QS1-VS
developed by us can be used for detection of SARS-CoV-2 Mpro in human samples.
Thus, we recruited one patient with mild symptoms of COVID-19, who was positive for
SARS-CoV-2 RNA in two independent quantitative RT-PCR assays valid for diagnostic
purposes. We incubated the probe at 2 µM final concentration with cells collected from
nasopharyngeal swabs of the patient un the first and fifth day after diagnosis and
subjected them to confocal laser scanning microscopy. In parallel, we carried out the
same experiment with a healthy donor (COVID-19-negative control). These serial
measurements revealed that 10-15% of the cells were positive for staining with Cy5QS1-VS probe in the COVID-19 positive patient (Figure 6). A particularly strong signal
from SARS-CoV-2 Mpro was observed on the 5th day after diagnosis suggesting a very
advanced stage of the infection. No signal from SARS-CoV-2 Mpro labelling was
observed in the sample from the healthy donor (Figure 6). Thus, we were able to show
for the first time that human cells collected ex vivo contain active SARS-CoV-2 Mpro
during SARS-CoV-2 infection.

Discussion
SARS-CoV-2 first observed in Wuhan, China, caused a global pandemic leading
to COVID-19 disease. The lack of a vaccine and approved medications for direct
treatment of the disease has led to strenuous efforts to find therapies to stop the
pandemic. One of the promising therapeutic targets are two viral proteases - SARSCoV Mpro and SARS-CoV-2-PLpro. The first of these, SARS-CoV-2-Mpro, is used by the
virus for protein maturation and its structure has already been described recently9.
Moreover, the results of retargeting about 10,000 drugs, drugs candidates in clinical
trials and other bioactive compounds resulted in selection of several candidates as
potential inhibitors of this enzyme21. In our research, we decided to thoroughly examine
SARS-CoV Mpro to find the optimal chemical tools in the form of substrates, inhibitors
and activity-based probes. First, we have obtained a targeted library of fluorogenic
substrates (HyCoSuL) towards this protease and determined the substrate specificity
at the P4-P2 positions. We have directly compared the substrate specificity of the main
protease with the same protease from previous SARS, which caused an epidemy in
2003. Our data clearly demonstrate that these enzymes have very similar preferences
for natural and unnatural amino acids in the P4-P2 positions. They tolerate many
different amino acids at P4 and P3, and have a strong preference for Leu at P2. This
information is certainly crucial for the aspect of drug retargeting, but also the use of
information obtained in previous years for SARS-CoV Mpro to be used for current
research. In the next step, we created potent inhibitors and activity-based probes,
whose sequences were based on the HyCoSuL screening results. In the case of BQS1-VS, we also obtained a crystal structure from SARS-CoV-2 Mpro, which accurately
shows the binding mechanism in the P4-P1` pockets. This knowledge certainly
complements the information already obtained for other inhibitor molecules published
for this enzyme. In turn, we used the fluorescent activity-based probe to visualize the
SARS-CoV-2 Mpro activity in patient samples with COVID-19, thus confirming that it is

an excellent tool that can be used to detect this enzyme, and also be used as a
diagnostic tool.
In conclusion, our research allowed the exact characterization of SARS-CoV-2
Mpro in terms of both amino-acid preferences as well as design of targeted inhibitors
and activity-based probes. The reagents described here can be used to optimize
structures that lead to anti-COVID-19 drugs, as well as further drug retargeting.

Combinatorial library synthesis
Synthesis of H2N-ACC-resin. ACC synthesis was carried out according to Maly et
al.22 To a glass reaction vessel, 1 eq (9.62 mmol, 13 g) of Rink AM resin was added
and stirred gently once per 10 min in DCM for 1 h, then filtered and washed 3 times
with DMF. Fmoc-group deprotection was performed using 20% piperidine in DMF
(three cycles: 5, 5, and 25 min), filtered and washed with DMF each time (six times).
Next, 2.5 eq of Fmoc-ACC-OH (24.05 mmol, 10.64 g) was preactivated with 2.5 eq
HOBt monohydrate (24.05 mmol, 3.61 g) and 2.5 eq DICI (24.05 mmol, 3.75 mL) in
DMF and the slurry was added to the resin. The reaction was shaked gently for 24
hours at room temperature. After this time, the resin was washed four times with DMF
and the reaction was repeated using 1.5 eq of above reagents in order to improve the
yield of ACC coupling to the resin. After 24 hours, the resin was washed with DMF and
the Fmoc protecting group was removed using 20% piperidine in DMF (5, 5, and 25
min), filtered and washed with DMF (six times).
Synthesis of H2N-Gln(Trt)-ACC-resin. 2.5 eq Fmoc-Gln(Trt)-OH (24.05 mmol, 14.69
g) with 2.5 eq HATU (24.05 mmol, 9.15 g), 2.5 eq collidine (24.05 mmol, 3.18 mL) in
DMF were activated for 2 min and added to filter cannula with 1 eq (9.62 mmol) H2NACC-resin and the reaction was carried out for 24 h. Next, the resin was washed four
times with DMF and the same reaction was performed again using 1.5 eq of above
reagents. After four DMF washes, the Fmoc protecting group was removed using 20%
piperidine in DMF (5, 5, and 25 min). Subsequently, the resin was washed with DCM
(3 times) and MeOH (3 times) and dried over P2O5. The synthesis of P2, P3, and P4
sublibraries is exemplified in detail with the P2 sublibrary. The P2 library consisted of
137 compounds where all of the natural amino acids (omitting cysteine) and a pool of
unnatural amino acids were used at a defined position (in this case, the P2 position)
and an isokinetic mixture of 19 amino acids (without cysteine; plus norleucine
mimicking methionine) was coupled in the remaining positions (in case of the P2
sublibrary, positions P3 and P4 were occupied by an isokinetic mixture). Equivalent
ratios of amino acids in the isokinetic mixture were defined based on their reported
coupling rates. A fivefold excess (over the resin load) of the mixture was used. For

fixed positions, 2.5 eq of single amino acid was used. All reactions were performed
with the use of the coupling reagents DICI and HOBt. For P2 coupling, the synthesis
of the library was performed using a MultiChem 48-well synthesis apparatus
(FlexChem from SciGene, Sunnyvale, CA, USA). To each well of the reaction
apparatus, 1 eq of dry H2N-Gln(Trt)-ACC-resin (0.059 mmol, 80 mg) was added and
stirred gently for 30 minutes in DCM, and then washed four times with DMF. In
separate Eppendorf tubes, 2.5 eq (0.15 mmol) Fmoc-P2-OH was preactivated with 2.5
eq HOBt (0.15 mmol, 22.5 mg) and 2.5 eq DICI (0.15 mmol, 23.55 µL) in DMF. Next,
preactivated amino acids were added to wells of the apparatus containing H2NGln(Trt)-ACC-resin, followed by 3 h of agitation at room temperature. Then, the
reaction mixture was filtered, washed with DMF (4 times), and the ninhydrin test was
carried out in order to confirm P2-amino acid coupling. Subsequently, Fmoc protecting
groups were removed with the use of 20% piperidine in DMF (5, 5, and 25 min). For
P3 and P4 position coupling, an isokinetic mixture for 48 portions was prepared from
18 Fmoc-protected natural amino acids (omitting cysteine; plus norleucine mimicking
methionine; 19 amino acids in total). Next, 5 eq of isokinetic mixture, 5 eq HOBt (14.16
mmol, 2.13 g), and 5 eq DICI (14.16 mmol, 2.22 mL) were diluted in DMF and
preactivated for 3 min. The activated isokinetic mixture was added to each of 48 wells
containing 1 eq of H2N-P2-Gln(Trt)-ACC-resin. After 3 h of gentle agitation, the slurry
was filtered off and washed with DMF (4 times). A ninhydrin test was carried out and
the Fmoc protecting group was removed using 20% piperidine in DMF (5, 5, and 25
min). The same procedure was applied for the remaining compounds. The isokinetic
mixture was added to prepare the P4 position in the same manner as for the P3
position. In the last step of the synthesis, N-terminal acetylation was performed; to
prepare the mixture for 48 compounds, 5 eq of AcOH (14.16 mmol, 807 µL), 5 eq HBTU
(14.16 mmol, 5.37 g), and 5 eq DIPEA (14.16 mmol, 2.44 mL) in ~45 mL of DMF were
added to a 50-mL falcon tube. After gentle stirring for 1 min, the mixture (~800 µL) was
added to each well in the reaction apparatus, containing the H2N-Mix-Mix-P2-Gln(Trt)ACC-resin, followed by gentle agitation for 30 min. Next, the resin was washed six
times with DMF, three times with DCM, three times with MeOH, and dried over P2O5.
After completing the synthesis, peptides were cleaved from the resin with a mixture of
cold TFA:TIPS:H2O (%, v/v/v 95:2.5:2.5; 2 mL/well; 2 hours, shaking once per 15 min).
The solution from each well was collected separately and the resin was washed once
with a portion of fresh cleavage solution (1 mL), followed by addition of diethyl ether

(Et2O, 14 mL) into falcons with peptides in solution. After precipitation (30 min at 20°C), the mixture was centrifuged and washed again with Et2O (5 mL). After
centrifugation, the supernatant was removed and the remaining white precipitate was
dissolved in ACN/H2O (v/v, 3/1) and lyophilized. The products were dissolved in DMSO
to a final concentration of 10 mM and used without further purification. The synthesis
of P3 and P4 sublibraries was performed in the same manner as described above; P3
and P4 sublibraries were synthesized by coupling fixed amino-acid residues to P3
(isokinetic mixture coupled to P2 and P4) and P4 position (isokinetic mixture coupled
to P2 and P3).
Library screening
Hybrid

screening

was

performed

using

a

spectrofluorometer (Molecular Devices Spectramax Gemini XPS) in 384-well plates
(Corning). The assay conditions were as follows: 1 µL of substrate and 49 µL of
enzyme, which was incubated at 37°C for 10 min in assay buffer (20 mM Tris, 150 mM
NaCl, 1 mM EDTA, 1 mM DTT, pH 7.3). The final substrate concentration was 100 µM
and the final enzyme concentration was 1 µM SARS-CoV and 0.6 µM SARS-CoV-2
Mpro, respectively. The release of ACC was measured for 45 min (λex = 355 nm, λem =
460 nm) and the linear part of each progress curve was used to determine the
substrate hydrolysis rate. Substrate specificity profiles were established by setting the
highest value of relative fluorescence unit per second (RFU/s) from each position as
100% and others were adjusted accordingly.
Individual substrate synthesis
ACC-labeled substrates were synthesized on the solid support according to the solid
phase peptide synthesis method described elsewhere.18 In brief, Fmoc-ACC-OH (2.5
eq) was attached to a Rink-amide resin using HOBt (2.5 eq) and DICI (2.5 eq) in DMF
as coupling reagents. Then, the Fmoc protecting group was removed using 20%
piperidine in DMF (three cycles: 5, 5, and 25 min). Fmoc-Gln(Trt)-OH (2.5 eq) was
coupled to the H2N-ACC-resin using HATU (2.5 eq) and 2,4,6-collidine (2.5 eq) in DMF.
After Fmoc group removal, Fmoc-P2-OH (2.5 eq) amino acid was attached (HOBt and
DICI (2.5 eq) in DMF). Amino acids in P3 and P4 positions were coupled in the same
manner. The free N-terminus was acetylated using HBTU, AcOH and DIPEA in DMF
(5 eq of each reagent). Then, the resin was washed five times with DMF, three times

with DCM and three times with MeOH, and dried over P2O5. Substrates were removed
from the resin with a mixture of TFA/TIPS/H2O (% v/v/v, 95:2.5:2.5), precipitated in
Et2O, purified on HPLC and lyophilized. The purity of each substrate was confirmed
using analytical HPLC. Each substrate was dissolved in DMSO at a final concentration
of 10 mM and stored at -80°C until use.
Kinetic analysis of substrates
Substrate screening was carried out in the same manner as the library assay.
Substrate concentration was 5 µM, SARS-CoV Mpro was 0.3 µM and SARS-CoV-2 Mpro
was 0.3 µM. Substrate hydrolysis was measured for 30 min using the following
wavelengths: λex = 355 nm, λem = 460 nm. The experiment was repeated three times.
Results were presented as mean values with standard deviations. Kinetic parameters
were assayed in 96-well plates (Corning). Wells contained 80 µL of enzyme in assay
buffer (0.074-0.1 µM SARS-CoV-2 Mpro) and 20 µL of substrate at eight different
concentrations ranging from 58.5 µM to 1200 µM. ACC liberation was monitored for 30
min (λex = 355 nm, λem = 460 nm). Each experiment was repeated at least three times.
Kinetic parameters were determined using the Michaelis-Menten equation and
GraphPad Prism software.
Activity-based probe and inhibitor synthesis
The synthesis of the biotinylated activity-based probe involved three sequential steps.
In the first step, the Biotin-PEG(4)-Abu-Tle-Leu-OH fragment was synthesized using a
2-chlorotrityl chloride resin. Fmoc-Leu-OH (2.5 eq) was dissolved in anhydrous DCM,
pre-activated with DIPEA (3 eq) and added to the cartridge with resin (1 eq). After 3h,
the mixture was filtered, washed 3 times with DCM and 3 times with DMF, and the
Fmoc group was removed using 20% piperidine in DMF. Fmoc-Tle-OH, Fmoc-Abu-OH
and Fmoc-PEG(4)-OH were attached to the resin using HATU (2.5 eq) and 2,4,6collidine (2.5 eq) in DMF as coupling reagents. The biotin tag was coupled to H2NPEG(4)-Abu-Tle-Leu-resin using 2.5 eq HBTU and 2.5 eq DIPEA in a DMF:DMSO
mixture (1:1, v/v). After 3 h, the resin was washed 3 times with DMF, 3 times with DCM,
and 3 times with MeOH and dried over P2O5. Finally, the peptide fragment was
removed from the resin with a mixture of DCM/TFE/AcOH (v/v/v, 8:1:1). The solution
was filtered and concentrated. The obtained crude peptide was dissolved in ACN:H2O
(v/v, 3:1), lyophilized, and then used without further purification (purity > 95%). In the

second step, Fmoc-Gln(Trt)-VS was synthesized in the same manner as described
elsewhere23. In the third step, the Fmoc group was removed from Fmoc-Gln(Trt)-VS
using a mixture of diethylamine:ACN (1:1, v/v). Biotin-PEG(4)-Abu-Tle-Leu-OH was
pre-activated with HATU (1.2 eq) and 2,4,6-collidine (3 eq) in DMF and attached to the
H2N-Gln(Trt)-VS (1 eq). The reaction was agitated for 2 h and the product was purified
on HPLC. Finally, Biotin-PEG(4)-Abu-Tle-Leu-Gln(Trt)-VS was treated with a mixture
of TFA/DCM/TIPS (% v/v/v/ 70:27:3) to remove the Trt group. After 40 min, solvents
were evaporated and the probe was purified on HPLC.
Ac-Abu-Tle-Leu-Gln-VS and Cy5-PEG(4)-Abu-Tle-Leu-Gln-VS were synthesized in
the same manner, but Boc-PEG(4)-Abu-Tle-Leu-OH and Ac-Abu-Tle-Leu-OH were
synthesized on the 2-chlorotrityl chloride resin instead of Biotin-PEG(4)-Abu-Tle-LeuOH.
Determination of inhibition kinetics (kobs/I) for inhibitor and activity-based
probes
SARS-CoV-2 Mpro (75 nM) was preincubated in assay buffer 20 mM Tris, 150 mM NaCl,
1 mM EDTA, 1 mM DTT, pH 7.3 for 10 min at 37°C. Then, the enzyme was added to
wells containing seven different concentrations of inhibitor or probe (ranging from 3.9
µM to 20 µM) and 50 μM of substrate (QS1). The measurement was conducted for 30
minutes and repeated at least three times; kobs/I was calculated as previously
described.24
SARS-CoV-2 Mpro labelling
SARS-CoV-2 Mpro (50, 100, or 200 nM) was incubated with different probe
concentrations (50-2000 nM) in assay buffer (20 mM Tris, 150 mM NaCl, 1 mM EDTA,
1 mM DTT, pH 7.3) for 15 min at 37°C. Then 3x SDS/DTT was added, and the samples
were boiled for 5 min at 95°C and resolved on 4-12% Bis-Tris Plus 12-well gels at 30
µL sample/well. Electrophoresis was performed at 200 V for 29 min. Next, the proteins
were transferred to a nitrocellulose membrane (0.2 µm, Bio-Rad) for 60 min at 10 V.
The membrane was blocked with 2% BSA in Tris-buffered saline with 0.1% (v/v) Tween
20 (TBS-T) for 60 min at RT. The biotinylated activity-based probe was detected with
a fluorescent streptavidin Alexa Fluor 647 conjugate (1:10000) in TBS-T with 1% BSA

Software.

SARS-CoV-2 Mpro labelling in HeLa lysates
HeLa cells were cultured in DMEM supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum, 2 mM
L-glutamine, and antibiotics (100 U/mL penicillin, 100 µg/mL streptomycin) in a
humidified 5% CO2 atmosphere at 37°C. Approximately 1,200,000 cells were
harvested and washed three times with PBS. The cell pellet was lysed in buffer
containing 20 mM Tris, 150 mM NaCl, and 5 mM DTT, pH 8.0, using a sonicator. The
cell lysate was centrifuged for 10 min, and the supernatant was collected. Twenty
microliters of cell lysate was incubated with or without 30 µL of inhibitor Ac-QS1-VS
and with or without SARS-CoV-2 Mpro (100 nM) for 30 min at 37°C. Next, 50 µL of BQS1-VS or Cy5-QS1-VS at different concentrations was added to the samples and
they were incubated for 15 min at 37°C. Then the samples were combined with 50 µL
3xSDS/DTT, boiled, and run on a gel. Electrophoresis, protein transfer to a
nitrocellulose membrane, and probe visualization were conducted in the same manner
as described above.

Crystallization of SARS-CoV-2 Mpro in complex with biotin-PEG(4)-Abu-Tle-LeuGln-vinylsulfone
The purified SARS-CoV-2 Mpro was concentrated to 23 mg/mL, mixed with biotinPEG(4)-Abu-Tle-Leu-Gln-vinylsulfone at a molar ratio of 1:5, and the mixture was
incubated at 4oC overnight. The next day, the mixture was clarified by centrifugation at
12,000 x g, 4°C, and the supernatant was set for crystallization screening by using
commercially available screening kits (PEGRxTM 1 & 2 (Hampton Research) and
Morpheus HT-96 (Molecular Dimensions)). A Gryphon LCP crystallization robot (Art
Robbins) was used for setting up the crystallization screens with the sitting-drop vapordiffusion method at 18°C, where 0.15 μL of protein solution and 0.15 μL of reservoir
were mixed to equilibrate against 40 μL reservoir solution.
Crystals were observed under several conditions in the two 96-well plates. The
crystals were fished directly from the basic screening plates. The cryo-protectant

consisted of mother liquor plus varied concentrations (5% to 20%) of glycerol, and 2
mM of the activity-based probe (ABP). Subsequently, liquid nitrogen was used for
flash-cooling the crystals prior to data collection.
Diffraction data collection and determination of the structure
Several diffraction data sets were collected at 100 K at the P11 beamline of
PETRA III (DESY, Hamburg, Germany), using synchrotron radiation of wavelength
1.0332 Å and a Pilatus 6M detector (Dectris). For structure determination, a data set
was used that was collected using a crystal fished from the condition No. E7 of
Morpheus HT-96 (0.12 M ethylene glycols (0.3 M diethylene glycol, 0.3 M triethylene
glycol, 0.3 M tetraethylene glycol, 0.3 M pentaethylene glycol), 0.1 M buffer system 2
(1.0 M sodium HEPES, MOPS (acid), pH 7.5), pH 7.5, 30% precipitant mix 3 (20% v/v
glycerol, 10% PEG 4000)).
XDSapp,25 Pointless,26,27 and Scala26 (the latter two from the CCP4 suite28) were used
for processing and scaling the dataset. The space group was determined as P6122
and the resolution limit was set at a Bragg spacing of 1.70 Å. The molecular
replacement method was employed for phase determination using the Molrep
program28,29 and the free-enzyme crystal structure of SARS-CoV-2 Mpro (PDB entry
6Y2E;9) as a the search model. The geometric restraints for the activity-based probe
were generated using the Jligand programe from the CCP4 suite;28,30 the ABP was
built into the Fo-Fc density by using the Coot software.31 Structure refinement was
performed with Refmac5.28,31,32 Statistics of diffraction data processing and model
refinement are shown in Table S2.

Patient sample preparation. The study was approved by the Bioethics Committee of
the Medical University of Lodz, Poland (# RNN/114/20/KE). The study was conducted
in compliance with good clinical practice guidelines and under the principles of the
Declaration of Helsinki. The study participants or their parents provided written
informed consent. A 13-year old boy, who was positive for SARS-CoV-2 RNA in serial
measurements, was included in the study. This subject presented mild symptoms of
COVID-19 infection. Two nasopharyngeal swabs were collected twice during routine
clinical examination, at day 1 and 5 after COVID-19 diagnosis (positive SARS-CoV-2
RNA test).

Detection of SARS-CoV-2 Mpro in epithelial cells by immunofluorescence. The
nasopharyngeal swab was used for smear preparation for confocal laser scanning
microscopy. Smears were performed on glass slides covered with polylysine (Thermo
Fisher Scientific, MA, USA). These slides were treated with 2 µM probe of Mpro Cy5QS1-VS and incubated for 30 min at 37°C. Slides were fixed in 70% ethanol for 30
min. For further staining overnight at +4oC, incubation with recombinant goat antiACE2
antibody (R&D Systems, MN, USA, 1:20) was performed. The next day, antibodies
were aspirated, and cells were washed twice with PBS and labeled with a secondary
antibody (Alexa Fluor 488 donkey anti-Goat IgG (H+L) (A11055, 1:200, Life
Technologies) in PBS for 1 hour at room temperature. Next, the cells were washed
twice with PBS, coverslips were mounted with Vectashield fluorescence mounting
medium containing DAPI (Vector Lab. H-1000) and sealed with nail polish. Slides were
stored at +4°C until use. Cells were then subjected to confocal microscope analysis
using a Leica TCS SP8. DAPI was detected by the DAPI channel (405 nm), the Mpro
Cy5-QS1-VS probe was detected with the Cy5 filter single photon laser (658 nm), and
ACE2/secondary antibodies were read using the FITC filter (single photon laser: 458
nm). All images were acquired in .tiff format using Leica Application Suite X software.
Images shown are representative views of cells from two coverslips.
