Abstract

Viruses are the major aetiological agents of acute and chronic severe human diseases that
place a tremendous burden on global public health and economy; however, for most viruses,
effective prophylactics and therapeutics are lacking, in particular, broad-spectrum antiviral
agents. Herein, we identified 2 secreted bacterial lipases from a Chromobacterium bacterium,
named Chromobacterium antiviral effector-1 (CbAE-1) and CbAE-2, with a broad-spectrum
virucidal activity against dengue virus (DENV), Zika virus (ZIKV), severe acute respiratory
syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) and herpes
simplex virus (HSV). The CbAEs potently blocked viral infection in the extracellular milieu
through their lipase activity. Mechanistic studies showed that this lipase activity directly
disrupted the viral envelope structure, thus inactivating infectivity. A mutation of CbAE-1 in
its lipase motif fully abrogated the virucidal ability. Furthermore, CbAE-2 presented low
toxicity in vivo and in vitro, highlighting its potential as a broad-spectrum antiviral drug.

Main Text

Emerging and re-emerging viral diseases cause a major burden on global public health.
Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), a new severe acute respiratory disease caused by
severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), emerged at the end of
December 2019 and is now pandemic globally (Rothan and Byrareddy, 2020; Zheng, 2020).
As of May 9th, 2020, World Health Organization (WHO) has recorded 3,855,788 confirmed
cases and 265,862 deaths across over 200 countries (WHO, 2020). In addition, several highly
pathogenic viruses, such as human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), dengue virus (DENV),
severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV), Zika virus (ZIKV) and Ebola
virus (EBOV), suddenly emerged/re-emerged and disseminated rapidly (Cordova-Villalobos et
al., 2017; Holt, 2018; Obando-Pacheco et al., 2018; Oidtman et al., 2019). There are billions of
reported cases of viral infections annually, in which millions of patients suffer from severe
clinical symptoms and even death (Peteranderl et al., 2016; Sejvar, 2016; Song et al., 2017;
Stein et al., 2017). However, neither specific antiviral drugs nor vaccines will be immediately
available when a new virus emerges. Therefore, broad-spectrum antiviral agents are urgently
needed to control an emerging crisis of public health (Boldescu et al., 2017; Totura and Bavari,
2019; Zhu et al., 2015), thus reinforcing the arsenal of our antiviral options. Herein, we identify
2 secreted bacterial proteins from a Chromobacterium bacterium that can robustly resist
infections of DENV, ZIKV, SARS-CoV-2, HIV and herpes simplex virus-1 (HSV-1), suggesting
their potential as broad-spectrum antiviral agents.

Chromobacterium spp. constitute a genus of gram-negative bacteria that are occasionally
pathogenic to humans and animals. A soil bacterium named Chromobacterium sp. Panama
(Csp_P) identified from the midgut of a field-caught Aedes aegypti showed strong virucidal
activity against DENV (Caragata et al., 2020; Ramirez et al., 2014; Saraiva et al., 2018). In this
study, we first identified a Chromobacterium bacterium from the gut of A. aegypti mosquitoes
reared in our insectary facility. We thus refer to this bacterium as Chromobacterium sp. Beijing
(Csp_BJ). We sequenced the whole bacterial genome to characterize Csp_BJ and uploaded the
whole genome information into the NCBI database (NCBI Taxonomy ID: 2735795). Based on

genomic comparison, Csp_BJ shares either 99.48% identity to Chromobacterium
haemolyticum CH06-BL or 99.42% identity to Chromobacterium rhizoryzae JP2-74 strain.
Oral supplementation of this bacteria in A. aegypti largely impaired mosquito permissiveness
to DENV (Supplementary Figure 1A and 1B) and ZIKV (Supplementary Figure 1C and 1D),
suggesting a close relationship between the identified Csp_BJ and Csp_P strains. We next
aimed to understand how Csp_BJ resists viral infection in mosquitoes. Bacteria usually exploit
many effectors, such as cellular components, metabolites or secreted proteins, to regulate their
host immune or physiological status for effective colonization. We therefore identified the
bacterial effector(s) that modulate infection of DENV and ZIKV through differential
fragmentation. In this experiment, we cultured Csp_BJ for 24 hr at 30°C. The cell-free culture
supernatant was collected by centrifugation and filtration through a 0.22 µm filter unit, whereas
the cell lysates were generated by sonication. Either the bacterial cell lysate or the culture
supernatant was mixed with 50 plaque-forming units (pfu) of DENV or ZIKV and incubated
for 1 hr, and then the infectious viral particles were determined by a plaque forming assay
(Figure 1A). Incubation of the culture supernatant but not the bacterial lysates resulted in
significant suppression of DENV (Figure 1B) and ZIKV (Figure 1C) infectivity in Vero cells,
indicating that an extracellular effector(s) secreted by Csp_BJ was responsible for viral
inhibition. Next, we investigated whether the effector(s) was a secreted protein, small peptide,
lipid, polysaccharide or other metabolite. Therefore, the culture supernatant was separated
using a 3 kDa-cutoff filter (Wu et al., 2019). Either the upper retentate (proteins and large
peptides) or the lower liquid filtrate (small molecule compounds and short peptides) was mixed
with the viruses for incubation in Vero cells (Figure 1D). Intriguingly, inoculation of the
retentate rather than the filtrate inhibited the infectivity of DENV and ZIKV (Figure 1E and
1F), suggesting that the effector(s) might be a protein(s) secreted by Csp_BJ. Subsequently, the
protein components in the upper retentate were separated by SDS-PAGE and then identified by
mass spectrometry (Figure 2A). The highly abundant proteins with secretable properties were
selected, expressed and purified in an Escherichia coli expression system (Figure 2B). Of all
the proteins tested, the bacterial protein encoded by gene3771 (Accession: MT473992)
significantly impaired DENV and ZIKV infection in Vero cells (Figure 2C and 2D). We named
this protein Chromobacterium antiviral effector-1 (CbAE-1). Intriguingly, a CbAE-1

homologue with 55.61% amino acid identity named CbAE-2 (Accession: MT473995) was
further identified from Csp_BJ based on sequence comparison (Supplementary Figure 2A and
2B). Both effectors encoded a lipase domain with a typical GDSL motif (Casas-Godoy et al.,
2018). To further confirm the virucidal activity, both proteins were expressed and purified in E.
coli (Figure 2E). A serial concentration of recombinant proteins was mixed with 50 pfu of
DENV or ZIKV for plaque assay in Vero cells. The half-inhibitory concentration (IC50) of
CbAE-1 was 0.0016 µg/ml for DENV and 0.0026 µg/ml for ZIKV (Figure 2F and 2G). However,
the IC50 of CbAE-2 for both flaviviruses was 370-2400 times higher than that of CbAE-1,
indicating a much more robust virucidal activity of CbAE-1 against flaviviruses (Figure 2F and
2G). Thus, we identified 2 bacterial effectors with a high virucidal activity from a Csp_BJ
bacterium.

We next investigated the mechanisms by which these bacterial effectors resist viral
infection. According to sequence analysis, CbAEs contain a conserved lipase domain. Lipases
are a group of enzymes that catalyse the hydrolysis of the ester bond of glycerides into fatty
acids and glycerol (Casas-Godoy et al., 2018). We therefore assessed whether CbAEs have
lipase activity. In a plate degradation assay, both CbAEs directly digested egg yolk lipoproteins
and formed lytic halos whose diameters correlated with lipase activity (Figure 3A). The
sequence GDSL is the core motif of lipase activity (Casas-Godoy et al., 2018). Consistently, a
S187G mutation in this motif of CbAE-1 fully disrupted its lipase activity (Figure 3A),
validating CbAEs as secreted lipases of Csp_BJ.

Given their lipase activity, we hypothesized that CbAEs might use their enzymatic activity
to degrade viral lipid envelope, which may result in exposure of the viral RNA (Muller et al.,
2014). To address this hypothesis, serial concentrations of CbAEs were incubated with 1×104
pfu of DENV or ZIKV for 1 hr at 37°C. The mixture was then treated with RNase A to evaluate
the degradation of exposed viral genomic RNA. Compared to mock treatments in which the
viruses were incubated with BSA, a significant reduction in viral RNA was recorded by RTqPCR when the viruses were treated with CbAEs (Figure 3B and 3C), indicating that the lipase
activity of CbAEs directly disrupted the virion structure, thus resulting in viral genome release.

Consistent with these results, the S187G mutant of CbAE-1 that had no lipase activity
completely failed to suppress both DENV and ZIKV infection (Figure 3D and 3E), further
indicating that the virucidal activity of CbAEs is lipase-dependent. To validate that CbAEs
disrupt viral lipidic membranes, we incubated CbAE-1 with purified ZIKV virions and
processed the samples for transmission electron microscopy (Figure 3F). The ZIKV particle
typically has a diameter of 50–60 nm (Hasan et al., 2018) and, in consistent with that, we
observed intact viral particles in our control sample treated with 10 µg/ml BSA (Figure 3F).
However, upon treatment with 10 µg/ml CbAE-1 in the same buffer as BSA solution, the
integrity of ZIKV particles was fully disrupted (Figure 3F). This is in agreement with our
previous finding that treatment of CbAEs resulted in viral genome release. Since CbAEs
blocked viral infection in the extracellular milieu, we further assessed whether treatment of
CbAEs prior to viral inoculation could effectively block viral infection. We pre-treated Vero
cells with 10 µg/ml of purified CbAEs. Subsequently, 0.1 MOI of DENV or ZIKV was used to
challenge the CbAEs-treated cells. Pre-incubation with CbAE-1 fully blocked the infectivity of
both flaviviruses, whereas treatment with CbAE-2 exhibited 60%-80% inhibition (Figure 3F
and 3G).

Since the CbAEs showed a direct catalytic action on the viral lipid bilayer, we assessed
their virucidal activity against other enveloped viruses. SARS-CoV-2 is a newly emerging
coronavirus that causes the severe acute respiratory disease COVID-19. To date, no specific
therapeutics are available against SARS-CoV-2 infection. We therefore assessed the virucidal
effect of the CbAEs on SARS-CoV-2. In contrast to the large difference in virucidal activity
against flavivirus infection, both CbAEs presented a similar antiviral effect against a SARSCoV-2 pseudovirus in HEK-293T-ACE2 cells (Figure 4A). Consistently, infection with lowpassage SARS-CoV-2 in Vero cells was also significantly suppressed by treatment with the
CbAEs (Figure 4B). Additionally, both CbAEs showed broad-spectrum antiviral effects on
HIV-1 pseudoviruses (Figure 4C, 4D and 4E), as well as HSV-1 (Figure 4F). Notably, compared
to a HIV-neutralizing antibody (N6) with a near-pan neutralization breadth (Huang et al., 2016),
CbAEs were very potent with a much lower IC50 for 3 HIV pseudovirus strains (Figure 4C, 4D
and 4E). Nonetheless, it is puzzling that the CbAEs did not show any effect against infection

with influenza A virus (IAV) (Figure 4G).

The lipidic envelope of a viral particle is generally derived from the plasma membrane
or the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) membrane of a host cell. Thus, CbAEs can also act on host
cell membranes and their cytotoxicity to host cells may be a major concern for developing a
CbAE-based broad-spectrum antiviral drug. Generally, CbAE-1 showed much higher toxicity
than CbAE-2 on both Vero cells (Supplementary Figure 3A) and A549 human
adenocarcinomic epithelial cells

(Supplementary

Figure

3B).

The

half-cytotoxicity

concentration (CC50) of CbAE-2 was >1,000 µg/ml in the tested mammalian cells
(Supplementary Figure 3A and 3B). The selectivity index (SI = CC50/IC50) of CbAE-2
was >1000 for all the viruses/cells tested; while the SI of CbAE-1 ranges from 200 to 400,000.
We next assessed the toxicity of the CbAEs in ICR mice. The half-lethal dose (LD50) was either
91.05 µg/kg for CbAE-1 or 4000 µg/kg for CbAE-2 upon tail vein injection (Supplementary
Figure 3C). Nonetheless, the mice were much tolerant with a high dose of CbAEs via intranasal
inoculation. The animals intranasally treated with a high dose of CbAEs all survived and
maintained normal body weight (Supplementary Figure 3D). Altogether, these data suggest that
CbAE-2 is much safer than CbAE-1 to hosts, and thus could be a broad antiviral drug candidate.

In this study, we identified two virucidal effectors with lipase activity, CbAE-1 and CbAE2, from the Chromobacterium sp. Csp_BJ. Both CbAEs showed a potent virucidal activity
against a variety of enveloped viruses including DENV, ZIKV, SARS-CoV-2, HIV-1, and HSV1. Notably, neither CbAEs exhibited any effect against IAV. The toxicity assessment showed
that CbAE-2 was much safer than CbAE-1 to both human cells and mice. Indeed, accumulating
evidence indicates that certain lipases present a potent antiviral activity. Either lipoprotein
lipase or hepatic triglyceride lipase impaired hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection in human
Huh7.5 cells through degrading virus-associated lipoproteins (Shimizu et al., 2010). A secreted
phospholipase A2 (PLA2) isolated from Naja mossambica snake venom showed a potent
virucidal activity against HCV, DENV, and Japanese encephalitis virus (JEV); while the
protein did not exhibit significant antiviral activity against Sindbis virus (SINV), IAV, Middle
East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) or HSV-1 (Chen et al., 2017). A secreted

human PLA2 has been shown to neutralize HIV-1 by degrading the viral membrane (Kim et
al., 2007) or by blocking viral entry into host cells rather than a lipase-mediated virucidal effect
(Fenard et al., 1999), suggesting diverse virucidal mechanisms by PLA2. CbAEs may inactivate
viruses by their lipase activity that also damage cellular membranes; nonetheless, their
specificity and affinity for the viral envelope could be significantly improved, thus further
reducing their cytotoxicity and increasing virucidal efficacy. For example, the SARS-CoV-2
surface protein Spike binds to human ACE2 with high affinity (Wang et al., 2020), and thus
soluble ACE2 could be engineered with CbAEs to greatly enhance its affinity and specificity
for the viral envelope. Given that human recombinant soluble ACE2 can also inhibit SARSCoV-2 infection in organoids (Monteil et al., 2020), it is possible that a soluble ACE2-CbAE
construction may have improved efficacy in blocking SARS-CoV-2 infections.

Viruses are the major aetiological agents of acute severe human diseases that impose a
tremendous burden on the global public health and economy (Ghosn et al., 2018; Girard et al.,
2010; Wilder-Smith et al., 2017). Given the fact that development of virus-specific vaccines
and antiviral drugs is usually lengthy, broad-spectrum antiviral drugs could be crucial to prevent
wide spread of new viral disease in a timely manner (Schein, 2020). CbAE-2, with a broad
antiviral effect and low toxicity to hosts, could be a potential choice. Our study provides a future
avenue for the development of broad-spectrum antiviral drugs that might reduce the clinical
burden caused by emerging viral diseases.

Ethics statement.
Human blood was collected from healthy donors who provided written informed consents. The
collection of human blood samples and their use for mosquito feeding was approved by the
local ethics committee at Tsinghua University.

Mice, mosquitoes, cells, viruses and bacteria.
Eight-week-old female ICR mice purchased from Vital River Laboratories in China were used
for toxicity assay. The mice were maintained in a specific pathogen-free barrier facility at
Tsinghua University. The animal protocol used in this study was approved by the Institutional
Animal Care and Use Committee of Tsinghua University and performed in accordance with
their guidelines. Aedes aegypti (the Rockefeller strain) was maintained on a sugar solution in a
low-temperature, illuminated incubator (Model 818, Thermo Electron Corporation) at 28°C
and 80% humidity, according to standard rearing procedures (Cheng et al., 2010). Vero cells,
HEK-293T cells and A549 cells were maintained in Dulbecco’s modified Eagle’s medium
(11965-092, Gibco) supplemented with 10% heat-inactivated foetal bovine serum (16000-044,
Gibco) and 1% antibiotic-antimycotic (15240-062, Invitrogen) in a humidified 5% (V/V) CO2
incubator at 37°C. The Vero, HEK-293T and A549 cell lines were purchased from the ATCC
(CCL-81, CRL-3216 and CCL-185, respectively). DENV-2 (New Guinea C strain), ZIKV
(PRVABC59 strain), HSV-1, IAV (H1N1 PR8 strain) and SARS-CoV-2 were grown in Vero
cells with VP-SFM medium (11681-020, Gibco). DENV, ZIKV, HSV and SARS-CoV-2 were
titrated by a standard plaque formation assay on Vero cells (Bai et al., 2007). IAV were titrated
using a standard 50% tissue culture infection dose (TCID50) assay (Teferedegne et al., 2013;
Varada et al., 2013). All experiments involving infectious SARS-CoV-2 were performed in a
biosafety level 3 (BSL3) containment laboratory. Chromobacterium sp. Beijing was grown in
LB broth at 30°C for 24 hr at 250 rpm. Culture supernatants were obtained by centrifugation
and filtering the supernatant through a 0.22 µm filter unit (SLGP033RS, Millipore).

Mass spectrometry.

Chromobacterium sp. Beijing was washed three times with PBS and suspended in 10 ml of VPSFM medium. After incubation for 2 hr at 37°C, the bacteria were pelleted and removed by
centrifugation and filtration using a 0.22 µm filter unit (SLGP033RS, Millipore). The protein
component of the bacterial supernatant was concentrated using an Ultra-15 centrifugal filter
concentrator (UFC900396, Amicon) and subjected to SDS-PAGE. Fresh VP-SFM medium
served as a negative control. The whole gel lane was excised and analysed by liquid
chromatography-mass spectrometry (LC-MS) at the Protein Chemistry Technology Core,
Tsinghua University. The MS readouts were searched against the protein sequence database of
Chromobacterium spp. at the UniProt Database using Mascot software. The secreted proteins
with a score ≥ 800 were included in the subsequent investigation.

Protein expression and purification.
The genes identified from mass spectrometry were amplified from Csp_BJ cDNA and cloned
into the pET-28a (+) expression vector. Recombinant proteins were induced to be expressed in
the E. coli BL21 DE3 strain using 200 mM IPTG for protein expression for the soluble form
and 500 mM IPTG for inclusion bodies. The proteins were induced by 200 mM IPTG overnight
at 16°C to generate soluble forms and purified with TALON metal affinity resin (635501,
Clontech). The proteins were eluted with 250 mM imidazole and subsequently dialyzed in PBS
buffer (pH 7.4). The inclusion bodies were washed with lysis buffer (50 mM Tris, 150 mM
NaCl, 5 mM CaCl2, 5% Triton X-100 and 1 mM DTT) 3 times and 2 M urea 1 time, dissolved
in 8 M urea and dialyzed overnight in renaturation buffer. Endotoxin was removed (L00338,
GenScript) before the protein concentration was measured using a Bradford assay (500-0006,
Bio-Rad), and the protein purity was checked with SDS-PAGE.

Plaque reduction neutralization tests (PRNTs).
Vero cells were seeded at ~4×105 cells per well in 6-well plates and then incubated at 37°C
overnight before reaching 80–90% confluence. DENV, ZIKV, HSV-1 and SARS-CoV-2 virus
stocks were diluted to 50 plaque-forming units (pfu) per ml and incubated untreated or with a
serial dilution of the CbAEs in five-fold steps at 37°C for 1 hr before being added onto Vero
cell monolayers for 2 hr of infection. Cell monolayers were washed once with PBS and covered

with 1% agarose overlay DMEM with 2% FBS. After 4-5 dpi (DENV, ZIKV and HSV-1) or 23 dpi (SARS-CoV-2), Vero cell monolayers were fixed and stained with 0.8% crystal violet,
and the number of pfu per ml was determined. The concentration of each protein necessary to
inhibit virus infection by 50% (IC50) was calculated by comparison with the untreated cells
using the dose-response-inhibition model in GraphPad Prism 8.0 (GraphPad Software, USA).

Pre-treatment virus inhibition assays.
For pre-infection treatment, Vero cells were seeded in 24-well plates and allowed to form
monolayers. Ten micrograms/ml CbAE-1 or CbAE-2 was added to Vero cell monolayers at
37°C for 1 hr, and then DENV or ZIKV (0.1 MOI) was added and incubated for another hour
at 37°C. After infection, cell monolayers were washed once with PBS buffer, fresh VP-SFM
medium was added, and the cells were incubated at 37°C for 48 hr before the supernatant was
collected for RT-qPCR quantitation of the viral genome.

Viral genome quantitation by RT-qPCR.
Total RNA was isolated either from homogenized mosquitoes or infected cell supernatant using
a Multisource RNA Miniprep Kit (AP-MN-MS-RNA-250, Axygen) and reverse transcribed to
cDNAs using an iScript cDNA Synthesis Kit (1708890, Bio-Rad). Viral genomes were
quantified by qPCR using iTaq Universal SYBR Green Supermix (1725121, Bio-Rad). RTqPCR was performed on a Bio-Rad CFX-96 Touch Real-Time Detection System. Primer
sequences are shown in Supplementary Table 1.

Lipase activity assay.
The lipase activity of CbAE-1, CbAE-2 and CbAE-1-S187G was measured with a plate assay
as previously described (Liu et al., 1996). Briefly, 20 µg of CbAE-1, CbAE-2 or CbAE-1S187G was spot inoculated onto a 2% agar plate with 1% egg yolk and incubated for 24 hr at
37°C. Phospholipase activity was indicated by the diameter of the lytic halo around each well.

Viral RNA exposure assay.
DENV (1×104 pfu) or ZIKV (1×104 pfu) was incubated with different concentrations of the

CbAEs or PBS in a total volume of 1 ml for 1 hr at 37°C. Then, the mixtures were treated with
1 µl of RNase A (GE101-01, Transgen) and incubated for 1 hr at 37°C. Viral RNA was extracted,
and RNA degradation was evaluated by RT-qPCR as mentioned above.

Transmission electron microscopy.
ZIKV viral particles were purified as described previously (Tan and Lok, 2014). Briefly, virus
stocks were pelleted in 8% w/v PEG 8000 at 10,000 ×g for 1 hr, then purified by 24% w/v
sucrose cushion for 2 hr at 175, 000 ×g (Beckman SW41 Ti rotor) and separated in potassium
tartrate-glycerol gradient 10–35% for 2 hrs at 175,000 ×g (Beckman SW41 Ti rotor). Purified
viral particles were suspended in 10 µg/ml BSA solution or 10 µg/ml CbAE-1 solution and
incubated for 1 hr at room temperature. The samples were then applied to a carbon grid, washed
3 times with water and negatively stained with 1% w/v uranyl acetate. The images were
acquired in a Hitachi H-7650B TEM microscope at 80.0 kV.

RT-qPCR-based neutralization assay.
The in vitro antiviral efficacy of the CbAEs on IAV was tested in A549 cells. Briefly, A549
cells were seeded into a 24-well plate and incubated at 37°C for 20-24 h. IAV (100 TCID50)
were incubated untreated or with a serial dilution of the CbAEs in five-fold steps at 37°C for 1
hr before being added onto A549 cell monolayers to allow infection to proceed for 2 hr. Then,
the virus-protein mixture was removed, and the cells were further cultured with fresh VP-SFM
medium. At 24 hr p.i., relative viral RNA copy numbers in the infected cells were quantified
by RT-qPCR assays with specific primers. The neutralization titre was defined as the
concentration of each protein necessary to inhibit the PCR signal by 90% (i.e., below the
threshold of 10% of the mean value observed in virus control wells).

HIV-1 and SARS-CoV-2 pseudovirus production and neutralization assay.
HIV-1 pseudoviruses were generated by co-transfecting HEK-293T cells with Env expression
vectors and the pNL4-3R-Eluciferase viral backbone plasmid, and a neutralization assay was
performed as described previously (Zhou et al., 2019). Briefly, pseudovirus titres were
measured by luciferase activity in relative light units (RLUs) (Bright-Glo Luciferase Assay

System, Promega Biosciences, California, USA). Neutralization assays were performed by
adding 100 TCID50 (median tissue culture infectious dose) of pseudovirus into 10 serial 1:3
dilutions of CbAE-1 or CbAE-2 starting from 50 µg/ml, following incubation at 37°C for 1 hr
and addition of GhostX4/R5 cells. Neutralizing activity was measured by the reduction in
luciferase activity compared to that in the controls. The fifty percent inhibitory concentration
(IC50) was calculated using the dose-response-inhibition model with the 5-parameter Hill slope
equation in GraphPad Prism 8.0 (GraphPad Software, USA). Vesicular stomatitis virus G
protein (VSV-G) pseudotyped lentiviruses expressing human ACE2 were produced by transient
co-transfection of pMD2G (Addgene #12259) and psPAX2 (Addgene #12260) plasmids and
the transfer vector pLVX-ACE2Flag-IRES-Puro with VigoFect DNA transfection reagent
(Vigorous) into HEK-293T cells to generate the HEK-293T-ACE2 cells for SARS-CoV-2
pseudovirus infection. SARS-CoV-2 pseudoviruses were purchased from GenScript, and
neutralization activity was measured using the HEK-293T-ACE2 cell line with the same
procedures as mentioned above.

Membrane blood feeding.
Fresh human blood from healthy donors was placed in heparin-coated tubes (367884, BD
Vacutainer) and centrifuged at 1,000 ×g and 4°C for 10 min to separate plasma from blood cells.
The plasma was heat-inactivated at 55°C for 60 min. The separated blood cells were washed
three times with PBS to remove the anticoagulant. The blood cells were then resuspended in
heat-inactivated plasma. Bacterial suspension (0.6 OD) was mixed with viruses and treated
blood for mosquito oral feeding via a Hemotek system (6W1, Hemotek). Fully engorged female
mosquitoes were transferred into new containers and maintained under standard conditions for
an additional 8 days. The mosquitoes were subsequently euthanized for further analysis. The
mosquitoes used in this experiment were previously antibiotic treated. Briefly, mosquitoes were
provided with cotton balls moistened with a 10% sucrose solution including 20 units of
penicillin and 20 mg of streptomycin per ml (15070-063, Thermo Fisher Scientific) for 5 days
to remove gut bacteria. The mosquitoes were starved for 24 hr to allow the antibiotics to be
metabolized prior to in vitro membrane blood feeding. Removal of gut bacteria was confirmed
by a colony-forming unit assay.

Cytotoxicity assay.
The cytotoxicity of the CbAEs was evaluated in Vero cells and A549 cells. Cell viability was
measured by the MTT [3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyl tetrazolium bromide]
(M8180, Solarbio) method. Confluent cell monolayers contained in 48-well plates were
exposed to different concentrations of the CbAEs for 24 hr at 37°C. Then, a final concentration
of 0.5 mg/ml MTT was added to each well. After 4 hr of incubation at 37°C, the supernatant
was removed, and 250 µl of dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) was added to each well to solubilize
the formazan crystals. After shaking for 10 min, absorbance was measured at 490 nm. The
concentration of each protein necessary to reduce cell viability by 50% (CC50) was calculated
by comparison with the untreated cells using a sigmoidal nonlinear regression function to fit
the dose-response curve in GraphPad Prism 8.0 (GraphPad Software, USA).

Toxicity study in ICR mice.
ICR mice were used to test the in vivo safety of the CbAEs. A number of 108 ICR 8-week old
female mice were divided into 27 groups (n=4) at random. CbAE-1 or CbAE-2 was dissolved
in PBS and administered either intravenously once at doses of 64, 320, 1600, 4000 and 8000
µg/kg or intranasally once at doses of 64, 320, 1600 and 8000 µg/kg. PBS and corresponding
concentrations of BSA served as negative controls. The general behaviour, signs of toxicity,
body weights and mortality of the mice were recorded after the administration of the CbAEs.
The half-lethal dose (LD50) was calculated using a sigmoidal nonlinear regression function to
fit the dose-response curve in GraphPad Prism 8.0 (GraphPad Software, USA).

Quantification and Statistical Analysis.
Animals were randomly allocated into different groups. Mosquitoes that died before sample
collection were excluded from the analysis. The investigators were not blinded to the allocation
during the experiments or to the outcome assessment. No statistical methods were used to
predetermine the sample size. Descriptive statistics are provided in the figure legends. All
analyses were performed using GraphPad Prism statistical software.
