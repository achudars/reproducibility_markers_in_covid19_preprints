Abstract

2

SARS-CoV-2 has rapidly transmitted worldwide and results in the COVID-19

3

pandemic. Spike glycoprotein on surface is a key factor of viral transmission, and

4

has appeared a lot of variants due to gene mutations, which may influence the

5

viral antigenicity and vaccine efficacy. Here, we used bioinformatic tools to

6

analyze B-cell epitopes of prototype S protein and its 9 common variants.

7

12 potential linear and 53 discontinuous epitopes of B-cells were predicted from

8

the S protein prototype. Importantly, by comparing the epitope alterations

9

between prototype and variants, we demonstrate that B-cell epitopes and

10

antigenicity of 9 variants appear significantly different alterations. The dominant

D614G variant impacts the potential epitope least, only with moderately elevated

12

antigenicity, while the epitopes and antigenicity of some mutants(V483A, V367F,

13

etc.) with small incidence in the population change greatly. These results suggest

14

that the currently developed vaccines should be valid for a majority of

15

SARS-CoV-2 infectors. This study provides a scientific basis for large-scale

16

application of SARS-CoV-2 vaccines and for taking precautions against the

17

probable appearance of antigen escape induced by genetic variation after

18

vaccination.

Author Summary

24

The global pandemic of SARS-CoV-2 has lasted for more than half a year and has

25

not yet been contained. Until now there is no effective treatment for SARS-CoV-2

26

caused disease (COVID-19 ). Successful vaccine development seems to be the only

27

hope. However, this novel coronavirus belongs to the RNA virus, there is a high

28

mutation rate in the genome, and these mutations often locate on the Spike proteins of

29

virus, the gripper of the virus entering the cells. Vaccination induce the generation of

30

antibodies, which block Spike protein. However, the Spike protein variants may

31

change the recognition and binding of antibodies and make the vaccine ineffective. In

32

this study, we predict neutralizing antibody recognition sites (B cell epitopes) of the

prototype S protein of SARS-COV2, along with several common variants using

34

bioinformatics tools. We discovered the variability in antigenicity among the mutants,

35

for instance, in the more widespread D614G variant the change of epitope was least

36

affected, only with slight increase of antigenicity. However, the antigenic epitopes of

37

some mutants change greatly. These results could be of potential importance for future

38

vaccine design and application against SARS-CoV2 variants.

Introduction

41

A severe contagious pneumonia caused by a novel coronavirus was first reported

42

outbreaking at Wuhan of China in December 31, 2019 and soon detected in other

43

countries during few months [1]. This disease was formally named as coronavirus

44

disease 2019 (COVID-19) by World Health Organization (WHO). The genome

45

sequence of the pathogen was soon identified by NGS (accession number:

46

QHO62107.1 from NCBI database) to be a novel beta coronavirus, belonging to the

47

family coronaviradae. As its genome and pathology of the disease is similar to severe

48

acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) breaking out in 2009 [2], this

49

virus was named as SARS-CoV-2. In view of the phylogenetic analysis [1],

50

SARS-CoV-2 shares 79.6% sequence identity with SARS-CoV [3] and 50% with

51

Middle-East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) [4]. Although similar in

52

genome, SARS-CoV-2 is far more contagious, much faster spreading and more

53

destructive than other types of coronavirus: SARS-CoV [5] and (MERS-CoV) [6].

54

Since January 30, 2020, the WHO announced the CoVID-19 contagion as a public

55

health emergency of global concern. As of July 20, 14348858 cases of COVID-19 and

56

603691 deaths have been reported globally according to COVID-19 Situation Report–182

57

(WHO website at https://www.who.int/emergencies/diseases/ novel-coronavirus-2019).

58

The virion of SARS-CoV-2 is spherical, enveloped, and 60-140 nm in diameter

59

with spikes of about 9-12 nm outside. The coronaviral genome encodes 10 proteins,

60

four of them are major structural proteins: the spike (S), membrane (M), envelope (E)

61

and nucleocapsid (N) proteins [7]. Each of these proteins is responsible for different

62

functions in the life cycle of the virus: M protein decides the shape and pattern of the

63

virus envelope. The viral assembly and germination was accomplished by E protein. N

64

proteins and RNA genome of virion are closely linked and participates in viral

65

replication and assembly. Most importantly, the S protein is like a bridge to attach and

66

bind to the host cell receptors, and results in the fusion of the viral and host cellular

67

membranes and consequential viral entry into host cell [7]. The S protein, a I-type

68

transmembrane glycoprotein, compose of ectodomain，transmembrane domain (TM)

69

and CT domain. The ectodomain is made up of two subunits (S1 and S2): the S1

70

subunit includes N-terminal domain (NTD) and receptor-binding domain (RBD), and

71

S2 subunit contains fusion peptide (FP), heptad repeat (HR) domain 1 and 2. The RBD

72

domain is responsible for binding to the receptor of host cells angiotensin-converting

73

enzyme 2 (ACE2), while S2 subunit completes the mission of viral fusion and entry [8].

74

Previous studies on SARS-CoV had shown that RBD was major targets of effective

75

neutralizing antibodies. Therefore, S protein not only is a trigger of virus replication

76

and transmission, but also is the key target of the SARS-CoV-2 vaccine for prevention

77

of Covid-2019 .

78

However, owing to the extensive transmission of SARS-CoV-2, the genetic

79

variants of the virus have appeared in a growing number of countries. 5775 mutations

80

in the SARS-CoV-2 genome were discovered from 10022 public genome data

81

assemblies as at May 1, 2020 [9], in which 394 missense mutations of S protein were

82

detected. Among these spike mutations, D614G mutation, in which Aspartic acid (D)

83

was replaced with Glycine (G) at the AA site of 614, was a major mutation of great

84

concern [10, 11]. SARS-CoV-2 with D614G mutation may have triggered fatal

85

infections in many European countries, such as Spain, Italy, France, etc. [11].

86

These mutations will undoubtedly cause changes in the structure of S proteins.

87

However, it’s highly worth concerning whether or not these mutations affect the

88

antigenicity of S proteins and the binding ability with neutralizing antibodies. If the

89

B-cell epitopes on S protein changed and could not bind the neutralizing antibodies , it

90

would result in losing efficacy of the developed vaccines based on prototype S protein.

91

Many immuno-bioinformatic tools have been developed to dope out the overall

92

and deep analysis of viral antigens, including both linear and discontinuous epitopes of

93

B-cells as well as their immunogenicity, etc. To explore these questions, here we report

94

to used these immuno-bioinformatic tools from the IEDB and related resources to

95

predict the B cell epitopes of S protein from the prototype and mutated strains of

96

SARS-CoV-2 and compare the changes of the likely epitope sites from dominant and

97

rare mutations of S protein. We found that the distinctive mutations of S proteins could

98

impact potential effective epitopes of S proteins in different degree.

Results

101

Epidemiology statistics of S protein mutations

102

We first searched and compared the epidemiology statistic data of S protein mutations

103

published by Korber B and Takahiko Koyama. Korber B et al collected 4,535 genome

104

sequences as of April 13th; Koyama et al identified 5775 distinct genome variants from

105

10 022 SARS CoV-2 genomes, which submitted into database before May 1, 2020 [12].

106

In the Koyama’s report, S protein contained 394 missense mutations [9]. In both

107

reports, the mutation D614G was of the highest frequency and other mutations were

108

relatively rare. Through quantitative statistics of major variants at two time points, we

109

found that in just two weeks, the number of D614G mutation was doubled, which

110

demonstrated that this variant was dominant form among S protein mutations. The

111

frequency of other mutations changed slightly, and some showed zero growth (Table

112

1).

115

Conservation analysis of the prototype S protein
We chose the earliest submitted strain (NCBI ID:QHO62107.1) detected at China as

116

prototype of S protein. Before predicting the B-cell epitopes, we carried out the

117

conservation analysis by comparing this sequence with other earlier sequence

118

submitted from different countries at January-February, 2020. Sequence of

119

SARS-CoV2 S protein from 10 different countries isolates including China (NCBI

120

ID:QHO62107.1), Japan (BBW89517.1), USA (QHQ82464.1), Germany

121

(QKM76570.1), Egypt (QKS66892.1), Spain (QKJ68388.1), France (QJT72638.1) ,

122

Greece (QIZ16535.1), Australian (QHR84449.1) and Russia (QKV28206.1) were

123

subjected to multiple sequence-alignment through Clustal Omega tool (Figure S1).

124

Conservation analysis of S protein sequence manifests that the prototype have 100%

125

identity with all the retrieved sequences. Thus, we used the earliest version of S protein

126

sequence as prototype for following studies of B-cell epitope prediction.

127
128

Structural analysis of prototype S protein

129

To localize these mutations in the position of different functional domains of S

130

protein, we analyzed S protein sequence by bioinformatics tools. First to analyze the

131

trans-membrane protein topology, we applied the online tool TMHMM to treat the

132

sequence of S protein, and localized one transmembrane region. The spatial

133

distribution of residues could be divided into three parts: residues from 1 to 1213 on

134

the extracellular surface, residues from 1214 to 1236 in the region of transmembrane

135

(TM) and residues from 1237 to 1273 in the cytoplasmic region (CT).

136

The exracellular domains divide into S1 and S2 subunits; S1 contains the N-terminal

137

domain (NTD) and receptor binding domain (RBD) [13]. Based on the beginning and

138

end position of different domains, 10 major mutations were shown in the schematic

139

diagram of S protein (Figure 1A). We found that most of S protein mutations (70%)

140

locates in S1 and near region of S protein. The highest mutation D614G is near RBD

141

domain.

142

To show the functional domains at a 3D level and analyze disc-continuous epitopes of

143

S protein, we search database through homology modeling of swiss-model tool, and

144

found out the 3D structure file of S protein PDB ID : 6vyb, in which the amino acid

145

sequences were 99.5% consistent with spike glycoprotein. SARS-CoV-2 spike protein

146

is a trimer, and the 3D structure of ectodomain (open state) from 6vyb is shown in

147

Figure 1B [14] , which contains three chains of A/B/C.

149

Prediction of B-cell epitopes on prototype S protein

150

Humoral immunity play a very important role in defense of viral infection. The B cell

151

receptor (BCR) or neutralizing antibodies recognize B cell epitopes (linear and

152

discontinuous) of S protein, which generally exist on the virus surface as natural

153

antigen molecules without processing.

154

To predict the potential linear B-cell epitopes, we first used BepiPred-2.0

155

prediction tool on IEDB server to screen the prototype S protein sequence and

156

discovered total 30 B-cell linear epitopes (Table S2), whose distribution is shown on

157

Figure 2A. Most of the B-cell epitopes are located on the NTD and RBD domains of S

158

protein. Next, we determined the effective epitopes by analyzing the antigenicity with

159

Vaxijen 2.0 tool and accessibility with Emini Surface Accessibility Prediction tool

160

(Figure 2B ). Totally, 12 effective epitopes were found from 30 predicted epitopes. The

161

position, sequence, length and evaluation scores of potential B-cell linear epitopes are

162

listed in Table 2. Among them, 9 epitopes are in S1 subunit 4 in the NTD region, 5 in

163

the RBD domain) and 3 in the S2 subunit of S protein. Based on this analysis, we

164

found that three epitopes in the RBD domain (384PTKLNDL390,

and 487NCYFPL492) have more significant antigenicity and

167

We further predicted the discontinuous epitopes by the Discotope 2.0 online

168

server. 3D structure of S protein (PDB ID: 6vyb, Chain ID: A) was utilized to predict

169

the discontinuous epitopes. The default threshold was −3.7 with 47% of Sensitivity and

170

75% of Specificity. The 53 discontinuous epitopes were predicted and mainly located

171

in the whole RBD region at 400aa~600aa of S protein shown in Figure 3A. All of the

172

predicted epitopes distributing on surface of S protein are shown in a 3D structure

173

picture in Figure 3B using JSmol Viewer. According to the distribution in different

174

domains, these epitopes (Table S3) could be divided into four groups (Table 3) and the

175

highest propensity score (P-Score) and DiscoTope score (D-Score) of epitopes were

176

concentrated at 498~500aa of RBD region shown by arrows in the Figure 3B.

177

Finally, these epitopes were validated by Pepitope tool (http://pepitope.tau.ac.il/) ,

178

the three major antigen clusters were consistent with B-linear epitopes mentioned

179

above (Table 4), which further indicated the rationality of our predicted B-linear

180

epitopes.

183

Prediction of B-cell epitopes of major variant S protein
The mutations of S protein may influence its structure and change B-cell epitopes

184

for the neutralizing antibody. The missense mutations will result in changes of amino

185

acid residues and may affect B cell epitopes. To assess the impact of the dominant and

186

rare mutations of S-protein to linear B-cell epitopes, we selected those S protein

187

mutations more than 10 counts from these 394 missense mutations to predict B-cell

188

epitopes. Among the several common mutations, we focus the analysis of B-cell

189

epitopes on the ectodomains of S protein, except the L5F mutation in the signal peptide

190

and P1263L mutation in the intracellular region, which are impossible to appear on the

191

surface of the virus. Due to lack of 3D structure data of mutated S proteins, we could

192

not predicted their discontinuous epitopes of B-cells. Through analyzing the sites of 9

193

missense mutation, we found that these conformational epitopes do not contain any

194

sites of common mutations, which can be inferred that the mutation of S protein has a

195

slight effect on the conformational epitope of B cells.Thus, we predicted the linear B

196

cell epitope of 9 variants as described in following and further determined the changes

197

of epitopes by comparison with the epitopes from the prototype S protein.

198
199

H49Y mutation

200

H49Y mutation occurred mainly in China, but seem to be reducing in overall

201

frequency at the present stage [12]. By assessment for its antigenicity and surface

202

availability, we found that four epitopes have changed (Table S4). In brief, after H49Y

203

mutation, the S protein had 14 effective epitopes, two of which have better antigenicity

204

than original epitopes at site of 405~417 and 697~709 , two of which were newly

205

generated at sites of 519~533 and 618~629, and the remaining 10 epitopes were the

206

same as those without mutation.

Y145H mutation

209

Y145H mutation occurred in 8 countries, but the frequency appeared to decrease now

210

[12]. By using the screening methods above, we found that five altering sites have

211

distinct influences on the likely epitopes (Table S5). Y145H mutation emerging, the S

212

protein had 13 effective epitopes, two of which were newly produced from originally

213

unlikely epitopes at sites of 618~625, three of which have better antigenicity than

214

original epitopes at site of 140~153, 459~465 and 657~663, and the remaining 9

215

epitopes were conservative.

216
217
218

V367F mutation
V367F mutation existed in Europe and Hong Kong and appeared to be declining in

219

overall global distribution [12]. Only 6 alterations had obvious effects on likely

220

epitopes (Table S6): two previously effective epitopes (208~220 and 487~492) were

221

out of work in replacement for 210~221 and 487~489, one epitope was deleted at site

222

of 459~464, two alterations (141~152→140~154 and 208~220→210~221) greatly

223

reduced the antigenicity of the original epitopes. However, the antigenicity of two

224

previous epitopes (385~392 and 404~416) were enhanced. It's also worth noting that

225

there were 9 potential epitopes after V367F mutation, in which the overall

226

immunogenicity was reduced.

227
228

G476S

229

Via the mentioned predicting tool before, there are 9 changes that directly affected the

230

effective epitope as follows (Table S7): (1) The previously likely epitopes at site of

231

62~75 and 459~464 were deleted. (2) The antigenicity of epitope at site of 216~221

232

was decreased below the threshold which cannot be an effective epitope. (3) The

233

antigenicity of formerly ineffective epitope was elevated to be a effective epitope at

234

site of 314~321. (4) Two epitopes (372~374+384~390) fused into a new epitope

235

(368~390), but its antigenicity was lower than the epitope before. (5) Three alterations

236

of epitopes improved their antigenicity with site 406~417,440~450 and 657~663. (6)

237

The epitope at site 486~492 was reduced antigenicity slightly. Therefore, 9 effective

238

epitopes have predicted after G476S mutation, in which the amount of

239

epitope-changing is the most, and the overall antigenicity was dereased.

240
241

V483A mutation

242

Through the above methods for analysis, we found that 13 changes influenced

243

significantly on B-cell potential epitope of V483A variant (Table S8). These major

244

changes can be grouped into four categories: (1) Deletion: the site of 62~75 and

245

487~492. The antigenicity of epitope (210~221) was too low to be a suitable epitope.

246

(2) Additional epitopes: the antigenicity of epitopes at 181~186,342~353,363~377and

247

617~628 were upregulated above threshold to become new epitopes. (3) Reduced

248

antigenicity: the antigenicity of original epitope (405~418) was decreased generally at

249

site of 405~413. (4) Improved antigenicity: four epitopes of 379~389, 442~447,

250

458~463, and 698~709 elevated their antigenicity. Therefore, there were 13 effective

251

epitopes in total, and the overall antigenicity after mutation was advanced compared

252

with prototype spike protein.

254

D614G mutation

255

D614G mutation was of higher frequency in global area (6294/10022 samples). The

256

SARS-CoV2 strains with G614 form was more transmissible. Once it entered the new

257

area, it could rapidly become the dominant infection form according to the

258

epidemiological analyze [12]. Therefore, we paid a great attention to analyze the

259

immunological characteristics of this mutation. We found total 29 B-cell linear

260

epitopes. Among them, 12 effective epitopes were predicted. Surprisingly, only one

261

epitope changed slightly when comparing with prototype S protein. The B-cell epitope

262

657-664 of prototype shorten one AA in D614G. This changed epitope 657-663 is with

263

a slight increase in accessibility and antigenicity by 36.8% and 25.6%, suggesting that

264

G614 mutant is more likely to bind to neutralizing antibodies and the binding efficacy

265

is also increased compared with D614 stain. The remaining epitopes were consistent

266

with the non-mutated S protein (Table S9). Importantly, three epitopes in the RBD

267

domain (384PTKLNDL390, 405DEVRQIAPGQTGKI418, and 487NCYFPL492) are

268

identical between D614 and G614 forms.

269
270

V615I mutation

271

After V615I mutation of S protein, only one change affected the potential epitope at

272

site of 657~663 with slight increase of antigenicity (Table S10), the rest of 11 as same

273

as prototype. Finally, 12 potent epitopes were predicted similarly to D614G variant.

276

V615F mutation
The background of V615F mutation is consistent with V615I. Through the

277

above-mentioned forecasting tool, we found that 12 alterations directly affected B cell

278

epitope other than V615I mutation obviously (Table S11). Specifically, the antigenicity

279

of the four epitopes decreased at site of 140~154,209~212,441~444 and 487~497,in

280

which the antigenicity of 209~212 and 441~444 were too low to effect . The original

281

likely epitope of 384~390 was deleted. However, the antigenicity of four epitopes

282

improved at site of 404~418,458~466, 656~664 and 697~709. There are three

283

neoantigen epitopes at site 180~186,214~221 and 374~389 with strong antigenicity.

284

Ultimately, 12 potent epitopes were predicted.

285
286

A831V mutation

287

Although A831V mutation is emerging only in Iceland as a single lineage up to now, it

288

is found a potential fusion peptide in S2 [12],which directly affect the pathogenicity of

289

SARS-CoV-2.After A831V mutation of S protein, 5 potential epitopes have altered

290

(Table S12), but the remaining epitopes were consistent with those prototype. Only the

291

antigenicity of epitope at site of 141~153 was reduced, while other 4 epitopes greatly

292

improved their antigenicity at site 405~417, 459~465 618~625 and 657~663, in which

293

the site (618~625) became new effective epitopes, as antigenicity increases beyond the

294

threshold. Therefore, the S protein with A831V mutation had 13 potential epitopes,

295

with increasing antigenicity.

Comparison of the changes on epitopes of variants
In order to investigate the influences of the above common 9 mutations of

299

S protein on B cell epitopes, we compared the predicted epitopes of reference and

300

mutant S protein, analyzed the association of epitope changes among mutations and

301

determined the influence of mutation on B cell epitopes. The detailed information of

302

changes in each mutation is listed in the Table S13. We found that some mutations did

303

not or slightly change B-cell epitopes, while others strongly impact the number and site

304

of B-cell epitopes. All the major changes of B-cells comparison was summarized in

305

Table 5. Most important finding is that the commonest mutation D614G change the

306

B-cell epitopes of S protein slightly, only moderately increasing the accessibility and

307

antigenicity of epitope 657-663. There are 12 potential epitopes in D614G

308

mutation, nearly identical to those without mutation. In D614G and V615I

309

mutation, their effective epitopes were also 12, in which only 1 epitope at the same site

310

of 657~663 could affect the potential effective epitopes with slight increase of

311

antigenicity. However, the amounts and forms of changes in epitopes were abundant in

312

V483A, V615F, V367F and G476S mutations. Among them, the alterations of epitopes

313

in V483A are the most significant, 13 changes were present and 13

314

epitopes predicted, and the antigenicity was highly improved. Changes in V615F

315

followed by, 11 effective epitopes and 12 changes were discovered with reduced

316

antigenicity as a whole. In addition, the change sites of some epitopes are common to

317

several mutants. The change in epitopes 459~464 occurred in many mutations: Y145H,

318

V367F, G476S, V483A, V615F and A831V. The epitope of 657~663 alters in Y145H,

319

G476S, D614G, V615I, V615F and A831V. The epitope at 1154~1169 doesn’t change

320

among 9 mutations.

323

Discussion
As we know , a majority of COVID-19 vaccines at the present stage were designed

324

to target S proteins in order to induce the neutralizing antibody [15, 16], and most

325

vaccines entering phase 3 clinical trials are based on the early S protein [17, 18].

326

However, the massive replication and rapid global transmission of SARS-CoV-2

327

provide the virus with sufficient opportunity to mutate and evolve.

328

By searching the literature and database of SARS-CoV-2, we found 11 common

329

mutations of S protein shown in Table 1, and 5 of them are concentrated on and near

330

RBD domain. Especially, the most frequently occurring mutation D614G located at S1

331

and S2 junctions, where is near the furin cleavage site of the S1/S2 boundary. Walls

332

reported that deletion of this cleavage region could influence SARS-CoV-2 S-mediated

333

entry into host cells [8]. Hence, Korber [12] and Zhang [19] proposed that D614G

334

mutation contributes to the spread of SARS-CoV-2, which makes G614 strain swiftly

335

become the dominant mutant.

336

The mutation in S protein may affect the B–cell epitopes and lead to vaccine

337

failure. Therefore, in order to explore the impact of mutations on antigenicity of S

338

protein, in this study, we applied immuno-informatics tools to predict potential B-cell

339

epitopes of prototype and variant S protein.

340

The reliably of prediction tools and methods were demonstrated by previous

341

studies, for example, the epitopes prediction of MERS-CoV. Qamar reported that the

342

linear and discontinuous epitopes were successfully predicted with the same

343

immuno-informatics tools as we used here [20]. In other confirmed experiments,

344

hMS-1 mAbs (monoclonal antibody) recognized some discontinuous epitopes

345

predicted from Qamar’s research [21].

346

Our predicted epitopes of prototype S protein also coincide with sites of

347

neutralizing antibodies validated in other group’s experimental studies. Cao et al have

348

firstly shown that 7 mAbs isolated from 60 convalescent patients of COVID-19

349

showed both strong affinity binding to RBD and a potent neutralizing ability against

350

SARS-CoV-2 [22]. They possessed high structural similarity with m396, previously

351

neutralizing antibody of SARS-CoV , which can recognize epitopes (residues 408, 442,

352

443, 460, 475) on the RBD domain of SARS-CoV S protein [23]. Since RBD region of

353

S protein is more prone to neutralizing antibodies [24], we checked epitopes in this

354

318~550 RBD region. The validations of these experiments above are consistent with

355

our predicted B cell epitopes as follows: 5 potential linear epitopes as 384~390,

356

405~418, 441~448, 459~464 and 487~492 (Table 2) and discontinuous epitopes such

357

as No.2 (Table 3) could be vaccine candidates targets.

358

Importantly, it’s worth exploring whether or not the mutations on S protein leads

359

to epitope changes. Therefore, we used a group of prediction tools of B-cell epitopes to

360

predict the prototype and variant S protein.

361

At present, the most notable mutation is D614G , the most popular dominant

362

mutation among genetic variants (6294 D614G in10 022 cases, 63% ) [9]. Fortunately,

363

we demonstrate that S protein with D614G mutation has the least change of the

364

potential effective B-cell epitope, in which only one linear epitope has slight change in

365

the length of non-RBD region, compared with the prototype. The predicted B-cell

366

epitopes on RBD domain are same between D614 and G614 forms. Hence, this result

367

suggests that the effective vaccine based on prototype S protein should protect the

368

infection of both prototype and D614G variant virus, which cover more than 90%

369

cases estimated from data of Koyama’s study[9]. That is to say, the vaccines currently

370

being developed could protect a large proportion of the SARS-CoV-2 infected

371

population, including both the D614 prototype and the dominant G614 variant. Our

372

prediction results are consistent with Weissman et al’s study [25], in which G614

373

Spike pseudovirions were not less susceptible to neutralization, but instead moderately

374

more. This data indicate that D614G mutation do not change the B-cell epitopes to

375

escape the immune recognition.

376

Based on the prediction results, we also found that some mutations significantly

377

change the B-cell epitopes, for example, G476S and V483A, which perhaps impact the

378

effect of SARS-CoV-2 vaccine with prototype S protein. The vaccination of

379

SAES-CoV-2 vaccine may give a selection pressure for these variants.

380

On the other hand, we found that some mutations significantly change the B-cell

381

epitopes. The predicted effective epitopes of D614 form are missing or down-

382

regulated at some mutated S protein, such as V367F, G476S, V483A and V615F.

383

These variants with more changes in potential epitopes may have significant

384

differences in response to vaccines. If responsiveness to vaccines reduced, it will select

385

the SARS-CoV-2 viral strains. However, this low-response epitope accounts for a

386

small proportion of potential epitopes, so the reactive down-regulation of the vaccine is

387

also limited and does not fundamentally alter the efficacy of vaccine. Anyhow, these

388

variants were rare in COVID-19 population. Therefore, the upcoming vaccine may

389

have positive effects on major SARS-CoV-2.

390

In conclusion, by the prediction of B-cell epitopes of the prototype and different

391

mutant S proteins, we demonstrate that some mutations could significantly change

392

B-cell epitopes, but others just slightly. Fortunately, the dominant variant D614G

393

nearly do not change the B-cell epitopes of prototype S protein. This indicates that the

394

vaccine based on prototype S protein could effectively protect human population

395

against most of infection of SARS-CoV-2 viruses. This would be beneficial to the

396

large-scale application of prototype vaccines of SARS-CoV-2, including in high

397

incidence areas rich in mutant strains. We should also be of vigilance that as the

398

application of SARS-CoV-2 vaccine, it would lead to selection pressure for S protein

399

variants that maybe significantly change B-cell epitopes with antigen escape.

400

International society should prepare for this situation after SARS-CoV-2 vaccination in

401

advance.

405

The primary sequence of SARS-CoV-2 S protein was retrieved from NCBI GenBank

406

database using accession number QHO62107.1 and was used as prototype sequence or

407

reference sequence for vaccine development in many projects [14]. Its complete

408

genome number is NC_045512, which. The major variation sequences were available

409

from The Global Initiative for Sharing All Influenza Data (GISAID) [26] and GenBank

410

database. As for epidemiological statistics on the number of mutations, we selected

411

data collected from two time points to observe the change of the amount of mutations.

412

One data set collected until April 13, 2020 was reported by Korber B in a pre-print

413

paper [12], while another until May 1, 2020 was from Takahiko Koyama’s research[9].

414

We performed the secondary classification analysis on the 10 022 sequences listed in

415

the supplement data of Takahiko Koyama’s paper, and obtained the number of

416

different S protein mutations in order to calculate the mutation frequency. We then

417

selected 10 variants with a amount of mutations greater than 10 cases for further

418

analysis.

Conservation analysis of selected S protein sequences

421

S protein sequences from 10 different countries were randomly achieved from an open

422

423

MSAViewer tool from VIPR database (https://www. viprbrc.org)，multiple sequence

429

Structural and antigenicity analysis

430

First, we analyzed the secondary structure of S protein of SARS-CoV-2. The

431

Conserved Domain Database (CDD) tool [29] in the NCBI website was used to

432

analyze the main functional domains of S proteins and to determine the detail

433

functional domains of S proteins with reference of Jun Lan’s study [13]. An TMHMM

434

online tool (http://www.cbs.dtu.dk/ services/TMHMM/) was used to examine the

435

transmembrane topology of S protein [30]. The homologous modeling of S protein was

436

carried out by using Swiss-model tool (https://swissmodel.expasy.org) to find its

437

3D-structure data. The confirmed 3D structure of SARS-CoV-2 S protein via electron

438

microscopy 3.2 Å was acquired by using PDB ID: 6VYB from Protein-Data-Bank [8].

439

The antigenicity of S proteins was predicted by Vaxijen 2.0 in the default threshold of

440

0.4. This tool was developed to define antigens classification in view of the

441

physicochemical properties of proteins rather than sequence alignment, and now is a

442

common antigenicity assessment tool for vaccine design and available from internet

443

(http://www.ddg-pharmfac.net/vaxijen/ VaxiJen/VaxiJen.html) [31, 32].

B-cell epitope prediction of S protein

446

We used the sequence from early onset SARS-CoV-2 as the wildtype or prototype and

447

the recent variant virus as mutation strains to predict the B-cell epitopes of S protein.

448

The S protein sequence was exclusive of the signal peptide (SP), TM and cytoplasmic

449

region, and only the ectodomain of S protein was used for analysis. The linear and

450

non-linear (discontinuous) epitopes of B cell were predicted by the different tools.

451

The linear epitopes were prediced by BepiPred-2.0 server of IEDB online database [33,

452

34]. The threshold was set to 0.55, which represented that the sensitivity was 29%, and

453

the specificity was 81%. Analysis result shows in a figure in which the residues with

454

scores above the threshold predicted to be part of an epitope were colored in yellow.

455

The effective B-cell epitopes relies on stronger antigenicity and accessibility of surface

456

[35] . Then the better epitopes were evaluated by Vaxijen 2.0 for total antigenicity

457

scores and Emini surface accessibility prediction tool for accessibility scores [36].

458

The prediction of discontinuous epitopes depended on surface accessibility and amino

459

acid statistics and X-ray crystallography of protein epitopes [37]. We predicted the

460

discontinuous epitopes of prototype S protein via DiscoTope 2.0 server [38] by

461

entering PDB ID number: 6VYB. The threshold was determined at 0.5, which

462

manifested 23% sensitivity and 90% specificity.

463
464

Comparison of B-cell epitopes between the prototype and mutated S protein

465

According to the research of Korber B, et al. [12] and Takahiko Koyama [9]，we

466

selected 9 variants of the mutated S proteins for analysis of their B cell epitopes and

467

compared each of them with epitopes from prototype sequence to determine the

468

influence of mutation on epitopes. Finally，we summarized and listed all of major

469

changes in a table.
