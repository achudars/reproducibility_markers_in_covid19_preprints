Abstract
The recently emerged pathogenic severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2
(SARS-CoV-2) has spread rapidly, leading to a global COVID-19 pandemic. Binding
of the viral spike protein (SARS-2-S) to cell surface receptor angiotensin-converting
enzyme 2 (ACE2) mediates host cell infection. In the present study, we demonstrate
that in addition to ACE2, the S1 subunit of SARS-2-S binds to HDL and that
SARS-CoV-2 hijacks the SR-B1-mediated HDL uptake pathway to facilitate its entry.
SR-B1 facilitates SARS-CoV-2 entry into permissive cells by augmenting virus
attachment. MAb (monoclonal antibody)-mediated blocking of SARS-2-S-HDL
binding and SR-B1 antagonists strongly inhibit HDL-enhanced SARS-CoV-2
infection. Notably, SR-B1 is co-expressed with ACE2 in human pulmonary and
extrapulmonary tissues. These findings revealed a novel mechanism for SARS-CoV-2
entry and could provide a new target to treat SARS-CoV-2 infection.

Introduction
Since the outbreak of COVID-19 caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome
coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), over half million people have died and the total number
of global confirmed cases was now over 10 million as of July 28, 20201. Coronavirus
tropism is predominantly determined by the interaction between coronavirus spikes (S)
and their corresponding host receptors2,3. The S protein of SARS-CoV-2 (SARS-2-S)
can be cleaved into the S1 (SARS-2-S1) and S2 (SARS-2-S2) subunits, which are
responsible for receptor recognition and membrane fusion4. Binding of SARS-CoV-2
to ACE2 occurs via the C-terminal domain (also called receptor binding domain
[RBD]) of SARS-2-S15. The observed incomplete inhibition of ACE2 antibody and
the high neutralization potency of mAb (monoclonal antibody) targeting the
N-terminal domain (NTD) of SARS-2-S1 suggest that SARS-CoV-2 might may use
other (co)receptors, or auxiliary proteins or even other mechanisms for host cell
entry6.
Scavenger receptor B type 1 (SR-B1) is a cell surface HDL receptor that mediates the
selective uptake of HDL-CE (cholesteryl esters) and other lipid components of
receptor-bound HDL particles, including free cholesterol (FC), triglycerides (TGs),
phospholipids (PLs), α-tocopherol and vitamin E7. This cholesterol delivery system is
well operated in isolated hepatocytes, fibroblasts, adipocytes, macrophages, adrenal,
ovarian and testicular Leydig cells8. Interestingly, alveolar type II cells also express
SR-B1, which is responsible for vitamin E uptake preferentially from HDL9,10. SR-B1

has emerged as a critical receptor that affects HCV entry11. However, the potential
role of SR-B1 in SARS-CoV-2 infection has yet to be evaluated.
Results
Due to the importance of SARS-2-S in mediating the infection of target cells, a search
for cholesterol-regulated motifs in the primary sequence of SARS-2-S was conducted
and 6 putative cholesterol recognition amino acid consensus (CRAC) motifs adjacent
to the inverted cholesterol recognition motif called CARC were identified12 (Fig. 1a).
We then evaluated the ability of SARS-2-S to associate with cholesterol. The purity of
SARS-2-S, SARS-2-S1 and SARS-2-S2 protein was validated by SDS-PAGE
(Extended Data Fig. 1a). MST assay showed that SARS-2-S could bind to cholesterol
with an EC50 of 187.6±120.5 nM (Fig. 1b). Specifically, SARS-2-S did not exhibit
any binding with campesterol and epicholesterol, two structurally distinct sterols with
additional methyl and hydroxyl groups (Fig. 1c). In a competition assay, unlabeled
SARS-2-S protein had an IC50 of 821±69.8 nM for cholesterol (Extended Data Fig.
1b). In subsequent analyses, we evaluated the interaction of SARS-2-S, SARS-2-S1
and SARS-2-S2 with HDL particles. While SARS-2-S and SARS-2-S1 bound to HDL
(Fig.

1d),

SARS-2-S2

failed

to

HDL

(Fig.

1e).

Furthermore,

immunoprecipitation analysis revealed that SARS-2-S1 did not bind to ApoA1
(Extended Data Fig. 1c). Taken together, these results strongly support the notion that
the SARS-2-S has a specific affinity for cholesterol and HDL. We then attempted to
dissect the interacting determinants in SARS-2-S through an in vitro binding assay.
Among the four cholesterol binding peptides encompassing the CARC-CRAC region,

three putative cholesterol recognition regions were observed to reside in the CTD of
SARS-2-S1, while one motif was located in the RBD (Fig. 1f). In consistence with the
MST data, the 2 cholesterol recognition motifs in SARS-2-S2 did not show any
binding affinity with cholesterol (Fig.1f).
We then want to determine whether the association of SARS-2-S1 with HDL affects
SARS-CoV-2 entry. To this end, the capacity of HDL in affecting the entry of
SARS-2-S-pseudovirus (SARS-CoV-2pp) was explored (Fig. 2a). HDL significantly
enhanced SARS-CoV-2pp entry in a dose dependent manner (Fig. 2b), and similar
results were observed in Huh-7 cells infected with authentic SARS-CoV-2 (Fig. 2c).
To investigate the role of HDL in SARS-2-S cell surface attachment, cells were
incubated with SARS-2-S in solutions containing HDL at RT for 30 min and
immunolabeled for SARS-2-S after washing. Quantitative analysis of the expression
rate (Fig. 2d) and mean fluorescent intensity (MFI; Fig. 2e) revealed that HDL
induced a substantial increase in cell surface SARS-2-S attachment in a dose
dependent manner.
In a previous study, the mAb 1D2 was isolated from convalescent COVID-19 patients
and shown to exhibit high neutralization potency against SARS-CoV-26. Lys147,
Lys150 and Tyr145, which are located in the HDL-binding motif of SARS-2-S, were
identified as important antigenic sites for 1D26. We then examined the ability of this
mAb to interfere with HDL binding to SARS-2-S1. Preincubation of 1D2 with
SARS-2-S1 before the addition of HDL completely blocked SARS-2-S1-HDL
binding (Fig. 2f), strongly reduced HDL-enhanced SARS-CoV-2pp entry (Fig. 2g)

and authentic SARS-CoV-2 infection (Fig. 2h). Collectively, these data show that
HDL enhances SARS-CoV-2 infectivity by interacting with the NTD of SARS-2-S1.
As SR-B1 is a cell-surface receptor that binds HDL and plays a central role in HDL
endocytosis and cholesterol efflux, we wondered whether the HDL-mediated
enhancement of SARS-CoV-2 infectivity occurs through SR-B1. To test this
possibility, infection assays were performed using two SARS-CoV-2pp permissive
cell lines, Huh-7 and Vero E6. Huh-7 cells displayed higher surface (Extended Data
Fig.2a) and intracellular (Extended Data Fig.2b) SR-B1 and ACE2 protein levels than
Vero cells. Notably, ectopic SR-B1 overexpression specifically enhanced Huh-7
susceptibility to SARS-CoV-2pp, but not to unrelated VSV-Gpp (Fig. 3a and
Extended Data Fig.2c). In contrast, SR-B1 downregulation significantly reduced
HDL-mediated enhancement of infection (Fig. 3b and Extended Data Fig. 2d). We
next sought to determine whether SR-B1 overexpression renders cells more
susceptible to infection with authentic SARS-CoV-2. The RNA load of SARS-CoV-2
in Huh-7 cells transfected with siSR-B1 (Extended Data Fig. 2e) was approximately
10 times lower than that observed in control cells (Fig. 3c), while SR-B1
overexpression (Extended Data Fig. 2f) in Vero E6 cells potently increased
SARS-CoV-2 infection (Fig. 3d).
To further survey the SARS-CoV-2pp susceptibility, MDCK, 293T and Hepa 1-6 cells
with very low SARS-CoV-2pp susceptibility and nearly undetectable SR-B1 and
ACE2 expression were evaluated (Extended Data Fig. 2a-b). We challenged these
cells with SARS-CoV-2pp after being transfected with cDNA vectors encoding

human ACE2 and/ or SR-B1 (Extended Data Fig. 2g). MDCK (Fig. 3e) and 293T (Fig.
3f) became highly susceptible to SARS-CoV-2pp upon ACE2 expression, while Hepa
1-6 remained less permissive (Fig. 3g). Although SR-B1 introduction did not render
these cells more permissive, the combined SR-B1 and ACE2 expression resulted in
higher susceptibility than that observed with ACE2 or SR-B1 expression alone (Fig.
3e, f, g). In particular, SARS-CoV-2pp infectivity was correlated with only SR-B1
expression levels when ACE2 was overexpressed (Fig. 3h and Extended Data Fig. 2h).
Of note, the expression of SR-B1 with or without ACE2 did not modify the cell
surface expression levels of either of these entry factors at 24 h after transfection
(Extended Data Fig. 2i). Hence, our results indicated that SR-B1 is an entry
coreceptor of SARS-CoV-2.
Further analysis was performed to assess the colocalization of SARS-2-Spp with
SR-B1 via confocal fluorescence microscopy. SARS-CoV-2pp in solutions containing
HDL was incubated with cells on ice for 1 min and subsequently visualized their
binding to GFP-SR-B1 expressed on the cell surface. Immunostaining results revealed
co-localization of SR-B1 with SARS-2-Spp (Fig. 4a). In particular, GFP-SR-B1
positive cells showed increased intensity of intracellular SARS-CoV-2pp staining as
compared to GFP-negative cells when we switched the incubation temperature from
4 °C to 37 °C to allow SARS-CoV-2pp entry (Fig. 4b). In agreement with the above
results, ectopic SR-B1 expression also led to increased SARS-2-S cell-surface binding
stimulated by HDL (Fig. 4c, d). Because SARS-2-S cannot bind to SR-B1 directly
(Fig. 4e), our data indicated that SARS-CoV-2 interacts with SR-B1 bridged by HDL

during virus entry.
The implication of SR-B1 was further validated by testing the effects of known
SR-B1 inhibitors on SARS-CoV-2 infection, including ITX 506113 and block lipid
transport-1 (BLT-1). BLT-1 is a small compound that inhibits the SR-B1-mediated
selective transfer of lipids without affecting HDL-SR-B1 binding14. Both of these
compounds exerted no unwanted cytotoxic effects (Extended Data Fig. 3a, b) and
significantly blocked SARS-2-Spp entry (Extended Data Fig. 3c, d). Importantly, the
HDL-mediated enhancement of SARS-CoV-2pp infectivity was significantly blocked
by ITX 5061 and BLT-1 (Fig. 4f). To obtain direct evidence that clinical-grade ITX
5061 can indeed interfere with SARS-CoV-2 infections, we infected Vero E6 cells
with SARS-CoV-2 in the presence of HDL with or without ITX 5061. Viral RNA was
purified from cells and assayed by qRT-PCR as a marker for replication. Indeed, ITX
5061 treatment strongly inhibited SARS-CoV-2 infection stimulated by HDL (Fig. 4g).
Therefore, SR-B1-mediated HDL uptake facilitates SARS-CoV-2 infection and posit
potential therapeutic strategy.

Interestingly, the co-expression of SR-B1 and ACE2 could also be recognized in

extrapulmonary tissues including colon, retina, small intestine, and testis (Fig. 4h and
Extended Data Fig. 4a). Overall, our data demonstrated that SR-B1 was coexpressed
with ACE2 on multiple susceptible tissues and could potentially be involved during
SARS-CoV-2 infection.
Discussion
With over 10 million infected people, COVID-19 represents a major public health
problem of high socio-economic impact. However, treatment options for COVID-19
are limited, and a vaccine for prevention against COVID-19 infection is currently not
available. The results of our present study demonstrated that SR-B1 is required for
SARS-CoV-2 entry and infection. Indeed, SARS-CoV-2 entry is inhibited by silencing
SR-B1 expression and by SR-B1 antagonists. Moreover, SR-B1 expression levels
have been shown to affect SARS-2-Spp attachment, entry and authentic SARS-CoV-2
infection. Thus, as a key entry factor, SR-B1 offers a novel therapeutic strategy to
prevent or cure SARS-CoV-2 infection.
HDL is one of the major groups of lipoproteins present in human plasma that
nonspecifically blocks or facilitates viral entry through the SR-B1. In the present
study, we observed that the presence of HDL significantly increases authentic
SARS-CoV-2 infection. Mechanistically, HDL facilitates viral attachment and entry
by associating with SARS-2-S. The NTD and RBD domains of SARS-2-S1 are
involved in its interaction with HDL. An antibody blocking SARS-2-S1-HDL binding
was observed to strongly inhibit HDL-enhanced SARS-2-Spp entry. To our surprise,
we did not observe an interaction between SARS-2-RBD and cholesterol (data not

shown). Thus, the key determinants of SARS-2-S1 in mediating HDL interaction and
their implications in viral entry requires further investigation.
As a key entry cofactor, SR-B1 cannot bind to SARS-2-S protein directly. However,
HDL-enhanced SARS-2-S attachment and SARS-CoV-2pp entry were greatly
increased by SR-B1 expression. Importantly, SR-B1 expression conferred the greatest
cell susceptibility to SARS-CoV-2pp only when coexpressed with ACE2. However,
additional cell lines with varying degrees of SR-B1 and ACE2 receptor expression or
primary targeted cells are needed to elucidate the function of SR-B1 in mediating
viral entry. Our present data support the notion that SR-B1 functions as a linker
molecule that recruits viral particles to come into close proximity with ACE2 by
associating with HDL (Extended Data Fig. 5b). A major breakthrough will be the
identification of the SR-B1-ACE2 membrane complex that is important for viral
entry.
If SR-B1 is the primary receptor defining SARS-CoV-2 attachment to target cells,
why does the lipid transfer activity of SR-B1 promotes viral entry? We know that
SR-B1-mediated lipid transfer from HDL results in local increases in the cholesterol
content of cell membranes8,15. Cholesterol and the abundant presence of cholesterol
within lipid rafts play an essential role in viral entry and fusion16-19, and cholesterol
depletion from cellular membranes has been shown to inhibit SARS-CoV-2
infection20. We thus speculated that SARS-CoV-2 may exploit SR-B1 physiological
function to achieve its entry and fusion processes.
The widespread expression of multiple subsets of SR-B1 across diverse tissues may

contribute to the high transmissibility of SARS-CoV-2. To understand how SR-BI and
ACE2 coordinate viral entry, it is important to compare receptor expression pattern(s)
and localization in lower respiratory tissues. In the current study, we demonstrated
that lower respiratory tissues express SR-B1 and ACE2, consistent with their ability to
support SARS-CoV-2 entry. Of note, although ectopic SR-B1 introduction did not
modify ACE2 expression at 24 h after transfection, significantly increased
intracellular and surface ACE2 protein levels were observed at 48 h after SR-B1
transfection (data not shown). It is thus interesting to uncover the spatiotemporal
relationship between SR-B1, lipid raft, and ACE2. Publicly available patient cohorts
indicated that expression of SR-B1 was greater in atherosclerotic arteries than normal
arteries, we have reasons to believe that SR-B1 plays a major role in pathophysiology
of COVID-19, especially in patients with severe acute metabolic disturbance.
ACE2 was identified as a functional SARS coronavirus receptor both in cell lines and
in vivo21. Spike protein–mediated ACE2 downregulation then contributes to the
severity of lung pathologies22. Commonalities between SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV
infection implicate the uses of antibodies, peptides and small compounds targeting
ACE2 in the treatment of SARS-CoV-2. By identification of SR-B1 as a
SARS-CoV-2 entry coreceptor, we expanded upon antiviral therapeutic approaches to
include drugs that target SR-B1. Amazingly, ITX 5601, a clinically approved
promising inhibitor of HCV infection, strongly inhibits SARS-CoV-2 infection in
vitro. In summary, the results of the present study provide key insights into the
remarkable capacity of the SARS-CoV-2 virus to hijack SR-B1 functions to promote

Microscale thermophoresis (MST)
MST assays were conducted as previously described23. SARS-2-S-His-tagged,
SARS-2-S1-His-tagged, and SARS-2-S2-His-tagged proteins were labeled with
NT-647 dye for 30 min at room temperature, as recommended by the Monolith
His-Tag Labeling Kit RED-tris-NTA protocol (NanoTemper Technologies,
MO-L008). The binding buffer used for reactions [50 mM Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 150
mM NaCl, and 1 mM DTT] contained micelles of 0.5% fos-choline 13, and a 16-step,
2-fold dilution curve of cholesterol and cholesterol derivatives ranged from 4 μM to
122 pM. Cholesterol or other sterol dry powders were mixed with binding buffer at
25 °C with mild agitation for 3 h. Labeled protein (100 nM, final concentration) in
binding buffer was then added to a dilution curve of cholesterol or cholesterol
derivatives at room temperature. Samples were loaded into standard glass capillaries
(NanoTemper Technologies, MO-K022). Microscale thermophoresis was completed
in three independent experiments on a Monolith NT.115 instrument (NanoTemper
Technologies) running MO.Control software with settings of 60-80% excitation

power and 40% MST power at room temperature.
In the HDL-binding assay, labeled protein (100 nM, final concentration) in binding
buffer (145 mM NaCl) was added to a dilution curve of HDL at room temperature,
where the dilution curve of HDL ranged from 6.25 μg/mL to 190.7 pg/mL (16-step,
2-fold). Samples were loaded into standard glass capillaries (NanoTemper
Technologies, MO-K022). Microscale thermophoresis was completed in 3
independent repeat experiments on a Monolith NT.115 instrument (NanoTemper
Technologies), running MO.Control software with settings of 60-80% excitation
power and 40% MST power at room temperature.
In the competition assay, 100 nM of labeled SARS-2-S in binding buffer was
incubated with 400 nM cholesterol either alone or with unlabeled SARS-2-S at the
indicated concentrations.
Original data were obtained from MO.Affinity Analysis software. Fluorescence
intensity values were averaged and expressed as the relative change over the results
from the 0 μM ligand condition. The data were to fitted saturation binding equations
using GraphPad Prism 8.0. Dotted lines indicate where data could not be fitted.

The N-term and C-term Lys residues increase the solubility of the hydrophobic
CARC-CRAC transmembrane segment. Replacing the Pro residue located between
the CARC and the CRAC with Trp conferred intrinsic fluorescence upon 280 nm
excitation, with maximum emission at 350 nm. As previously reported, the
conformation of the peptide affects the 350 nm emission intensity, and the
fluorescence titration assay was performed as previously described (6). Stock
solutions of 5 mM peptide in DMSO were diluted to a final concentration of 5 μM in
assay buffer containing 140 mM NaCl and 20 mM Tris (pH 8.5) supplemented with 2
mM TCEP and 2% (v/v) EtOH. Stock solutions of cholesterol in EtOH were diluted
to final concentrations ranging between 0.5 and 50 μM in 500-μL volumes of peptide
solution, which were incubated overnight at 25 °C with mild agitation. Fluorescence
measurements were performed in triplicate on a Cary Eclipse fluorescence
spectrophotometer (Agilent Technologies), with excitation and emission performed at
280 and 350 nm, respectively. All measured fluorescence values fell within the linear
range of the instrument. Fluorescence intensity values were averaged and expressed as
relative change over the 0 μM ligand condition. Data were fitted to saturation binding

Pseudovirus production
All pseudoparticles were generated in 293T cells transfected with the HIV backbone
vector pNL4-3.Luc.R-E together with the expression plasmids SARS-2-S or VSV-G.
Pseudoparticle-containing supernatants were harvested at 48 h and frozen to -80 °C
after centrifugation at 2000×g for 5 min.
Pseudovirus entry assays
Cells were cultured in 96-well transparent-bottom flat culture plates (#3603, Corning)
precoated with poly-D-lysine. To assess the inhibitory activity of chemicals, the
indicated concentrations of chemicals were added to cells 4 h prior to infection. To
determine the neutralization ability of antibodies, serially diluted antibodies were
added to cells 1 h prior to infection. SARS-2-Spp preincubated with HDL at 25 °C for
2 h were applied to the cells pretreated with chemicals or antibodies and infected at
37 °C for 24 h. After SARS-2-Spp infection, the efficiency of viral entry was
determined through a firefly luciferase assay. Specifically, cells were washed with
PBS once, and then 16 μL of Cell Culture Lysis Reagent (E153A, Promega) was
added to each well. Then, the plate was incubated for 15 min with rocking at RT, after
which cell lysate (8 μL) from each well was added to a 384-well plate (#3574,
Corning) followed by the addition of 16 μL of Luciferase Assay Substrate (#E151A,
Promega). Luciferase activity measurements were performed on a Spark 20M
multimode microplate reader (Tecan). All infection experiments were performed in a
biosafety level-2 (BSL-2) laboratory. Cells without viruses, HDL and chemicals were

controls. All the infection experiments were performed in a biosafety level-2 (BSL-2)
laboratory.
Western blot analysis and immunoprecipitation
Cells were lysed in NP40 cell lysis buffer with fresh protease inhibitors. Supernatants
were separated by SDS-PAGE gel after centrifugation and transferred to PVDF
membranes for immunoblotting analyses using the indicated primary antibodies. Then,
an aliquot of the total lysate (5%, v/v) was included as a control for the interaction
assay, and immunoprecipitation was performed with the indicated antibodies. Then,
anti-rabbit or anti-mouse HRP-conjugated antibodies were applied after 3 washes and
the antigen-antibody complexes were visualized using chemiluminescence.
Infection with authentic SARS-CoV-2
The SARS-CoV-2 strain (2019-nCoV BetaCoV/Beijing/AMMS01/2020) used in the
present study was isolated from the lung lavage fluid of an infected patient and
preserved in the State Key Laboratory of Pathogen and Biosecurity at Beijing Institute
of Microbiology and Epidemiology. All the experiments involving viruses were
performed in the BSL-3 Laboratory of the Beijing Institute of Microbiology and
Epidemiology.
For HDL: Vero cells (1.6 ×105 cells/mL) were infected with the SARS-CoV-2 isolate
(MOI=0.001) preincubated with the indicated concentrations of HDL at 37 °C for 1 h.
For chemicals and antibodies, Vero E6 or Huh-7 cells (1.6 ×105 cells/mL) were
cultured in a 96-well plate at 37 °C overnight. Then, the supernatant was discarded,

and 100 μL of medium containing different concentrations of drugs was added to the
wells of the plates and were incubated for 4 h (chemicals) or 1 h (for antibodies) prior
to infection. Then, the cells were infected with the SARS-CoV-2 isolate (MOI=0.001)
preincubated with the indicated concentration of HDL at 37 °C for 1 h.
For SR-B1 expression, Vero cells (1.6 ×105 cells/mL) were transfected with a plasmid
encoding SR-B1, while Huh-7 cells (1.6 ×105 cells/mL) were transfected with siRNA
oligos for SR-B1. After 24 h, cells were washed with PBS and infected with the
SARS-CoV-2 isolate (MOI=0.001) that was preincubated with the indicated
concentration of HDL at 37 °C for 1 h.
After 1 h of infection, the above cells were washed three times with PBS before 200

μL of DMEM medium was added. Then, at 24 h post infection, cells were harvested
for viral RNA extraction with a viral RNA kit (52906, QIAGEN) according to the

Cells were washed with PBS 2 times and incubated with APC-conjugated (APC
anti-SR-B1) antibody (1:100) or anti-ACE2 antibody (1:100) followed by a secondary
incubation with donkey-anti-rabbit antibody (1:200) conjugated to Alexa Flour 488.
Measurement of cellular fluorescence was determined by FACS. Thirty thousand
events were registered for each experiment. Cellular fluorescence was quantitated by
mean fluorescence intensity (MFI) or percent positive cells.
Binding assay.
For SARS-2-S-cell surface binding, cells or cells transfected with HA-SR-B1 were
detached in PBS and washed with PBS at 24 h after transfection. SARS-2-S proteins
(140 nM) and HDL (6 μg/mL) preincubated at 37 °C for 1 h were then added to cells.
After incubating at RT for 30 min, the cells were washed two times with PBS
containing 2% FBS and then incubated for 30 min at RT with a PE-conjugated
antibody (PE anti-His tag). Then, the cells were washed again with PBS containing
2% FBS, after which binding was detected by flow cytometry. The cells were
analyzed on an Invitrogen Attune NxT Acoustic Focusing cytometer using Flowjo
V10.0.7. At least 10,000 cells were analyzed for each sample.
Internalization assay.
To monitor SARS-2-Spp entry, 293T cells transfected with GFP-SR-B1 were
detached in PBS and washed with PBS at 24 h after transfection. SARS-2-Spp
preincubated with HDL at 37 °C for 1 h was applied to the cells at RT for 1 h and

°

then shifted to 37 C for 3 h. The cells were then washed with PBS two times, after
which they were fixed, permeabilized, and blocked with 3% BSA. SARS-CoV-2

(2019-nCoV) Spike S1 antibody, rabbit MAb and Alexa Fluor 555-labeled donkey
anti-rabbit IgG (H+L) were used to bind SARS-2-Spp. Virion localization was
assayed by immunofluorescence microscopy.
Immunohistochemistry
Immunohistochemical staining for ACE2 and SR-B1 was performed on the
paraffin-embedded human normal organ tissue microarray (MNO661, Biomax).
Antigen retrieval was performed by placing the slides in 10 mM sodium citrate buffer
(pH 6.0) and maintained at a subboiling temperature for 10 min. After blocking in 1%
normal goat serum, the sections were incubated with ACE2 or SR-B1 monoclonal
antibodies at 4°C overnight in a humidified chamber, which was followed by an
incubation with HRP-labeled goat anti-mouse IgG secondary antibody (Beijing ZSGB
Biotechnology, ZDR-5307). Subsequently, the sections were incubated with a goat
anti-rabbit IgG secondary antibody (HRP) (Beijing ZSGB Biotechnology, PV9001)
for 60 min and then visualized with 3,30-diaminobenzidine tetrahydrochloride (DAB).
The slices were viewed under an Olympus microscope.
Statistical methods
In the present study, GraphPad Prism 8.0 was used for statistical calculations and data
plotting. Differences between two independent samples were evaluated by two-tailed
Student’s t-tests. Differences between multiple samples were analyzed by one-way
ANOVA followed by Bonferroni’s post hoc analysis. All tests were two-tailed, unless
otherwise indicated. We considered a P value ≤ 0.05 to be statistically significant.
Significance values were set as follows: ns (not significant), P > 0.05; *, P < 0.05; **,
