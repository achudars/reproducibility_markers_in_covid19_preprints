Abstract
In 2019 the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) caused the first documented
cases of severe lung disease COVID-19. Since then, SARS-CoV-2 has been spreading around the globe
resulting in a severe pandemic with over 500.000 fatalities and large economical and social disruptions in
human societies. Gaining knowledge on how SARS-Cov-2 interacts with its host cells and causes
COVID-19 is crucial for the intervention of novel therapeutic strategies. SARS-CoV-2, like other
coronaviruses, is a positive​-​strand RNA virus. The viral RNA is modified by RNA-modifying enzymes
provided by the host cell. Direct RNA sequencing (DRS) using nanopores enables unbiased sensing of
canonical and modified RNA bases of the viral transcripts. In this work, we used DRS to precisely
annotate the open reading frames and the landscape of SARS-CoV-2 RNA modifications. We provide the
first DRS data of SARS-CoV-2 in infected human lung epithelial cells. From sequencing three isolates,
we derive a robust identification of SARS-CoV-2 modification sites within a physiologically relevant
host cell type. A comparison of our data with the DRS data from a previous SARS-CoV-2 isolate, both
raised in monkey renal cells, reveals consistent RNA modifications across the viral genome. Conservation
of the RNA modification pattern during progression of the current pandemic suggests that this pattern is
likely essential for the life cycle of SARS-CoV-2 and represents a possible target for drug interventions.

Introduction
Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is an RNA virus that causes
coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). The ongoing COVID-19 pandemic has put an enormous burden
on human society in 2020 and is expected to have even longer-lasting impacts. Despite tremendous
ongoing research efforts, we still do not have sufficient antiviral treatment solutions or a vaccine. Over
the last two decades, the closely related zoonotic betacoronaviruses SARS-CoV and MERS have
caused recurring outbreaks in the human population. The ability of coronaviruses (CoV) for
cross-species transmission, their known reservoirs in multiple species, and their high replication rates
keep CoVs a threat for the human population even beyond the 2020 pandemic. Understanding the
molecular mechanisms behind the replication of SARS-CoV-2 is urgently needed.
SARS-CoV-2 carries an enveloped positive-sense single-stranded RNA genome (~30kb) encoding a
dense collection of structural and non-structural proteins (nsp), and accessory proteins. Like other
members of the order Nidovirales, the genome encodes two polyproteins followed by a series of ORFs
that are transcribed into sub-genomic RNAs (sgRNAs). Each transcribed sgRNA is thought to be
translated into one protein, and its 3’ untranslated region overlaps with the coding sequence of the
shorter downstream sgRNAs (1,2). Upon cell entry, ORF1a and ORF1b can be translated directly from
the viral genome. A −1 ribosomal frameshifting upstream of the ORF1a stop codon allows the translation
of ORF1b (3). The resulting polyproteins, pp1a and pp1b, are further cleaved by viral proteases and yield
11 and 15 nsps, respectively. The RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRP) nsp12 performs the
genome replication and the transcription of sgRNAs through negative-sense RNA template
intermediates. To transcribe the sgRNAs, the negative RNA intermediates undergo discontinuous
transcription, in which the RdRP skips the genome region between transcription-regulatory sequences
(TRS) located at the 5’ end of the ORFs (TRS-B sites) and a corresponding TRS-Leader site at the 5’
end of the viral genome (for a review please see Sola ​et al. ​(1)). As a consequence, viral sgRNAs share
a common 5’ leader sequence derived from the 5’ end of the genome up to the TRS-L site. Like host
mRNAs, the viral genomic RNA and the sgRNAs have a methylated 5’ cap and a polyadenylated 3’ tail.
Still, the transcriptomic aspect of CoVs, including SARS-CoV-2, is not fully understood. Transcript-level
regulation of gene expression is widely used by the native cellular mechanisms of the host. Viruses have
adopted and hijacked these mechanisms throughout their evolution (4). Understanding the biochemical
characteristics of SARS-CoV-2 genomic and sgRNA molecules can provide valuable information for
developing novel drug targets and optimizing the application of available therapeutics and mRNA-based
vaccine development. The multifaceted functional aspects of RNA modifications have only recently been
acknowledged and confirmed by several studies that have shown the important role of RNA
modifications in the regulation of gene expression (5). Several studies indicate that RNA modifications
play a pivotal role for viral infection and host defence (6,7).

More than 140 types of RNA modifications have been identified until now (8). While several protocols
exist for the detection of nucleotide modifications such as RIP-seq, each assay can typically only identify
one specific modification type. Raising specific antibodies to detect the growing number of known
modifications remains an additional challenge (9). Direct RNA sequencing using Oxford Nanopore
technologies (ONT) enables intermediate-free sensing of the nucleotides from the deviations in electrical
signals while the RNA passes through the sequencing pores. The applicability of ONT-based solutions
for detecting RNA modifications has been demonstrated in several studies (10), including work on
SARS-CoV-1 (11).
Here, we study SARS-CoV-2 RNA modifications by direct sequencing of RNA from a human lung cell
line infected with SARS-CoV-2. We present an extensive analysis of RNA modification patterns based on
the sequencing of three virus isolates using two different modification prediction methods in a consistent
manner. Furthermore, we reevaluate and compare our results to data from two previous reports of
SARS-CoV-2 direct RNA sequencing experiments (12,13), which have analyzed the RNA modification of
SARS-CoV-2 cultured in Vero (African green monkey kidney) cells, a cell line known to carry various
chromosomal deletions and genetic rearrangements (14). Our analysis confirms and extends the
previously reported results and, taken together, reveals that the transcripts of SARS-CoV-2 are
consistently modified in different host cells.

Results
Cultivation of SARS-CoV-2 and RNA extraction
The aim of our study was to provide a replicate based direct RNA sequencing analysis of European
SARS-CoV-2 to be able to analyze RNA modifications and predict the expressed viral transcripts. To this
end, we cultivated SARS-CoV-2 isolates from three independent patients (​Fr1​, ​Fr2​, ​Fr3​) from Munich
and Freiburg, including one of the first patients tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 in Germany. Isolate
stocks obtained from infected Vero cell cultures were used to infect Calu-3 cells, a human lung epithelial
cell line. We chose Calu-3 to study the viral RNA after infection of a disease-relevant human cell type.
After 24 hours, the RNA of the infected cultures was extracted for deep sequencing. We applied classical
short-read sequencing as well as direct RNA sequencing using nanopores. Short-read Illumina
sequencing of the samples was essential to obtain a high-confidence list of genomic variants present in
each isolate (Table S1). For nanopore sequencing, we used an ONT MinION sequencing device and
sequenced poly-A enriched RNAs.

Sequencing read statistics
The direct RNA sequencing experiments yielded a total of 2.3, 1.2 and 1.3 million sequencing reads for
the three samples. We mapped the sequences of each dataset to the combination of the human host

genome, the yeast enolase gene used as the ONT DRS spike, and the SARS-CoV-2 NCBI reference
genome. Notably, between 62-70% of the mapped reads were mapped to the virus genome (Fig. 1a),
which is very much comparable to the fraction of viral reads obtained by Kim ​et al. ​(12) using the Vero
host cell line (Fig. S1a). In contrast to Calu-3 cells which were used for this study, Vero cells are
interferon-deficient. Thus, our observation seems to indicate that the interferon deficiency of Vero cells
does not benefit the viral life cycle to an experimentally relevant extent. This is in line with a recent study
analyzing the host transcription response to SARS-CoV-2 infection (15).

SARS-CoV-2 TRS-B sites and subgenomic RNAs
The long RNA sequencing reads generated for this study cover the entire SARS-CoV-2 genomic RNA as
well as the different ORFs (Fig 1b,c, Fig. S1b). This allowed us to do an in-depth analysis of the genomic
junctions, including the TRS-B sites described by Kim ​et al. (12). For comparability, we downloaded and
reanalysed the DRS dataset published by Kim ​et al. and included it in our junction site analysis and
downstream evaluations. Data from this dataset are designated as ​Kr​.
Our scan of candidate landing regions upstream of predicted ORFs, and alternative start codons within
them, monitored a total of 16 genomic regions and classified sequencing reads by the region they
support (the result of this classification can be seen in Supplementary Table S2). Manual inspection of
alignments of each class of reads enabled us to re-identify known TRS-B sites and to discover novel
ones. We used this list of observed TRS-B sites for a more stringent classification of reads, which only
considered reads supporting a junction between the TRS-L and one of the observed TRS-B sites. The
results of this reclassification are shown in Table 1 and Figure 1c and confirm the existence of
functionally active TRS-B sites upstream of all predicted ORFs except for ORF10. In agreement with Kim
et al.​, we find evidence for an additional functionally active TRS-B site predicted to enable translation,
from an alternative downstream start codon, of an ORF7b short isoform lacking the first 23 amino acids
of the annotated protein.
We compared the sequence contexts of the TRS-B sites of the two alternative ORF7b sgRNA isoforms
with the TRS-L motif of the SARS-CoV-2 genome. We observed that transcription of sgRNAs for both the
long and the short ORF7b isoform depends on imperfect TRS-B core motifs, AaGAAC and ttGAAC,
respectively, instead of ACGAAC, which may explain the low number of observed reads supporting
these two sgRNAs compared to those of other ORFs. In line with Kim ​et al.​, we do not find evidence for
the predicted ORF10 sgRNA. However, we find weak support for an imperfect TRS-B site downstream of
the presumed start codon of ORF10. The potential TRS-B site sequence, TAA ACG TTT carries a triplet
deletion in the ACGAAC core motif, but shows identity to TRS-L in the three 5’ and 3’ flanking bases,
respectively. Intriguingly, all three samples sequenced as part of this work have reasonable numbers of
reads (> 100 per sample) supporting the usage of the site, while our reanalysis of the ​Kr sample
confirmed a much smaller number (9) of such reads. sgRNA transcribed from this site could result in
translation from an alternative start codon within ORF10 that would produce a peptide of just 18 amino

acids compared to 38 of the predicted ORF10. Whether this potential peptide is of functional relevance
remains to be validated.

Detection of RNA modification
We mitigated the variability in the sgRNA expression levels and the ONT higher coverage bias at the
3’end of the transcripts by downsampling the collections of intact sgRNA reads. In this way, we get a
quasi-uniform distribution of intact reads across all the samples and the sgRNAs except for ORF7b (Fig.
S1b). For comparison, we also applied the same data processing workflows on datasets from Kim ​et al.
and Taiaroa ​et al.​ (7,8).
We used the intact reads that were identified and down-sampled in the previous step for RNA
modification detection by DRS using the two available in silico methods. For the identification of the
modification sites, we used two different approaches for harnessing the sensed electrical signals from
sequencing the native RNA molecules by nanopores. Typically, the electrical signal events aligned to
positions, called squiggles, are compared between a condition with unknown putative modifications and
a control condition. One strategy to detect the modified genomic positions is to compare the distribution
of squiggles of two conditions, both encoding the transcripts of interest. Another strategy uses trained
statistical models of the control condition to identify modification of the other condition by evaluating
disagreement between the observed features and the model expectations.
Two sets of Galaxy workflows based on Tombo (16) and Nanocompore (17) tools were designed to
compute the modification scores from the DRS data (Table S3). Both Tombo and Nanocompore support
the distribution-based strategy while Tombo further can perform model-based modification detection.
Since Nanocompore supports biological replicates, we used it as the distribution-based strategy for
calling modifications from the three replicates (Fig. 2a). We further used Tombo to train models and
calculate modification scores for individual samples (Fig. 2b). To this end, we utilized the in vitro
transcribed (IVT) data of SARS-CoV-2 from Kim ​et al. ​as the unmodified RNA control dataset for both
Tombo and Nanocompore. The distribution of the signals derived from virus RNA and unmodified RNA is
representatively depicted for Fr3 in Figure 3.

RNA modification sites of SARS-CoV-2 sgRNAs
We identified the positions modified in SARS-CoV-2 sgRNAs for all the sgRNAs and among all the
datasets (Fig. 2a,b). We specifically focused on the modifications regions of the sub-genomic RNAs, i.e.,
the region downstream of the associated TRS-B sites. We excluded the genomic reads due to the
moderately low number of intact reads. The modification results for 5’leader was also not considered due
to the anomalies observed in the read coverage of the 5'leader site (Figure 1b).
By comparing the model-based prediction for the presented datasets (Fr1-3), we identified a high level of
correlation between the modification rates of sgRNA positions in the three replicates (Figure 2b). This

prompted us to perform a correlation analysis as depicted in Figure 4 representatively for sgRNA S and
N. Notably, this analysis revealed a high correlation not only for the modification sites but also for the
fractions of modification between biological replicates. We therefore tested the correlation between our
data and the previously published data (Kr) (Fig. 4). Remarkably, the top-ranked modification sites are
consistent and the correlation of the fraction of RNA modification fractions is high (Fig. 4), too. This
observation was confirmed by visual inspection of raw signals ( examples are shown in Fig. 5). We
excluded the data of the Australian isolate from this analysis due to the relatively lower read coverage
and different ratio of viral reads (Fig. S1a).
The large overlap of highly modified sites predicted by two independent algorithms supports the validity
of our analysis and findings. However, for sites with a low modification ratio the predicted significance
levels differ sometimes, indicating that additional biological replicates are needed to consistently reach a
valid significance level.

Conclusions
RNA modifications are essential modulators of RNA stability and function. The recent invention of direct
RNA sequencing protocols using nanopores enable unbiased detection of RNA modification. In general,
the analysis of DRS raw signals is challenging and not well standardized and thus only possible for
experienced bioinformaticians. To enable more researchers to use this technology, we present two
highly standardized analysis pipelines for DRS sequencing data. These pipelines were integrated into
the Galaxy platform (18) and are accessible at ​https://covid19.galaxyproject.org/direct-rnaseq together
with workflows for mapping reads to the viral genome, for calling genomic variants, and for identifying
and extracting sgRNA-derived reads. Using these pipelines we analyzed the DRS data sets generated
for this study, serving as the first DRS data from Europe, and compared it with the data from previous
studies.
Here we generated the SARS-CoV-2 DRS sequencing data sets for the first time for three biological
replicates. In contrast, to previously published data, viruses were cultured in a disease-relevant human
epithelial lung cell line. Remarkably, the infection resulted in more than 60% of poly-A enriched RNA
reads from SARS-CoV-2. We provide experimental evidence for transcription of a total of 11 sgRNAs,
two of which are not part of the public SARS-CoV-2 reference annotation.
The comparative analysis of our three replicates with published data demonstrates a high degree of
similarity between isolates from different continents and at both early and recent stages of the epidemie.
Even the use of alternative host cells had little impact on the overall pattern of sgRNA transcription and
RNA modifications. This high degree of conservation suggests that RNA modifications are relevant for
the life cycle of SARS-CoV-2. Targeting of RNA modifying enzymes thus represents a novel therapeutic
strategy. To test this hypothesis future studies have to identify and target the enzymes modifying the
SARS-Cov-2 RNA and the associated RNA binding proteins. Although our results do not indicate the

type of RNA modification, it provides a robust basis for detecting the different ribonucleoside
modifications of SARS-CoV-2 in the future.

Materials and methods
All work involving live SARS-CoV-2 was performed in the BSL-3 facility of the Institute of Virology,
University Hospital Freiburg, and was approved according to the German Act of Genetic Engineering by
the local authority (Regierungspräsidium Tübingen, permit UNI.FRK.05.16/05).

Virus cultivation
SARS-CoV-2 isolates were propagated on VeroE6 cells (ATCC® CRL-1586) in Dulbecco's Modified
Eagle Medium (DMEM) with 2% FCS. For virus stocks, the cells were infected with a multiplication of
infection (moi) of 0.001, supernatants were harvested after 50 h and aliquots stored at -80°C. Viral titers
in the culture supernatants were determined using plaque-assays. The virus isolates used in this study
were Muc-IMB-1/2020 (Bundeswehr Institute of Microbiology, Munich, Germany), FR/291.9/2020 and
FR/291.13/2020 (Institute of Virology, Medical Center-University of Freiburg).

Cells and infection
Calu-3 cells (ATCC® HTB-55™) were cultivated in DMEM supplemented with 5 % fetal bovine serum at
37°C and 5 % CO​2​. Cells were infected by washing confluent cells once with PBS and incubating them at
a moi of 0.1 with virus preparations diluted in Opti-MEM for 1.5 h at RT. After the infection, fresh medium
containing DMEM with 1 % FCS and 20 mM HEPES was supplied. The cells were harvested 24 h post
infection to prepare total RNA.

Viral RNA, total RNA and mRNA preparation
For Illumina cDNA RNA-seq, viral RNA was prepared from 200 µl of clarified virus stocks (3.000 rpm, 5
min) with the Quick-RNA Viral Kit (Zymo research) and eluted in 14 µl RNase free H​2​0. For Nanopore
direct RNA sequencing, total RNA was isolated using the NucleoSpin RNA, Mini kit (macherey nagel)
according to the manufacturers’ instructions. For each sample 1x10​6 cells were lysed in 350 µl RA1
(supplemented with 3.5 μL ß-mercaptoethanol) and the RNA eluted in 50 µl RNase free H​2​0. RNA
concentration and purity was quantified with a Qubit fluorometer (Quant-iT™ RNA HS Assay-Kit,
ThermoFisher) and a Nanodrop (ThermoFisher), respectively. mRNA was prepared from total RNA by
magnetic mRNA purification (Magnetic mRNA Isolation Kit,NEB) according to the manufacturer's'
instructions with the following deviation: 50 µl purified total RNA (30-50 µg) was incubated with 450 µl
Binding Buffer and added to 100 µl magnetic beads. The mRNA was eluted in 55 µl EB Buffer (Qiagen).
To concentrate the mRNA, 99 µl Agencourt RNAclean XP (Beckman Coulter Life Sciences) were added

and incubated at RT for 15 min. The magnetic beads were pelleted on a magnetic stand, washed twice
in 70 % EtOH and dried for 5 - 10 min. Afterwards the mRNA was eluted in 11 µl RNase free H​2​0.

Illumina cDNA RNA-seq
RNA-seq libraries (TruSeq® Stranded Total RNA Library Prep Human/Mouse/Rat, Illumina) were
prepared from 150 ng of previously isolated viral RNA according to the manufacturers’ protocol. 10 pM
pooled libraries were loaded onto a MiSeq cartridge (MiSeq Reagent Kit v2, Illumina) and run on a
MiSeq (paired end, 300 cycles).

Nanopore direct RNA sequencing
0,5 -1 µg of purified mRNA was subjected to direct RNA library preparation (SQK-RNA002, Oxford
Nanopore Technologies) following the manufacturers’ instructions with the following deviations:
Superscript IV (ThermoFisher) instead of Superscript III was used and the reverse transcription was
performed for 2 h. The final library was loaded on a FLO-MIN106 flowcell and sequenced on a MinION
(Oxford Nanopore Technologies) for 48 - 72 h, depending on the active channel count (MinKnow v3.6.5,
Guppy v3.2.10).

Quantification and Statistical analysis
Availability of analysis workflows and input data
The development of all analysis workflows used for the bioinformatic evaluation of the sequencing data
was carried as part of the Covid-19 initiative of the Galaxy project (19). All Galaxy workflows and
additional required inputs to them (beyond the sequencing data) are available from the Direct RNAseq
subpage of the project at ​https://covid19.galaxyproject.org/direct-rnaseq​.

Assignment of sequenced reads to viral transcripts
Mapping of the sequence reads to the corresponding genomes, extraction of ​intact reads and
assignment to the sgRNAs were performed on the European Galaxy server.
For mapping, the ONT reads of each sample were first mapped to a virtual genome combined of the host
(hg38) and the SARS-CoV-2 reference (NC_045512.2) genomes, as well as host rDNA (U13369.1) and
ENO spike sequence using Minimap2 (20). The subset of reads that mapped to the viral genome was
isolated using samtools (21) and served as input for a second round of mapping to only the viral genome
and Minimap2 parameters optimized for the alignment of viral cross-junction sequences similar to Kim ​et
al.. The complete mapping steps can be reproduced using our ​Read mapping to viral genome Galaxy
workflow.
For the extraction of intact reads carrying the viral leader sequence and assignment of these reads to
viral sgRNAs, we used a two-step strategy. First, we used bedtools (22) and samtools to extract reads,

for which the mapping supported a junction between the viral TRS-L site and putative landing regions
upstream of any potential longer ORF beyond ORF1ab. The list of landing region candidates used at this
step includes the regions between each of the predicted structural ORFs and the next intervening
upstream start codon, but also correspondingly defined regions upstream of potential alternative start
codons within the S, 3a, M, 7b, N and 10 ORFs and enables a relatively unbiased detection of junction
sites independent of prior assumptions about TRS-B sites.
Next, we inspected the resulting reads classifications with IGV (23) for evidence of junction events and
used this information to build a list of TRS-B sites the use of which is supported by the sequencing data.
This list was then used in a second round of assignment of reads to viral sgRNAs, in which only reads
supporting a junction event between the TRS-L site and any of the confirmed TRS-B sites (with 10
flanking bases on each side to account for alignment ambiguities around the junction sites) were
considered.
Both read classification strategies can be reproduced using Galaxy workflows to ​classify ONT reads by
candidate junction and to ​classify ONT reads by confirmed junction sites​, respectively. We have also
made available the complete list of landing region candidates and confirmed TRS-B site regions used in
these workflows.

Genomic variant analysis and masking of isolate variant sites
Genomic variants present in the viral isolates were identified from the MiSeq-sequenced reads data
using the Galaxy workflow for variation analysis with paired-end data previously developed for the
Covid-19 initiative of the Galaxy project. The exact version of the workflow used for the analyses
described here is available together with the other workflows used in this study. A list of consensus
variants identified in the three samples can be found as Supplementary Table S2.
Before computing RNA the modification score, the union of these identified variant sites for Fr1-3 plus
the variants reported for Kr and Au samples were masked to avoid reporting mutations as false-positive
modification signals. The genomic regions posing a high deviation in the coverage due to the overlaps at

RNA modification detection
The collections of FASTQ-formatted intact reads with the viral leader sequence were used as input to
Tombo. First, ​tombo preprocess and ​tombo resquiggle commands were invoked on the FASTQ
files and the associated FAST5 collection (option --rna). Tombo detect_modification was invoked using

al. The subcommand level_sample_compare was also applied with the same configuration (data not
shown). The methylation scores were extracted from the computed statistics using the subcommand
text_output browser_files --file-types dampened_fraction. The plots for ionic signals were also
generated using Tombo.
The second workflow for distribution-based comparison of conditions was developed in Galaxy using
Nanocompore and Nanopolish (17,24). To align the raw sequencing event data to the reference
genome, Nanopolish subcommand ​eventalign was used (options --samples --scale-events
--print-read-names) (17). The alignments produced in the previous step in BAM format and the
associated reads in fastq format were provided to the Nanopolish tool. In the next step, the tabular output
of event alignment was treated by removing the rows for the portion of the events that were aligned to
the first 100 positions of the genome that covers the leader region using awk. This step has been
necessary to have a proper utilization of Nanocompore tool that does not natively support spliced
alignments. In the next step the event_align data was processed using NanopolishComp

Figure 1: Direct RNA sequencing of SARS-CoV-2 infected Calu-3 human cell lines. ​a: ​Mapping statistics
for reads obtained from human epithelial cells infected with three independent virus isolates. Given is the
fraction of reads mapping to the human genome, ONT control ENO, and SARS-CoV-2. More than 60%
of the mapped reads aligned to the virus genome. The subset of viral reads that span over the 5’ leader
sequence are designated as ​intact reads. ​b: ​top panel, the coverage of viral reads across the
SARS-CoV-2 genome with a truncated axis in case of ORF1ab. Bottom panel, the coverage of sgRNA
reads with a leader sequence. ​c: Relative abundance of viral reads assigned to sgRNAs based on their
support of canonical and newly observed TRS-B site usage. A linear scale is used to show the
magnitude of expression differences. The inset shows a magnification of the three most lowly expressed
sgRNAs. Fr1-3, three German virus isolates, this study; Kr, Korean isolate

Tables
Table 1: TRS sites for which evidence has been observed in this study. For each TRS we list the
following: its position as 1-based start position of the core motif; its core sequence and the three bases
flanking it on each side; the supporting read counts in each of the three samples from this study and in
the reanalyzed Kr sample (for the TRS-L site, these counts are simply the sum of all the TRS-B counts
since reads were required to support junctions between TRS-L and one of the TRS-B sites to be
considered).
