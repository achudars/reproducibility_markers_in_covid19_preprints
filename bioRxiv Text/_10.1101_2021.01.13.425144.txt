SUMMARY

33

COVID-19 is a respiratory disease caused by SARS-CoV-2, a betacoronavirus. Here,

34

we show that in a widely used transgenic mouse model of COVID-19, lethality is

35

invariably associated with viral neuroinvasion and the ensuing neuronal disease, while

36

lung inflammation remains moderate.

37

ABSTRACT

38

Animal models recapitulating the distinctive features of severe COVID-19 are critical to

39

enhance our understanding of SARS-CoV-2 pathogenesis. Transgenic mice expressing

40

human angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (hACE2) under the cytokeratin 18 promoter

41

(K18-hACE2) represent a lethal model of SARS-CoV-2 infection. However, the cause(s)

42

and mechanisms of lethality in this mouse model remain unclear. Here, we evaluated

43

the spatiotemporal dynamics of SARS-CoV-2 infection for up to 14 days post-infection.

44

Despite infection and moderate inflammation in the lungs, lethality was invariably

45

associated with viral neuroinvasion and neuronal damage (including spinal motor

46

neurons). Neuroinvasion occurred following virus transport through the olfactory

47

neuroepithelium in a manner that was only partially dependent on hACE2. Interestingly,

48

SARS-CoV-2 tropism was overall neither widespread among nor restricted to only

49

ACE2-expressing cells. Although our work incites caution in the utility of the K18-hACE2

50

model to study global aspects of SARS-CoV-2 pathogenesis, it underscores this model

51

as a unique platform for exploring the mechanisms of SARS-CoV-2 neuropathogenesis.

INTRODUCTION

53

The world is experiencing the devastating effects of the Coronavirus Disease 2019

54

(COVID-19) pandemic, a highly contagious viral respiratory disease caused by the

55

newly emerged betacoronavirus, Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus-2

56

(SARS-CoV-2) (Andersen et al., 2020; Coronaviridae Study Group of the International

57

Committee on Taxonomy of, 2020; Wang et al., 2020a). The initial index case was

58

reported at a seafood market in Wuhan, Hubei Province, China in late 2019 (Andersen

59

et al., 2020). While still under investigation, it has been postulated that the progenitor of

60

SARS-CoV-2 may have originated from horseshoe bats (Rhinolophus affinis) or

61

Malayan pangolins (Manis javanica) that, following spill over into humans, acquired the

62

genomic features leading to adaptation and human-to-human transmission (Andersen et

63

al., 2020). SARS-CoV-2 has a high transmissibility rate and, to date, it has infected

64

nearly 84.5 million people with over 1.8 million fatalities (Johns Hopkins University &

65

Medicine, 2020). COVID-19 causes respiratory disease of variable severity, ranging

66

from mild to severe, with the development of acute respiratory distress syndrome

67

(ARDS) requiring intensive care and mechanical ventilation (Goyal et al., 2020;

68

Tenforde et al., 2020; Wang et al., 2020a; Wang et al., 2020b). Numerous comorbidities

69

including hypertension, obesity and diabetes, among others, are affiliated with an

70

increased risk of developing severe COVID-19 (Goyal et al., 2020; Simonnet et al.,

71

2020; Tartof et al., 2020; Team, 2020; Tenforde et al., 2020). Furthermore, a proportion

72

of infected patients develop poorly understood neurological signs and/or symptoms

73

mostly associated with the loss of smell and taste (anosmia and ageusia), headache,

74

dizziness, encephalopathy (delirium), and ischemic injury (stroke), among other

75

uncommon symptoms (DosSantos et al., 2020; Eliezer et al., 2020; Ellul et al., 2020;

76

Goyal et al., 2020; Lee et al., 2020; Liu et al., 2020; Solomon et al., 2020; Walker et al.,

77

2020; Wang et al., 2020b). Recently, SARS-CoV-2 RNA and antigen has been reported

78

in the brain of COVID-19 patients and the olfactory mucosa postulated as a port of entry

79

(Meinhardt et al., 2020). COVID-19 has severely challenged health care systems

80

around the globe, with the urgent need for medical countermeasures including the

81

development of efficacious vaccines and therapeutics.

82

Animal models permissive to SARS-CoV-2 that could serve as suitable models to

83

understand the pathogenesis of COVID-19 and as preclinical models for the evaluation

84

of vaccine and therapeutic targets are critically needed (Johansen et al., 2020;

85

McNamara et al., 2020; Munoz-Fontela et al., 2020). While various animal models

86

(mice, hamsters, non-human primates, ferrets, minks, dogs, and cats) have been

87

evaluated to date (Gaudreault et al., 2020; Imai et al., 2020; Meekins et al., 2020;

88

Munoz-Fontela et al., 2020; Rockx et al., 2020; Shi et al., 2020; Shuai et al., 2020; Sia

89

et al., 2020; Winkler et al., 2020), none faithfully recapitulates all of the pathological

90

features of COVID-19. The main limitation in the development of suitable murine models

91

of COVID-19 is related to the virus entry mechanism: SARS-CoV-2 binds to target cells

92

via interaction between the viral spike protein (S) and the host angiotensin-converting

93

enzyme 2 (ACE2), considered to be the major host entry receptor (Hoffmann et al.,

94

2020). The low binding affinity between the S protein and murine ACE2 (mACE2)

95

renders conventional mouse strains naturally resistant to infection, posing a challenge in

96

the development of murine models of COVID-19 (Conceicao et al., 2020; Damas et al.,

97

2020; Dinnon et al., 2020). These difficulties have been circumvented by the

98

development of transgenic murine models that express human ACE2 (hACE2) under

99

different promoters including cytomegalovirus (CMV), hepatocyte nuclear factor-

100

3/forkhead homologue 4 (HFH4), and cytokeratin 18 (K18) (Jiang et al., 2020; McCray

101

et al., 2007; Rathnasinghe et al., 2020; Winkler et al., 2020; Zheng et al., 2020). The

102

transgenic murine model expressing hACE2 under a K18 promoter (namely K18-

103

hACE2) was developed by McCray et al in 2007 to study SARS-CoV (McCray et al.,

104

2007), which shares the same host receptor as SARS-CoV-2 (Li et al., 2003).

105

SARS-CoV-2 infection of K18-hACE2 mice results in up to 100% lethality similar to what

106

has been reported for SARS-CoV (McCray et al., 2007; Winkler et al., 2020; Zheng et

107

al., 2020). Lethality was reported to be associated with lung inflammation and impaired

108

respiratory function, suggesting that this model can recapitulate features of the

109

respiratory disease observed in severe cases of COVID-19 (Rathnasinghe et al., 2020;

110

Winkler et al., 2020; Zheng et al., 2020). While several studies have reported SARS-

111

CoV-2 neuroinvasion and neurological signs of disease in infected K18-hACE2 mice

112

(Golden et al., 2020; Zheng et al., 2020), the contribution of CNS disease in the

113

lethality of the model and the mechanism by which neuroinvasion occurs, remain

114

unclear.

115

Under K18 regulation, the expression of hACE2 is reported to be limited mainly to

116

airway epithelial cells and enterocytes lining the colonic mucosa, to a lower degree

117

within kidney, liver, spleen and small intestine, and a minor level of expression in the

118

brain (McCray et al., 2007). However, the cellular distribution of ACE2, and particularly

119

hACE2, in tissues of K18-hACE2 mice remains largely undetermined. We hypothesized

120

that the nature, severity, and outcome of disease in K18-hACE2 mouse model is not

121

solely dictated by the expression and tissue distribution of hACE2 and that increased

122

lethality in this model is related to neuroinvasion. To investigate this hypothesis, we

123

undertook a comprehensive spatiotemporal analysis of histologic changes, cellular

124

distribution and abundance of viral antigen and RNA along with detailed analysis of the

125

distribution of hACE2 and its correlation with SARS-CoV-2 tropism.

126

Although SARS-CoV-2 antigen and RNA could be detected in ACE2-expressing cells

127

such as olfactory neuroepithelium (ONE) and alveolar type 2 (AT2) cells, we found that

128

SARS-CoV-2 primarily infected neurons and alveolar type 1 (AT1) cells lacking ACE2

129

expression. The lethality of the K18-hACE2 model was entirely due to viral

130

neuroinvasion, which occurred through the olfactory neuroepithelium. This process was

131

accompanied by clinically detectable neurological manifestations, and was partially

132

driven by ACE2-independent mechanisms. Altogether, this study expands the current

133

knowledge on the K18-hACE2 murine model to study COVID-19. Our findings will help

134

refine its utilization for providing a relevant understanding of the molecular mechanisms

135

driving neuropathogenesis and pulmonary pathology.

136

137

RESULTS

138

SARS-CoV-2 is invariably fatal in infected K18-hACE2 mice with evidence of

139

neuroinvasion. K18-hACE2 mice inoculated intranasally with SARS-CoV-2 (1x106

140

plaque-forming units [PFU]; n=47 [n=25 male and n=12 female) began losing weight as

141

early as 2-3 days post-infection (dpi) irrespective of sex, with maximum weight loss

142

occurring at 7 dpi (17.7% ± 7.8% in male mice, 21.8% ± 3.1% in female, and combined

143

18.9% ± 6.9%; Figure 1A). Trends in weight loss were associated with an increase in

144

clinical scores and a decline in core body temperature, both of which became most

145

pronounced near the time of death (Figure 1B-C). SARS-CoV-2-infected K18-hACE2

146

mice exhibited neurological signs by 6-7 dpi, characterized by tremors, proprioceptive

147

defects, abnormal gait and imbalance. The majority of the animals were either

148

euthanized at this time or were found dead in their cage (93%; 28/30 [Figure 1D]). At

149

the time of death (7-10 dpi), the median clinical score was 3 (interquartile range = 2)

150

and the mean body temperature 30.6 ± 3.7 °C. Two male mice survived to the end of

151

the 14-day observation period. One of these animals had a maximum clinical score of

152

3/5 at 10 dpi and lost a maximum of 6% body weight, while the other displayed no

153

clinical signs or appreciable weight loss over the observation period. Furthermore,

154

neither of the two male survivors were hypothermic at any point in time, a feature that

155

was consistently observed in animals that succumbed to disease.

156

When compared with C57BL/6J mice, which were concomitantly infected with SARS-

157

CoV-2, the K18-hACE2 mice had several dark red, slightly depressed foci of variable

158

size (2-3 mm), scattered throughout the lung lobes at 2 and 4 dpi. By 7 dpi, these foci

159

grew into large coalescing, dark red depressions encompassing around 30% of the

160

pulmonary parenchyma, leading to the abnormal pulmonary buoyancy (i.e. tissues sank

161

when placed in formalin). Additionally, the mice euthanized due to clinical deterioration

162

frequently had a markedly dilated urinary bladder filled with concentrated urine. The

163

mice euthanized at 14 dpi (n=2) had sporadic dark red pinpoint foci in the pulmonary

164

parenchyma.

165

Lethality was associated with significant viral load in the lung and brain of the K18-

166

hACE2 mice (Figure 1E), as previously reported (Golden et al., 2020; Rathnasinghe et

5

bioRxiv preprint doi: https://doi.org/10.1101/2021.01.13.425144; this version posted January 15, 2021. The copyright holder for this preprint

167

al., 2020; Winkler et al., 2020; Zheng et al., 2020). In the lung, viral RNA was detectable

168

at the earliest experimental timepoint (2 dpi), with a mean of 6.42x107 RNA copies/mg,

169

peaked at 4 dpi (mean of 5.8x108 RNA copies/mg) and remained high at 7 dpi (mean of

170

3.71x107 RNA copies/mg). In contrast, viral RNA in the brain was low at 2 dpi (mean of

171

2.46x105 RNA copies/mg) but dramatically increased at 7 dpi (4-log increase)

172

representing the highest viral RNA load during the course of the study, with a mean of

173

1.27x109 RNA copies/mg. A small amount of viral RNA was detected in the serum

174

(<106 RNA copies/ml). However, incubation of SARS-CoV-2 permissive cell lines (i.e.

175

Vero E6 cells) with serum samples did not result in any detectable productive infection

176

in vitro, confirming that K18-hACE2 are not viremic during infection and that small

177

amounts of naked viral RNA might be circulating in the bloodstream following release

178

from infected tissues (data not shown). Altogether, these data illustrate that lethality was

179

associated with increasing viral load in the brain until time of death, in contrast to lung

180

viral load.

181

182

Transient SARS-CoV-2 infection in the nasal cavity of K18-hACE2 mice. We next

183

performed detailed histologic analysis of various tissues to uncover the mechanism of

184

lethality in K18-hACE2 mice. For this, we first focused on the spatial and temporal

185

dynamics of SARS-CoV-2 infection in the upper respiratory tract and analyzed the

186

anterior/rostral nasal cavity and olfactory neuroepithelium for disease-associated

187

lesions. To do so, we performed a thorough sequential histologic analysis combined

188

with immunohistochemistry (IHC) and RNAscope® in situ hybridization (ISH) in order to

189

determine the cellular localization and abundance of SARS-CoV-2 antigen and RNA,

190

using an anti-spike monoclonal antibody and an S-specific RNA probe, respectively.

191

At 2 dpi, the anterior/rostral nasal cavity was characterized by mild, multifocal

192

neutrophilic inflammation (rhinitis) in all infected K18-hACE2 mice. In the rostral and

193

intermediate turbinates,

194

degeneration and necrosis of the lining transitional and respiratory epithelium, with cell

195

rounding, loss of cilia and sloughing, along with scattered intracytoplasmic SARS-CoV-2

196

antigen and RNA (Figure 2). Nasal passages were partially filled with small amounts of

197

cellular debris, degenerate neutrophils and small numbers of erythrocytes. The lamina

198

propria underlying affected areas was infiltrated by low to mild numbers of neutrophils

199

and fewer lymphocytes (Figure 2). SARS-CoV-2 antigen and RNA were detected within

200

the epithelium lining the mucosa of rostral and intermediate turbinates. At 4 dpi,

201

epithelial degeneration and necrosis in the rostral and intermediate turbinates were no

202

longer observed, and histologic changes were consistent with mild, multifocal

203

lymphocytic rhinitis with rare clusters of few neutrophils within the lamina propria (Figure

204

2). Nasal passages were clear of exudate. The abundance of SARS-CoV-2 antigen and

205

RNA decreased, and was mostly restricted to rare positive cells in the respiratory

206

epithelium (Figure 2, Table 1 and Table S1). By 7 dpi, the nasal passages (including the

207

ONE) were histologically within normal limits and no SARS-CoV-2 antigen or RNA were

208

detectable in the rostral and intermediate turbinates (Figure S1).

209

The ONE was histologically unremarkable at all timepoints despite the variable amounts

210

of viral antigen and RNA detected during the course of the study. At 2 dpi, multifocal

211

clusters of cells within the ONE contained abundant SARS-CoV-2 antigen and RNA

histologic

changes

were characterized by segmental

212

(Figure 2, Table 1 and Table S1), becoming gradually more rare at 4 and 7 dpi. No

213

SARS-CoV-2 antigen or RNA were detected in the ONE by 14 dpi (Table 1, Table S1,

214

and Figure S1).

215

216

Moderate interstitial pneumonia in K18-hACE2 mice following SARS-CoV-2

217

infection. To evaluate the effects of SARS-CoV-2 infection in the lower respiratory

218

tract of K18-hACE2 mice, we performed similar analysis to that described above. In the

219

lower respiratory tract, histologic alterations in the pulmonary parenchyma mainly

220

involved the alveoli, interstitium and vasculature. Pathologic alterations in the lungs

221

were overall characterized by variable degree of interstitial pneumonia and variable

222

abundance of SARS-CoV-2 antigen and RNA, which were strictly dependent on the

223

experimental timepoint.

224

At 2 dpi, mild perivascular and peribronchiolar inflammation, consisting primarily of

225

lymphocytes and lesser numbers of histiocytes, and occasional perivascular edema

226

were evident (Figure 3). Pulmonary vessels were frequently reactive and lined by a

227

plump endothelium with large numbers of marginating mononuclear leukocytes and few

228

neutrophils (Figure 3). Multifocal to coalescing areas of the pulmonary parenchyma,

229

mostly associated with a bronchopulmonary segment, were composed of alveolar septa

230

mildly expanded by lymphocytes, histiocytes and fewer neutrophils along with scattered

231

air spaces containing low numbers of neutrophils and mild numbers of histiocytes and

232

lymphocytes (Figure 3). SARS-CoV-2 antigen and RNA were multifocally detected

233

within the pulmonary parenchyma, and localized in alveolar type (AT) 1 and fewer AT2

234

pneumocytes predominantly within and adjacent to areas of interstitial pneumonia as

8

235

demonstrated by singleplex and multiplex IHC, and RNAscope® ISH (Figure 3 and

236

Figure S2).

237

At 4 dpi, peak in viral antigen and RNA abundance was reached (correlating with the

238

highest viral RNA load as determined by RT-qPCR) along with a higher number of

239

infiltrating lymphocytes (Figure 3 and Figure S2). SARS-CoV-2 cellular tropism did not

240

differ from that described at 2 dpi.

241

At 7 dpi, there was an increase in the severity of the interstitial pneumonia, which

242

affected up to ~30% of the parenchyma (Figure 3). Multifocal bronchopulmonary

243

segments were composed of alveolar septa expanded by numerous mononuclear cells

244

and fewer neutrophils that extend into the alveolar spaces, occasional septal necrotic

245

debris, and mild proliferation of AT2 cells (Figure 3). In some animals, the affected

246

alveoli were multifocally denuded to completely disrupted by necrosis, and filled with

247

necrotic cell debris and alveolar edema. As for earlier timepoints, mild perivascular and

248

peribronchiolar cuffing of lymphocytes and histiocytes was a common feature. While

249

bronchioles were mostly unaffected, sporadically they were partially lined by an

250

attenuated epithelium and contain rare, individualized mononuclear cells within their

251

lumina. SARS-CoV-2 antigen and RNA were still abundant (Figure 3, Table 1, Figure

252

S2, and Table S1), albeit to a lower extent than at 4 dpi suggesting progressive

253

resolution of viral infection by the host consistent with the RT-qPCR data (Figure 1E).

254

Interestingly, viral antigen was mostly distributed in AT1 and AT2 cells within

255

histologically normal areas of lung adjacent to areas of intense inflammation, while

256

areas of subacute interstitial pneumonia and mild AT2 hyperplasia were characterized

257

by scant to absent SARS-CoV-2 S immunoreactivity (Figure 3, Table 1 and Table S1).

258

Finally, multifocal areas of similar interstitial pneumonia with sporadic aggregates of

259

interstitial lymphocytes and more prominent AT2 hyperplasia were identified in the two

260

male survivors at 14 dpi (Figure 3). No SARS-CoV-2 antigen or RNA was detected at

261

this time point (Figure 3 and Figure S2).

262

Of note, no evidence of SARS-CoV-2 infection in bronchiolar epithelium and pulmonary

263

vasculature was seen at any time during the course of the study (Figure 3, Table 1,

264

Figure S2, and Table S1). Similarly, hyaline membranes, vascular thrombosis, and

265

syncytial cells were not observed at any time point across all animals; which strikingly

266

contrasts with the human patient (Martines et al., 2020) and non-human primate studies

267

(Aid et al., 2020; Blair et al., 2020). Hemorrhage and pulmonary edema were only rarely

268

281

Effective control of SARS-CoV-2 infection in the lower respiratory tract is

282

associated with T-cell and macrophage infiltration. Subsequently, we aimed to

283

further investigate SARS-CoV-2 tropism in the lower respiratory tract of K18-hACE2

284

mice, as well as the dynamics of the host response in this tissue upon infection. We first

285

performed multiplex IHC to probe the localization of SARS-CoV-2 antigen in AT1

286

pneumocytes (cell maker: receptor for advanced glycation end-products [RAGE]), AT2

287

pneumocytes (cell marker: surfactant protein C [SPC]), and endothelial cells (cell

288

marker: CD31). We found that SARS-CoV-2 showed preferential tropism for RAGE+

289

AT1 pneumocytes, as well as scattered SPC+ AT2 pneumocytes, but not for CD31+

290

endothelial cells (Figure 4A).

291

Next, we optimized and applied a 5-plex IHC to characterize the inflammatory response

292

in the lungs of K18-hACE2 mice infected with SARS-CoV-2. At 2 dpi, the affected areas

293

of the pulmonary parenchyma were characterized by abundant viral antigen

294

accompanied by an early host response predominantly mediated by Iba-1+

295

macrophages and low numbers of CD3+CD8- T lymphocytes (presumably CD4+ T

296

lymphocytes, Figure 4C). At 7 dpi, the parenchyma was infiltrated by CD3+CD8+ and

297

CD3+CD8- T lymphocytes and abundant Iba-1+ macrophages with a reduction in the

298

number of SARS-CoV-2-infected cells, the latter mostly restricted to areas of the

299

parenchyma with less intense inflammatory response (Figure 4D). At 14 dpi, the

300

inflammatory response was characterized by multifocal interstitial aggregates of CD19+

301

B lymphocytes, abundant Iba-1+ macrophages, moderate numbers of CD3+CD8- T

302

lymphocytes, (scattered throughout the interstitium as well as associated with CD19+ B

303

lymphocyte aggregates) and a reduction in the number of infiltrating CD3+CD8+ T

304

lymphocytes with undetectable SARS-CoV-2 antigen (Figure 4E). Altogether, our data

305

showed that control of SARS-CoV-2 in the lung of K18-hACE2 mice is associated with

306

moderate interstitial pneumonia characterized by a strong local lymphocytic and

307

histiocytic host response. Effective immune control and moderate inflammation once

308

again suggest that lethality observed in K18-hACE2 mice is attributable to lung-

309

independent disease.

310

Severe SARS-CoV-2 neuroinvasion and neurological damage in K18-hACE2 mice.

311

Pursuing our hypothesis that the lethality of the K18-hACE2 mice is associated with

312

brain neuroinvasion, we analyzed sagittal sections of the brain including representation

313

of the cribriform plate and olfactory bulb at different timepoints post-infection (2, 4, 6-7

314

and 14 dpi) for histologic changes and viral antigen distribution (Figures 5 and 6).

315

Histologic alterations in the brain were first observed as early as 6 dpi but mostly at 7

316

dpi, and consisted of mild, multifocal neuronal spongiosis primarily throughout the

317

cerebral cortical layers of the somatomotor, somatosensory and visual areas (Figure 5).

318

Additionally, multifocal blood vessels were delimited by delicate cuffs of few

319

lymphocytes with mild numbers of reactive glial cells in the adjacent neuroparenchyma.

320

At 7 dpi, histologic alterations worsened in severity and became more widespread with

321

involvement of the olfactory bulb, cerebral cortex (most predominantly somatosensory

322

and somatomotor areas), hippocampus (mainly CA1 region), brainstem (thalamus),

323

midbrain and the dentate nucleus ventral to the cerebellum (Figure 5). At the level of the

324

olfactory bulb, the glomerular, external plexiform, and mitral cell layers were

325

characterized by moderate to marked neuropil vacuolization (spongiosis) with

326

occasional vacuoles containing intralesional cell debris. Elsewhere, the grey and white

12

327

matter within affected areas of the neuroparenchyma were extensively and

328

predominantly characterized by marked spongiosis with frequent clear vacuoles

329

containing intralesional cell debris, and multifocal shrunken, angular, hypereosinophilic

330

and pyknotic neuronal bodies with loss of Nissl substance/chromatolysis (neuronal

331

degeneration and necrosis, Figure 5) and occasionally delimited by multiple glial cells

332

(satellitosis). There were multifocal, delicate perivascular cuffs composed of

333

lymphocytes and the adjacent neuroparenchyma had an increase in the number of

334

reactive glial cells (gliosis). Notably, the cerebellum (cortical layers and associated white

335

matter of the cerebellar folia) was spared of histologic changes.

336

Neuronal changes correlated with abundant neuronal immunoreactivity for SARS-CoV-2

337

S antigen and viral RNA, with exclusive localization within the perikaryon and neuronal

338

processes (Figure 6). SARS-CoV-2 antigen and RNA had a widespread distribution

339

throughout the brain in roughly 85% (11/13) of infected K18-hACE2 mice at 7 dpi,

340

including neuronal bodies within the cerebral cortex, CA1, CA2 and CA3 regions of the

341

hippocampus, anterior olfactory nucleus, caudoputamen, nucleus accumbens, thalamic

342

nuclei including hypothalamus, midbrain, pons and medulla oblongata nuclei (Figure 6).

343

Few vestibulocochlear nerve fascicles showed immunoreactivity for viral antigen; while

344

no viral S antigen or RNA was detected in areas spared of histological changes

345

including the cerebellar cortex and white matter, optic nerve and retina, and the spiral

346

ganglion of the inner ear (albeit the eye and inner ear were not present in the majority of

347

sections examined). SARS-CoV-2 S antigen and RNA preceded histological findings

348

with rare viral antigen and RNA detected as early as 4 dpi in mitral and inner nuclear

349

neurons of the olfactory bulb, as well as small clusters of neurons within the anterior

350

olfactory nucleus and orbital area of the cerebral cortex (Figure 6).

351

Multiplex IHC for co-detection of SARS-CoV-2 antigen, Iba-1+ and GFAP+ glial cells

352

was performed at 7 dpi, timepoint at which widespread viral antigen and RNA along with

353

histological lesions were observed. Multiple IHC revealed that the gliosis in the brain of

354

infected mice was attributed to abundant GFAP+ astrocytes as well as Iba-1+ microglial

355

cells, which did not colocalize with SARS-CoV-2 S protein expression (Figure 7). Iba-1+

356

microglial cells with broad cytoplasmic ramifications were seen to be tightly associated

357

with SARS-CoV-2+ neuronal bodies, suggestive of an active host response against

358

infection (Figure 7).

359

We evaluated the extent of the CNS involvement in infected K18-hACE2 mice at 7 dpi

360

by additionally examining the cervicothoracic and lumbosacral segments of the spinal

361

cord. In 9/11 infected K18-hACE2 mice that showed widespread viral antigen in the

362

brain, the spinal cord also had mild-to-moderate viral antigen that predominated within

363

the cervicothoracic segments (Figure S3, Table 1 and Table S1). Neuronal changes

364

were similar to those noted in affected areas of the brain; however, gliosis and

365

perivascular cuffing were sparse.

366

Finally, Luxol Fast Blue was utilized to assess myelin loss (demyelination) following

367

SARS-CoV-2 invasion in the brain and spinal cord at 7 dpi. No evidence of

368

demyelination was noted.

369

Taken together, our data show that SARS-CoV-2 infection of K18-hACE2 results in

370

severe neuronal invasion of the CNS, likely via retrograde transport through the

14

371

olfactory bulb originating from axonal

processes traversing the ONE. Viral

372

neuroinvasion resulted in extensive cytopathic effect in neurons, comprising not only the

373

brain but also the spinal cord.

374

375

ACE2 expression and distribution does not fully reflect SARS-CoV-2 tissue

376

tropism in K18-hACE2 mice. To further explore the mechanism driving lethal SARS-

377

CoV-2 infection in K18-hACE2 mice, we first investigated the tissue and cellular

378

distribution of the ACE2 receptor in both C57BL/6J and K18-hACE2 mice by IHC using

379

a cross-reactive anti-ACE2 antibody (cross-reactive to hACE2 and mACE2) (Table S2).

380

In the lower respiratory tract (lungs), ACE2 was ubiquitously expressed along the apical

381

membrane of bronchiolar epithelium and, less commonly, in rare and scattered AT2

382

pneumocytes (Figure 8). No ACE2 expression was found in AT1 pneumocytes.

383

Strikingly, no differences in the distribution and abundance of ACE2 expression were

384

identified between uninfected C57BL/6J, sham-inoculated K18-hACE2, and terminal (7

385

dpi) K18-hACE2 mice inoculated with SARS-CoV-2 (Figure 8).

386

We therefore aimed at analyzing expression and distribution of hACE2 mRNA using

387

RNAscope® ISH. Although no expression of hACE2 mRNA was detected in the lungs of

388

non-transgenic C57BL/6J mice (Figure 9), expression of hACE2 mRNA was detectable

389

but low in the lungs of K18-hACE2 mice, and mostly involved bronchiolar epithelial cells

390

with sporadic expression within few pneumocytes (Figure 9). In summary, these findings

391

indicate that hACE2 expression in the lungs of K18-hACE2 is low, and that expression

392

of hACE2 is not the sole host factor determinant of susceptibility to SARS-CoV-2. This

393

is clearly exemplified by the following: 1) certain cell types that, while expressing

15

bioRxiv preprint doi: https://doi.org/10.1101/2021.01.13.425144; this version posted January 15, 2021. The copyright holder for this preprint

394

hACE2, were non-permissive to SARS-CoV-2 infection throughout the experiment (i.e.

395

bronchiolar epithelial cells); and 2) the near diffuse infection of AT1 cells by 4 dpi

396

despite sparse to absent expression of hACE2 in these cells. These observations

397

support evidence for an ACE2-independent viral entry mechanism playing a major role

398

in the pulmonary dissemination of K18-hACE2 mice.

399

In contrast to the lung, increased ACE2 expression was clearly evident in the nasal

400

cavity of K18-hACE2 mice compared to C57BL/6J mice. We assessed ACE2

401

expression on the rostral nasal epithelium, respiratory epithelium at the level of the

402

intermediate turbinates (Figure 8) as well as in the ONE and olfactory bulb (Figure 8).

403

Unlike C57BL/6J mice, in which ACE2 was undetectable within the nasal cavity, ACE2

404

was diffusely expressed within the apical membrane of transitional and respiratory

405

epithelium, and segmentally within the apical surface of the ONE in both sham-

406

inoculated and SARS-CoV-2-infected K18-hACE mice (Figure 8). While minimal to rare

407

expression of hACE2 mRNA was identified in the neurons of the mitral layer of the

408

olfactory bulb, olfactory neuroepithelium and respiratory epithelium of rostral turbinates,

409

estimation of its abundance and distribution could not be fully assessed since the

410

decalcification procedure had a significant impact in the quality of cellular mRNA as

411

demonstrated by the low detection of the housekeeping mRNA, Ppib (data not shown).

412

In the brain of both C57BL/6J and K18-hACE2 mice, ACE2 immunoreactivity was

413

observed in the vascular endothelium lining blood vessels (Figure 8), as well as

414

ependymal and choroid plexus epithelium. In contrast, distribution of hACE2 mRNA

415

expression involved clusters of neurons within the cerebral cortex, hippocampus,

416

midbrain, brainstem and Purkinje cells from the cerebellum, with no expression noted in

16

417

non-transgenic C57BL/6J mice (Figure 10 and Figure S4). There was no expression of

418

hACE2 mRNA in vascular endothelial cells. Taken together, our data show a

419

discrepancy between ACE2 protein and RNA expression and distribution within the

420

CNS. This is partly attributable to the fact that the ACE2 antibody we utilized cross

421

reacts with both hACE2 and mACE2, while the ACE2 probe employed was human

422

specific.

423

immunoreactivity in the capillary endothelium supports the notion that ACE2 expression

424

in these cells is of murine origin. The absence of ACE2 immunoreactivity in neurons is

425

suggestive of a potential restriction in the translation (or post-translation) of the ACE2

426

receptor in these cells. This, in addition to the fact that Purkinje cells of the cerebellum

427

are non-permissive to SARS-CoV-2 infection in spite of the expression of hACE2

428

mRNA, also suggests that ACE2 is likely not the sole host factor associated with

429

neuroinvasion and that other ACE2-independent entry mechanisms contribute to

430

neuroinvasion and spread by SARS-CoV-2 in this murine model.

DISCUSSION

444

The K18-hACE2 transgenic mouse model has become a widespread laboratory animal

445

model suitable for studying SARS-CoV-2 pathogenesis as well as medical

446

countermeasures against COVID-19 (Johansen et al., 2020). The suitability of this

447

model relies on the common host entry receptor shared between SARS-CoV-1 and

448

SARS-CoV-2 (Hoffmann et al., 2020; Li et al., 2003), and transgenic mice expressing

449

hACE2 under the K18 promoter develop lethal clinical disease associated with

450

pulmonary pathology and neuroinvasion, with high viral titers (Golden et al., 2020;

451

McCray et al., 2007; Moreau et al., 2020; Oladunni et al., 2020; Rathnasinghe et al.,

452

2020; Winkler et al., 2020; Yinda et al., 2020; Zheng et al., 2020). In contrast, other

453

murine models of SARS-CoV-2 (e.g. adenovirus-transduced hACE2 mice and

454

transgenic mice expressing hACE2 under the HFH4 promoter) develop only mild

455

disease with limited and short-lived viral replication and pulmonary pathology, and low

456

to no lethality (Jiang et al., 2020; Rathnasinghe et al., 2020). While the K18-hACE2

457

murine model has been critical in shedding light on mechanisms of lung injury and

458

dysfunction, it fails to faithfully recapitulate several key histologic features of severe and

459

lethal cases of COVID-19 in humans, such as diffuse alveolar damage (DAD) with

460

hyaline membrane formation and multi-organ failure associated with hypercoagulability

461

and widespread microthrombi formation (Maiese et al., 2020; Martines et al., 2020).

462

In order to better understand the pathogenesis of SARS-CoV-2, well-characterized

463

animal models are critically needed (Munoz-Fontela et al., 2020). Even though the K18-

464

hACE2 murine model is currently under extensive use, several aspects associated with

465

the temporospatial dynamics of SARS-CoV-2 infection remain poorly characterized,

466

including the expression and cellular distribution of hACE2. We attempted to further

467

characterize pathological aspects related to viral pathogenesis in this unique murine

468

model, and hypothesized that the temporospatial distribution of SARS-CoV-2 and

469

pathological outcomes following infection in the K18-hACE2 murine model is partially

470

but not solely associated with hACE2 and that increased lethality in this model is related

471

to neuroinvasion. The study presented herein provides additional novel information

472

regarding the temporal and spatial aspects of SARS-CoV-2 infection in the K18-hACE2

473

mouse model with emphasis on pathological outcomes as well as a thorough and

474

methodical characterization of ACE2 expression in this transgenic mouse model, which

475

contributes to our understanding of this critical model used for preclinical evaluation of

476

vaccines and antiviral therapeutics. The results presented herein not only demonstrate

477

that lethality of this murine model is associated with neuroinvasion and subsequent

478

neuronal cytopathic effect, but that SARS-CoV-2 tropism is not solely restricted to

479

ACE2-expressing cells in K18-hACE2 mice. Thus, the neuropathogenic potential of

480

SARS-CoV-2 is dependent on other host factors.

481

In this study, we have utilized a large cohort of K18-hACE2 mice (n=50) in order to

482

sequentially evaluate SARS-CoV-2 tropism and pathological alterations, spatial and

483

temporal analysis of host factors including inflammatory response and ACE2/hACE2

484

expression, and survival curve analysis for a period of 14 dpi. Similarly to previous

19

bioRxiv preprint doi: https://doi.org/10.1101/2021.01.13.425144; this version posted January 15, 2021. The copyright holder for this preprint

485

studies, which only observed the outcome of SARS-CoV-2 for up to 7 dpi (Golden et al.,

486

2020; Moreau et al., 2020; Oladunni et al., 2020; Rathnasinghe et al., 2020; Winkler et

487

al., 2020), infected K18-hACE2 mice initially developed significant clinical disease with

488

marked weight loss and increased respiratory effort associated with the development of

489

interstitial pneumonia and high viral load as determined via IHC, ISH and RT-qPCR; an

490

unquestionable feature of this model. Survival curve analysis clearly demonstrated that

491

lethality in infected mice only occurs after 6 dpi and in the vast majority of mice (96.3%),

492

coincided with the initiation of neurologic signs and/or symptoms, neuronal cytopathic

493

effect, and abundance of viral S antigen and RNA in the CNS. These observations are a

494

clear indication of the rapid and fatal neuroinvasive nature of this model. Our study also

495

demonstrates that SARS-CoV-2 has a tropism for motor neurons within the spinal cord

496

(predominantly within the cervicothoracic segments), which was only observed in mice

497

with concurrent brain involvement suggesting a descending infection. This finding helps

498

rationalize the neurologic signs observed with this model including decreased

499

mobility/responsiveness and decreased urine voiding that was evident at necropsy,

500

reflective of severe urinary bladder dilation and accumulation of concentrated urine.

501

Given the spinal cord involvement, the latter is likely attributed to altered spinal reflexes

502

and/or decreased intervention of the detrusor muscle, which is required for normal

503

micturation. An additional striking clinical feature in infected K18-hACE2 mice at 7 dpi

504

was hypothermia (mean body temperature of 30.6 °C), which is likely a consequence of

505

hypothalamic and motor neuron dysfunction associated with SARS-CoV-2 neurotropism

506

and could serve as a clinical indicator of CNS involvement. Our results unequivocally

507

demonstrate that neuroinvasion represents the driving component of fatality in this

20

508

animal model compared to others such as Syrian hamsters, which display more severe

509

pulmonary disease and infection of the ONE, but no evidence of neuroinvasion (Bryche

510

et al., 2020). Furthermore, these animals invariably recover within 14 days following

511

intranasal infection with SARS-CoV-2 (Bryche et al., 2020; Imai et al., 2020; Osterrieder

512

et al., 2020; Rosenke et al., 2020; Sia et al., 2020). Very few infected K18-hACE2 mice

513

(2/30) from our cohort survived until the end of the study (14 dpi) and, while ameliorated

514

pulmonary lesions were noticed in these, they did not exhibit involvement of the CNS

515

further supporting the observation that mice suffering from SARS-CoV-2 neuroinvasion

516

invariably succumb at earlier time points post-infection. Both of these survivor mice

517

developed pulmonary interstitial aggregates of B lymphocytes that were distinct from

518

earlier time points, which could be suggestive of the development of protective adaptive

519

immunity. The normal histologic appearance of the CNS in surviving mice and lack of

520

any residual neurologic signs supports the notion that animals can fully recover from

521

infection, albeit we acknowledge that limited neuroinvasion in these animals could not

522

be disproven. Furthermore, we acknowledge that extensive neurobehavior testing,

523

which is beyond the expertise of the authors, would be required to rule out any long-

524

term sequelae in the rare instance of survivors. Overall, these findings are of

525

importance to researchers with a particular interest in studying SARS-CoV-2-associated

526

neuropathogenesis, as premature euthanasia due to other clinical features (i.e., weight

527

loss, ruffled fur, and/or respiratory distress) have the potential to precede CNS disease

528

and such terminal endpoints, if elected, may preclude evaluation of the effects of SARS-

529

CoV-2 in the CNS. Instead decreased responsiveness/mobility and tremors are

530

interpreted to reflect better clinical findings supportive of neuroinvasive disease.

531

To date, the precise mechanism(s) enabling neuroinvasion in the K18-hACE2 model is

532

poorly understood (Bryche et al., 2020; DosSantos et al., 2020; Ellul et al., 2020; Liu et

533

al., 2020; Solomon et al., 2020). Here, we determined that K18-hACE2 transgenic mice

534

show a significant upregulation in the expression of ACE2 in the nasal cavity

535

(particularly in the neuroepithelium) compared to wild-type C57BL/6J mice, in which

536

ACE2 expression is undetectable by IHC. This difference between K18-hACE2 and

537

C57BL/6J mice is clearly attributed to the expression of the hACE2 transgene, and is a

538

key feature to the neuropathogenesis of this model. Interestingly, temporal analysis of

539

SARS-CoV-2 S antigen and RNA in the ONE of transgenic mice preceded and/or

540

occurred simultaneously with infection of neurons within the glomerular and mitral layers

541

of the olfactory bulb, indicative of possible viral retrograde transport through axonal

542

processes traversing the cribriform plate and allowing viral spread within cortical

543

neurons and beyond. Expression of hACE2 within neurons in the CNS is overall low and

544

does not correlate with our immunohistochemical findings, where ACE2 protein was

545

restricted to capillary endothelium, ependymal and choroid epithelium with sparing of

546

neurons and their processes. These findings suggest the ACE2 expression in these

547

anatomical compartments could be attributed to mACE2 or indicative of a post-

548

transcriptional event that could be limiting neuronal expression of hACE2. These along

549

with the fact that hACE2 mRNA is not abundantly and equally expressed among

550

different neuronal populations and that Purkinje cells in the cerebellum express hACE2

551

mRNA, but are not permissive to SARS-CoV-2 infection, suggest that entry of SARS-

552

CoV-2 into neurons is likely mediated by other host receptors independent of ACE2.

Infection of brain organoids has been shown to be inhibited by the use of anti-ACE2

554

antibodies (Song et al., 2020). However, brain organoids do not recapitulate the

555

complexity of the entire CNS, and retrograde transport of viral particles into the CNS

556

can hardly be modeled in vitro. Altogether, this suggests that while ACE2 is assuredly

557

an important mediator of CNS neuroinvasion, in vitro platforms to study mechanisms of

558

SARS-CoV-2 neuroinvasion are limiting, and require the use of more complex

559

experimental systems. Recently, neuropilin-1, a transmembrane glycoprotein serving as

560

cell surface receptor for semaphorins and other ligands, was shown to serve as an

561

alternative receptor for SARS-CoV-2 mediating entry into the neuroepithelium and

562

neurons (Cantuti-Castelvetri et al., 2020). Even though we analyzed the expression of

563

neuropilin-1 in this study (data not shown), we observed ubiquitous expression in the

564

nasal passages, brain, kidneys, liver and lungs, precluding any definitive conclusions in

565

support or against these claims (Cantuti-Castelvetri et al., 2020).

566

Anosmia and ageusia (loss of smell and taste, respectively) represent the earliest and

567

most common but transient neurologic symptoms in people with COVID-19, being

568

reported in ≥ 50% of cases (Eliezer et al., 2020; Ellul et al., 2020; Walker et al., 2020).

569

Hyposmia or anosmia has also been clearly characterized in K18-hACE2 mice,

570

occurring between 2-3 dpi, which was characterized through a series of unique

571

behavioral tests requiring a normal sense of smell (Zheng et al., 2020). Other neurologic

572

manifestations of COVID-19 are associated with acute cerebrovascular disease, with

573

cohort studies reporting strokes in 2–6% of hospitalized patients (Ellul et al., 2020;

574

Wang et al., 2020b). Long-term neurologic sequelae associated with COVID-19 or its

575

effect on neurodegenerative diseases remain unclear (Wang et al., 2020b). Very little is

577

directly or indirectly associated with SARS-CoV-2.

578

described in humans both in health and with chronic rhinosinusitis, with expression

579

noted in sustentacular cells of the ONE, but not within immature and mature olfactory

580

neurons (Chen et al., 2020). This observation led the authors to suggest that anosmia in

581

COVID-19 is likely attributable to an indirect effect of SARS-CoV-2 infection. However,

582

recent studies evaluated brain and nasal autopsies from patients who died of COVID-

583

19, in which SARS-CoV-2 antigen and RNA was detected in cells of neural origin within

584

the ONE and cortical neurons occasionally associated with locally ischemic regions

585

(Meinhardt et al., 2020; Song et al., 2020). These studies provide conclusive evidence

586

that the K18-hACE2 mice serves as a model with translational significance, even though

587

ischemic lesions have not been reported including those in our study, further justifying

588

its use to dissect the intricate mechanisms involved in SARS-CoV-2-mediated CNS

589

invasion.

590

neuroepithelium of Syrian hamsters (Bryche et al., 2020), the K18-hACE2 and a

591

CRISPR/Cas9 hACE2 knock-in mouse model (Sun et al., 2020) are the only models

592

that develop neuroinvasion with wild-type virus and, thus, will be particularly useful for

593

studying SARS-CoV-2 neuropathogenesis, particularly the mechanisms of viral

594

trafficking of into the CNS through the neuroepithelium.

595

Another important observation of the K18-hACE2 model is that SARS-CoV-2 tropism

596

extensively involves infection of ACE2 and hACE2 negative cells, including certain

597

population of neurons and the vast majority of AT1 pneumocytes. Similarly, sole

602

ACE2-independent entry.

603

In conclusion, this study provides a comprehensive spatiotemporal analysis of SARS-

604

CoV-2 infection in the K18-hACE2 transgenic murine model along with an analysis of

605

the contribution of ACE2 in the permissiveness of the model. Our work provides

606

evidence that SARS-CoV-2 exhibits a marked neurotropism, and that this process likely

607

occurs through mechanisms that are in part hACE2-independent. Lethal CNS invasion,

608

combined with the absence of several of the pulmonary hallmarks associated with

609

severe human COVID-19, therefore calls for attentive caution when utilizing the K18-

610

hACE2 mouse model to investigate certain aspects of SARS-CoV-2 pathogenesis. The

611

protective ability of anti-viral therapies and T-cell based vaccines against lethal

612

challenge in this model might indeed be then underestimated due to the increased

613

susceptibility to CNS invasion. Regardless, the K18-hACE2 mouse model represents a

614

promising model

615

neuroinvasion, ACE2-independent virus entry, and evaluating potent and fast-acting

616

prophylactic countermeasures.

to study initiation. Work with SARS-CoV-2 was performed in a biosafety level-3

622

laboratory by personnel equipped with powered air-purifying respirators.

623

Cells and viruses. African green monkey kidney Vero E6 cells (ATCC® CRL-1586™,

624

American Type Culture Collection, Manassas, VA) were maintained in Dulbecco’s

625

minimum essential medium (DMEM; Gibco, Carlsbad, CA [#11995-065]) containing

626

10% fetal bovine serum (FBS, ThermoFisher Scientific, Waltham, MA), 1X non-essential

627

amino acids (ThermoFisher Scientific), penicillin and streptomycin (100 U/ml and 100

628

629

°C and 5% CO2 in a humidified incubator.

630

SARS-CoV-2 isolate stock preparation and titration. All replication-competent

631

SARS-CoV-2 experiments were performed in a biosafety level 3 laboratory (BSL-3) at

632

the Boston University’ National Emerging Infectious Diseases Laboratories. 2019-

633

nCoV/USA-WA1/2020 isolate (NCBI accession number: MN985325) of SARS-CoV-2

634

was obtained from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (Atlanta, GA) and

635

BEI Resources (Manassas, VA). To generate the passage 1 (P1) virus stock, Vero E6

636

cells, pre-seeded the day before at a density of 10 million cells, were infected in T175

637

flasks with the master stock, diluted in 10 ml final volume of Opti-MEM (ThermoFisher

638

Scientific). Following virus adsorption to the cells at 37 ºC for 1 h, 15 ml DMEM

639

containing 10% FBS and 1X penicillin/streptomycin was added to the flask. The next

640

day, media was removed, the cell monolayer was rinsed with 1X phosphate buffered

641

saline (PBS) pH 7.5 (ThermoFisher Scientific) and 25 ml of fresh DMEM containing 2%

642

FBS was added. Two days later, when the cytopathic effect of the virus was clearly

643

visible, culture medium was collected, filtered through a 0.2 µm filter, and stored at -80

644

ºC. Our P2 working stock of the virus was prepared by infecting Vero E6 cells with the

645

P1 stock, at a multiplicity of infection (MOI) of 0.1. Cell culture media was harvested at 2

646

and 3 dpi, and after the last harvest, ultracentrifuged (Beckman Coulter Optima L-100k;

647

SW32 Ti rotor) for 2 h at 25,000 rpm (80,000 X g) over a 20% sucrose cushion (Sigma-

648

Aldrich, St. Louis, MO). Following centrifugation, the media and sucrose were discarded

649

and pellets were left to dry for 5 minutes at room temperature. Pellets were then

650

resuspended overnight at 4 ºC in 500 µl of 1X PBS. The next day, concentrated virions

651

were aliquoted at stored at -80 ºC.

652

The titer of our viral stock was determined by plaque assay. Vero E6 cells were seeded

653

into a 12-well plate at a density of 2.5 x 105 cells per well and infected the next day with

654

serial 10-fold dilutions of the virus stock for 1 h at 37 ºC. Following virus adsorption, 1 ml

655

of overlay media, consisting of 2X DMEM supplemented with 4% FBS and mixed at a

656

1:1 ratio with 1.2% Avicel (DuPont; RC-581), was added in each well. Three days later,

657

the overlay medium was removed, the cell monolayer was washed with 1X PBS and

658

fixed for 30 minutes at room temperature with 4% paraformaldehyde (Sigma-Aldrich).

659

Fixed cells were then washed with 1X PBS and stained for 1h at room temperature with

660

0.1% crystal violet (Sigma-Aldrich) prepared in 10% ethanol/water. After rinsing with tap

661

water, the number of plaques were counted and the virus titer was calculated. The titer

662

of our P2 virus stock was 4 x 108 plaque forming units (PFU)/ml.

cycle at 30-70% humidity and provided ad-libitum water and standard chow diets

671

(LabDiet, St. Louis, MO).

672

Intranasal inoculation with SARS-CoV-2. At 4 months of age, K18-hACE2 mice of

673

both sexes were intranasally inoculated with 1 x 106PFU of SARS-CoV-2 in 50 µl of

674

sterile 1X PBS (n=47 [n=25 male and n=12 female), or sham inoculated with 50 µl of

675

sterile 1X PBS (n=3; female). Inoculations were performed under 1-3% isoflurane

676

anesthesia. Animals were either enrolled in a 14-day survival curve study (n=33).

677

Animals were only euthanized early if they reached euthanasia criteria, or if the

678

experiment included predetermined euthanasia timepoints for tissue sampling (2, 4, or 7

679

dpi; n=15).

Information Devices, Lake Villa, IL, USA) 48-72 hours prior to inoculation. An IACUC-

683

approved clinical scoring system was utilized to monitor disease progression and

684

establish humane endpoints (Table 2). Categories evaluated included body weight,

685

general appearance, responsiveness, respiration, and neurological signs for a

691

Tissue processing and viral RNA isolation. Tissues were collected from mice and

692

stored in 600 µl of RNAlater (Sigma-Aldrich; # R0901500ML) and stored at -80 °C. For

693

processing, 20 – 30 mg of tissue were placed into a 2 ml tube with 600 µl of RLT buffer

694

with 1% β-mercaptoethanol and a 5 mm stainless steel bead (Qiagen, Valencia, CA;

695

#69989). Tissues were then dissociated using a Qiagen TissueLyser II (Qiagen) with

696

the following cycle parameters: 20 cycles/s for 2 min, 1 min wait, 20 cycles/s for 2 min.

697

Samples were centrifuged at 17,000 X g (13,000 rpm) for 10 minutes and supernatant

698

was transferred to a new 1.5 ml tube. Viral RNA isolation was performed using a Qiagen

699

RNeasy Plus Mini Kit (Qiagen; #74134), according to the manufacturer’s instructions,

700

with an additional on-column DNase treatment (Qiagen; #79256). RNA was finally

701

eluted in 30 μl of RNase/DNase-free water and stored at -80 °C until used.
