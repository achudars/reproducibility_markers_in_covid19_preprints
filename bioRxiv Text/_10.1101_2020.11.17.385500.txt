The recurrent zoonotic spillover of coronaviruses (CoVs) into the human population

32

underscores the need for broadly active countermeasures. Here, we employed a directed

33

evolution approach to engineer three SARS-CoV-2 antibodies for enhanced neutralization

34

breadth and potency. One of the affinity-matured variants, ADG-2, displays strong binding

35

activity to a large panel of sarbecovirus receptor binding domains (RBDs) and neutralizes

36

representative epidemic sarbecoviruses with remarkable potency. Structural and

37

biochemical studies demonstrate that ADG-2 employs a unique angle of approach to

38

recognize a highly conserved epitope overlapping the receptor binding site. In murine

models of SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 infection, passive transfer of ADG-2 provided

complete protection against respiratory burden, viral replication in the lungs, and lung

41

pathology. Altogether, ADG-2 represents a promising broad-spectrum therapeutic

42

candidate for the treatment and prevention of SARS-CoV-2 and future emerging SARS-

43

like CoVs.

44

Over the past two decades, three pathogenic CoVs have emerged from zoonotic

45

reservoirs to cause outbreaks of deadly pneumonia in humans: severe acute respiratory syndrome

46

coronavirus (SARS-CoV), Middle-East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV), and

47

severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) (1). SARS-CoV emerged in

48

2002 in the Guangdong province of China and infected ~8000 people with a case fatality rate of

49

~10% before being contained by public health measures (2). MERS-CoV emerged in the human

50

population in 2012 and is still a significant public health threat in the Middle East (3, 4). In late

51

2019, SARS-CoV-2 emerged in the city of Wuhan in China’s Hubei province and rapidly caused

52

an ongoing pandemic that has resulted in over a million deaths while disrupting the global

53

economy (1, 5). Currently, there are no approved vaccines to prevent SARS-CoV-2 infection and

54

only one antiviral drug has been approved to treat SARS-CoV-2 associated disease (i.e. COVID-

55

19). Furthermore, the recurrent zoonotic spillover of CoVs into the human population, along with

56

the broad diversity of SARS-like CoVs circulating in animal reservoirs (6), suggests that novel

57

pathogenic CoVs are likely to emerge in the future and underscores the need for broadly active

58

countermeasures.

59

Similar to other CoVs, the SARS-CoV-2 spike (S) protein mediates viral entry and is the

60

only known target for neutralizing antibodies (nAbs). The S glycoprotein consists of two

61

functional subunits, S1 and S2, that mediate receptor binding and viral fusion, respectively.

62

Previous studies have shown that the vast majority of potent neutralizing antibodies induced by

63

natural CoV infection target the RBD on the S1 subunit (7-10). Although SARS-CoV and

64

SARS-CoV-2 both belong to the sarbecovirus subgenus and their S glycoproteins share 76%

65

amino acid identity, only a handful of cross-neutralizing antibodies have been described to date

66

(11-13). These rare broadly neutralizing antibodies (bnAbs) represent an attractive opportunity

67

for therapeutic drug stockpiling to prevent or mitigate future outbreaks of SARS-related CoVs,

68

but their limited neutralization potency may translate into suboptimal protective efficacy or

69

impractical dosing regimens. Here, we show that such bnAbs can be engineered for improved

70

neutralization potency while retaining neutralization breadth, and we demonstrate that these

71

bnAbs can provide broad protection in vivo.

72

We recently isolated several antibodies from the memory B cells of a 2003 SARS

73

survivor that cross-neutralize multiple SARS-related viruses with relatively modest potency (11).

74

Although breadth and potency are often opposing characteristics, we sought to engineer these

75

bnAbs for improved neutralization potency against SARS-CoV-2, while also maintaining or

76

improving neutralization breadth and potency against other SARS-related viruses. Because

77

binding affinity and neutralization potency are generally well-correlated (14), we employed

78

yeast-surface display technology to improve the binding affinities of three of the bnAbs (ADI-

79

55688, ADI-55689, and ADI-56046) for a prefusion-stabilized SARS-CoV-2 S protein (11, 15-

80

17).

81

Yeast display libraries were generated by introducing diversity into the heavy (HC)- and

82

light-chain (LC) variable genes of ADI-55688, ADI-55689, and ADI-56046 through

83

oligonucleotide-based mutagenesis and transformation into Saccharomyces cerevisiae by

84

homologous recombination (15). Following four rounds of selection with a recombinant SARS-

85

CoV-2 S1 protein, improved binding populations were sorted, and between 20 and 50 unique

86

clones from each lineage were screened for binding to SARS-CoV-2 S (17) (Fig. 1A, B and Fig.

87

S1). The highest affinity binders from each of the three lineages bound to the SARS-CoV-2 S

88

protein with monovalent equilibrium dissociation constants (KDs) in the picomolar range,

89

representing 25 to 630-fold improvements in binding relative to their respective parental clones

90

(Fig. 1B and Fig. S2). To determine whether the improvements in SARS-CoV-2 S binding

91

affinity translated into enhanced neutralization potency, we selected between 9 and 14 affinity-

92

matured progeny from each lineage, and evaluated them for SARS-CoV-2 neutralizing activity

93

in a murine leukemia virus (MLV) pseudovirus assay (18). We also measured the neutralizing

94

activities of several clinical-stage neutralizing antibodies (nAbs) (S309, REGN10933,

95

REGN10987, and CB6/LY-CoV016) as benchmarks (12, 19, 20). All of the affinity-matured

96

antibodies showed improved neutralizing activity relative to their parental clones, and the most

97

potent neutralizers from each lineage (ADG-1, ADG-2, and ADG-3) displayed neutralization

98

IC50s that were comparable to or lower than those observed for the clinical SARS-CoV-2 nAb

99

controls (Fig. 1B).

100

Because in vitro engineering can lead to polyspecificity with potential risks of off-target

101

binding and accelerated clearance in vivo (21), we assessed the polyspecificity of ADG-1, ADG-

102

2, and ADG-3 using a previously described assay that has been shown to be predictive of serum

103

half-life in humans (22). All three antibodies lacked polyreactivity in this assay, indicating a low

104

risk for poor pharmacokinetic behavior (Fig. S3). The three antibodies also showed low

105

hydrophobicity, a low propensity for self-interaction, and thermal stabilities within the range

106

observed for clinically approved antibodies (Fig. S3). In summary, the process of in vitro

107

engineering did not negatively impact biophysical properties that are often linked to down-

108

stream behaviors such as serum half-life, ease of manufacturing, ability to formulate to high

109

concentrations, and long-term stability.

110

To determine whether the process of SARS-CoV-2 affinity engineering impacted

111

neutralization breadth, we evaluated ADG-1, ADG-2, and ADG-3, as well as their respective

112

parental antibodies, for neutralizing activity against a panel of representative authentic clade I

113

sarbecoviruses (SARS-CoV, SHC014, SARS-CoV-2, and WIV-1). Consistent with the MLV-

114

SARS-CoV-2 assay results, ADG-2 displayed highly potent neutralizing activity against

115

authentic SARS-CoV-2, with an IC50 comparable to or lower than that observed for the

116

benchmark SARS-CoV-2 nAbs (Fig. 1C and Fig. S4). Furthermore, in contrast to the benchmark

117

nAbs, ADG-2 displayed high neutralization potency against SARS-CoV and the two SARS-

118

related bat viruses, with IC50s between 4 and 8 ng/mL (Fig. 1C and Fig. S4). ADG-3 and the

119

clinical nAb S309 also cross-neutralized all four sarbecoviruses, but with markedly lower

120

potency than ADG-2. Finally, ADG-1 potently neutralized SARS-CoV-2, SARS-CoV, and

121

WIV1, but it lacked activity against SHC014.

122

Based on its potent cross-neutralization and favorable biophysical properties, we selected

123

ADG-2 as a lead therapeutic candidate and confirmed its potent neutralizing activity in two

124

alternative authentic SARS-CoV-2 neutralization assays (IC50 ~1 ng/mL) (Fig. 1C, D and Fig.

125

S4). Interestingly, ADG-2, CB6/LY-CoV016, REGN10987 and REGN10933 reached 100%

126

neutralization on both Vero and HeLa-hACE2 target cells in this assay, whereas S309 showed

127

complete neutralization on Vero target cells but plateaued at approximately 40% neutralization

128

on HeLa-hACE2 target cells (Fig. 1D). S309 also failed to neutralize MLV-SARS-CoV-2 on

129

HeLa-hACE2 target cells (Fig. 1B). The reason for this is unclear but may relate to glycan

130

heterogeneity within the S309 epitope (12) coupled with differences in receptor expression or

131

protease cleavage efficiency between the two types of target cells (23). Because SARS-CoV-2

132

D614G has emerged as the dominant pandemic strain (24), we also evaluated ADG-2 for

133

neutralizing activity against this variant in the MLV pseudovirus assay. As expected, based on

134

the location of the D614G substitution outside of the RBD, ADG-2 neutralized the D614G

135

variant with equivalent potency as wild-type (WT) SARS-CoV-2 (Fig. S5).

136

We further assessed the breadth of sarbecovirus recognition by ADG-2 by measuring its

137

apparent binding affinity (KDApp) to a panel of 17 representative sarbecovirus RBDs expressed on

138

the surface of yeast (25). Thirteen viruses were selected from clade I — representing the closest

139

known relatives of SARS-CoV-2 (GD-Pangolin and RaTG13) to the most divergent (SHC014

140

and Rs4231) — as well as four viruses from the distantly related clades 2 and 3, which do not

141

utilize ACE2 as a host receptor (26) (Fig. 2A). Recombinant hACE2-Fc and the benchmark

142

SARS-CoV-2 nAbs described above were also included as controls. Consistent with previous

143

reports (17, 25), hACE2 only recognized clade I RBDs and bound with higher affinity to SARS-

144

CoV-2 than SARS-CoV (Fig. 2B). In addition, the benchmark SARS-CoV-2 nAbs CB6/LY-

145

CoV016, REGN10987, and REGN10933 bound to the SARS-CoV-2 RBD with KDApps

146

comparable to published reports (Fig. 2B) (19, 20). Notably, S309 displayed diminished binding

147

in this expression platform, likely due to recognition of an epitope containing an N-glycan that

148

may be hyper-mannosylated in yeast (12).

149

Consistent with their broadly neutralizing activities, S309, ADG-2, and ADG-3 displayed

150

remarkably broad binding reactivity to clade I sarbecovirus RBDs, with ADG-2 and ADG-3

151

strongly binding 12/13 viruses and S309 binding all 13 (Fig. 2B). In contrast, ADG-1 only bound

152

to 9/13 viruses and CB6/LY-CoV016, REGN10987, and REGN10933 bound only the closest

153

evolutionary neighbor(s) of SARS-CoV-2, consistent with their narrow neutralization profiles

154

(Fig. 2B and Fig. 1C). Importantly, ADG-2 bound with high affinity (KDApp 0.24-1.12 nM) to

155

every clade I sarbecovirus RBD that exhibited detectable hACE2 binding in our assay. This

156

finding supports the high degree of ADG-2 epitope conservation among sarbecoviruses that use

157

hACE2 as a receptor.
Several recent studies have shown that RBD mutants that are resistant to commonly

158
159

elicited SARS-CoV-2 nAbs are circulating at low levels in the human population (24, 27). We

160

therefore sought to assess the breadth of ADG-2 binding to naturally circulating SARS-CoV-2

161

variants that contain single point mutations in the RBD. ADG-1, ADG-3, and the benchmark

162

SARS-CoV-2 nAbs were also included as comparators. Using the yeast surface-display platform

163

described above, we expressed the 30 most frequently observed SARS-CoV-2 RBD variants

164

reported in the GISAID database as well as six naturally circulating SARS-CoV-2 variants that

165

have been shown to be resistant to previously described SARS-CoV-2 nAbs (24, 27, 28). One or

166

more of the 36 SARS-CoV-2 variants exhibited loss of binding to ADG-1, CB6/LY-CoV016,

167

REGN10987, and REGN10933, as defined by >75% loss relative to the WT construct (Fig. 2C).

168

Notably, the loss-of-binding variants identified for REGN10987 and REGN10933 partially

169

overlapped with those identified in previous in vitro neutralization escape studies, validating the

170

use of RBD display for the prediction of antibody escape mutations (29). In contrast, ADG-2,

171

ADG-3, and S309 bound to all 36 variants at levels ≥50% of WT SARS-CoV-2 (Fig. 2C). This

172

result, combined with the remarkable neutralization breadth observed for these three mAbs (Fig.

173

1C and Fig. 2B, D), suggests a potential link between epitope conservation and resistance to viral

174

escape.

175
176

To gain further insight into the antigenic surface recognized by ADG-2, we generated a
mutagenized yeast surface-display RBD library and performed rounds of selection to identify

177

RBD variants that exhibited loss of binding to ADG-2 relative to the WT construct (Fig. 3A, Fig.

178

S6A, B). To exclude mutations that globally disrupt the conformation of the RBD, a final round

179

of positive selection was performed using a mixture of recombinant hACE2 and two RBD-

180

directed mAbs (S309 and CR3022) that target non-overlapping epitopes distinct from the ADG-2

181

binding site (12, 30) (Fig. S6B, and Fig. S7). Selected RBD mutants encoding single amino acid

182

substitutions were individually tested for binding to ADG-2, recombinant hACE2, CR3022, and

183

S309 to confirm site-specific knock-down mutations (Fig. S6C). Substitutions at only four RBD

184

positions specifically abrogated ADG-2 binding: D405E, G502E/R/V, G504A/D/R/S/V and

185

Y505C/N/S (Fig. 3B). These four residues are highly conserved among the clade I sarbecovirus

186

subgenus and invariant among SARS-CoV-1, SARS-CoV-2, SHC014 and WIV1 viruses (Fig.

187

3C), providing a molecular explanation for the breadth of binding and neutralization exhibited by

188

ADG-2. Consistent with the conservation of these residues among clade I sarbecoviruses, none

189

of the substitutions that impacted ADG-2 binding were present in full-length SARS-CoV-2

190

sequences deposited in the GISAID database as of October 19, 2020. In addition, 3 of the 4

191

identified mutations that abrogate ADG-2 binding lie within the hACE2 binding site (31) and at

192

least one mutation at each position (G502E/R/V, G504V and Y505C/N/S) also abrogated hACE2

193

binding (Fig. 3B), likely accounting for their absence among circulating SARS-CoV-2 isolates.

194

These results suggest that the evolutionary conservation of the ADG-2 epitope is likely directly

195

linked to ACE2 binding.

196

To support the results of this experiment, we performed low-resolution cryogenic

197

electron microscopy (cryo-EM) of the complex of ADG-2 bound to prefusion-stabilized SARS-

198

CoV-2 S. This yielded a ~6Å resolution 3D reconstruction that clearly had at least one ADG-2

200

previously determined high-resolution models of the SARS-CoV-2 spike and a homologous Fab

201

(Fig. 3D, Fig. S8A-D, Table S1). Consistent with our fine epitope mapping and competitive

202

binding experiments (Fig. 3B and Fig. S7C), the epitope recognized by ADG-2 overlaps with the

203

hACE2-binding site and each position identified by epitope mapping clustered to the cleft

204

between the heavy and light chains of ADG-2 (Fig. 3D). This epitope also partially overlaps with

205

those recognized by frequently observed “class 1” SARS-CoV-2 nAbs, which are exemplified by

206

VH3-53 antibodies with short CDRH3s and compete with hACE2 in the RBD “up” conformation

207

(32) (Fig. 3E). However, in contrast to previously reported nAbs in this class, ADG-2 binds with

208

a divergent angle of approach and displays broadly neutralizing activity (32) (Fig. 3E, Fig. 1C,

209

and Fig. S8E). Thus, ADG-2 binds to a highly conserved motif via a unique angle of approach,

210

providing additional structural insight into its broad recognition of SARS-like CoVs.

211

Because Fc-mediated effector functions can contribute to protection independently of

212

viral neutralization, we next assessed the ability of ADG-2 to induce antibody-dependent natural

213

killer cell activation and degranulation (ADNKDA), antibody-dependent cellular phagocytosis

214

(ADCP) mediated by monocytes and neutrophils, and antibody-mediated complement deposition

215

(ADCD) using previously described in vitro assays (33). Benchmark SARS-CoV-2 nAbs S309

216

and REGN10987 were also included as comparators. ADG-2 displayed a highly polyfunctional

217

profile, resulting in the induction of phagocytosis by monocytes and neutrophils, deposition of

218

the complement component C3, and induction of NK cell degranulation (a surrogate marker of

219

ADCC) and activation (Fig. 4). Interestingly, while ADG-2, S309, and REGN10957 showed

220

comparable recruitment of phagocytosis (Fig. 4B), these antibodies differed with respect to

221

complement deposition and NK cell activation (Fig. 4A, C); S309 showed reduced complement

222

deposition compared with ADG-2 and REGN10987, and ADG-2 showed superior NK cell

223

activation over both S309 and REGN10987 (Fig.4). In summary, ADG-2 robustly triggers

224

diverse Fc-mediated effector activities with potencies comparable or superior to those of current

225

lead SARS-CoV-2 clinical antibodies. However, it should be noted that the contribution of extra-

226

neutralizing activities to protection against SARS-CoV-2 is currently unknown and may vary

227

among different antibody specificities.

228

Finally, we tested the ability of ADG-2 to provide broad in vivo protection in

229

immunocompetent mouse models of SARS and COVID-19 using mouse-adapted SARS-CoV

230

(MA15)- and SARS-CoV-2 (MA10), respectively (34, 35). Balb/c mice were prophylactically

231

treated with either 200 𝜇g of ADG-2 or PBS via IP injection 12 hours prior to intranasal

232

challenge with a 103 PFU dose of MA15 or MA10. All mice were monitored daily for weight

233

loss and changes in respiratory function and groups of mice were euthanized at day two or four

234

post-infection to allow for measurement of virus replication in the lung and analysis of lung

235

histopathology. We observed substantial, progressive weight loss in sham-treated mice infected

236

with both viruses along with increases in Penh, a calculated measure of airway resistance (35). In

237

contrast, mice treated prophylactically with ADG-2 demonstrated minimal weight loss, no

238

change in Penh and no signs of gross pathology at the time of harvest (Fig. 5A, B). Furthermore,

239

prophylactic antibody treatment prevented viral replication in the lungs at both two and four days

240

post-infection (dpi). We next investigated the ability of ADG-2 to act anti-virally against SARS-

241

CoV-2 MA10 in a therapeutic setting. Mice were treated with 200 𝜇g of ADG-2 or PBS 12 hours

242

following intranasal challenge with a 103 PFU dose of MA10. Mice given therapeutic ADG-2

243

had intermediate levels of weight loss, moderate respiratory function changes and some gross

244

lung pathology; significantly more than prophylactically-treated mice but significantly less than

245

sham-treated mice (Fig. 5C). Therapeutic antibody treatment also resulted in a significant

246

reduction in lung viral loads at four dpi, but not at two dpi, relative to sham-treated mice. We

247

conclude that ADG-2 treatment can reduce disease burden in mice infected with both SARS-

248

CoV MA15 and SARS-CoV-2 MA10.
Since the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic, a plethora of potently neutralizing

249
250

SARS-CoV-2 antibodies have been isolated, and some have rapidly advanced into clinical trials

251

(36). However, the epitopes recognized by most of these nAbs are highly variable among other

252

clade 1a and 1b sarbecoviruses, hence limiting their neutralization breadth and increasing their

253

susceptibility to antibody escape mutations (27). Here, we described an engineered antibody that

254

neutralizes SARS-CoV-2 with a potency that rivals current lead SARS-CoV-2 clinical nAbs, but

255

also broadly neutralizes other clade I sarbecoviruses, potently triggers Fc-mediated effector

256

functions, and provides significant protection against SARS and COVID-19 disease in mouse

257

models. Thus, ADG-2 represents a promising candidate for the prevention and treatment of not

258

only COVID-19 but also future respiratory diseases caused by pre-emergent SARS-related

259

CoVs. Furthermore, our fine epitope mapping and structural studies demonstrate that ADG-2

260

employs a unique angle of approach to recognize a highly conserved epitope overlapping the

261

receptor binding site. This epitope represents an Achilles’ heel for clade 1a and 1b

262

sarbecoviruses and hence an attractive target for the rational design of “pan-SARS” vaccines that

263

aim to elicit similar broadly protective antibodies.

Methods and Materials

558

HeLa-hACE2 stable cell line

559

Stable human ACE2 (hACE2)-expressing HeLa cells for authentic SARS-CoV-2 neutralization

560

assays were generated as previously described (11). Briefly, hACE2 (NM_001371415) was

561

cloned into the pBOB vector and co-transfected with lentiviral vectors pMDL (Addgene

562

#12251), pREV (Addgene #12253), and pVSV-G (Addgene #8454) into HEK293T cells using

563

Lipofectamine 2000 (Thermo Fisher Scientific) according to the manufacturer’s protocol.

564

Culture media was exchanged 16 hours post-transfection, and supernatant was harvested 32

565

hours post-transfection. Pre-seeded HeLa cells were transduced using harvested supernatant with

566

10 μg/mL polybrene (Sigma). At 12 hours post-transduction, cell surface expression of hACE2

567

was confirmed by flow cytometry.

568

Authentic SARS-CoV neutralization assay

569

To generate authentic SARS-CoV, Vero African grivet monkey kidney cells (Vero E6, ATCC-

570

CRL1586) were grown in Dulbecco’s Modified Eagle Medium (DMEM high glucose; Gibco,

571

Cat # 11995065), 2% heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum (FBS, Atlanta Biologicals), 0.05%

572

Trypsin-EDTA solution (Gibco), 1% Pen/Strep (Gibco), and 1% GlutaMAX (Gibco). Cells were

573

infected with SARS-CoV/Urbani at a multiplicity of infection (MOI) of 0.01 and incubated at 37

574

°C with 5% CO2 and 80% relative humidity (RH). 50 hours post-infection, cells were frozen at -

575

80 °C for 1 hour and then thawed at room temperature (RT). The supernatant was collected and

576

clarified by centrifugation at 2500 x g for 10 minutes before aliquoting for storage at -80 °C.

577

Virus neutralization was assessed as previously described (11). Briefly, SARS-CoV/Urbani

578

(MOI = 0.2) was added to serial dilutions of antibodies and incubated for 1 hour at RT. The

579

antibody-virus mixture was applied to monolayers of Vero E6 cells in a 96-well plate and

580

incubated for 1 hour at 37 °C, 5% CO2 and 80% RH. Next, media was exchanged by washing

581

cells once with 1x PBS and adding fresh cell culture media. At 24-hour post-infection, cells were

582

washed out of media with 1x PBS to then be treated with formalin fixing solution, permeabilized

583

with 0.2% Triton-X for 10 minutes at RT, and finally treated with blocking solution. Fixed and

584

permeabilized cells were first stained with a primary antibody recognizing SARS-CoV

585

nucleocapsid protein (Sino Biological), followed by secondary antibody staining with

586

AlexaFluor 488-conjugated goat anti-rabbit antibody. Infected cells were enumerated by an

587

Operetta high content imaging instrument, and data was analyzed using Harmony software

588

(Perkin Elmer).

589

MLV-SARS-CoV-2 pseudovirus neutralization assay

590

To generate the MLV pseudoviruses, pCDNA3.3 plasmids (ThermoFisher) encoding the WT

591

(NC_045512) or D614G-variant SARS-CoV-2 spike gene with a 28 amino acid deletion at its C-

592

terminus (IDT); a luciferase reporter gene plasmid (Addgene # 18760) modified with a

593

cytomegalovirus (CMV) promoter to replace the internal ribosome entry site (IRES); and a

594

murine leukemia virus (MLV) Gag-Pol plasmid (Addgene # 14887) were purified using the

595

Endo-Free Plasmid Maxi Kit (Qiagen) according to manufacturer’s instructions. To generate

596

single-round infection competent pseudoviruses, HEK293T cells were co-transfected with 2 µg

597

of MLV Gag-Pol-, 2 µg of MLV luciferase-, and 0.5 µg of either SARS-CoV-2 WT S or SARS-

598

CoV-2 D614G S-encoding plasmids in 6-well plates using Lipofectamine 2000 (Thermo

599

600

16 hours post-transfection. At 48 hours post-transfection, the supernatant containing SARS-CoV-

601

2 S-pseudotyped viral particles was harvested, aliquoted, and frozen at -80 °C.

602

Antibody neutralization of pseudoviruses was assessed via a luminescence-based assay on HeLa-

603

hACE2 cells as previously described (39). The SARS-CoV-2 WT or D614G pseudovirus was

604

mixed with serially diluted antibodies, incubated for 1 hour at 37 °C, and applied to 10,000

605

HeLa-hACE2 cells. Following infection for 42-48 hours at 37 °C, HeLa-hACE2 cells were lysed

606

with 1x luciferase lysis buffer (25 mM Gly-Gly pH 7.8, 15 mM MgSO4, 4 mM EGTA, 1%

607

Triton X-100). Luciferase intensity was measured on a luminometer using Bright-Glo luciferase

608

substrate (Promega, PR-E2620) following manufacturer’s directions. Percentage of

609

neutralization was calculated from sample and control relative units of light (RUL) according to

610

the formula: 100*(1–[RULsample – RULbackrground]/[RULvirus-only – RULbackground]).

611

Authentic WIV-1, SHC014 and SARS-CoV-2 nano-luciferase (nLuc) neutralization assays

612

Mouse-adapted SARS-CoV (MA15), mouse adapted SARS-CoV-2 (MA2) and WT SARS-CoV-

613

2 nano-luciferase (nLuc) viruses were generated by CoV reverse genetics as described previously

614

(40). WIV-1-nLuc and SHC014-nLuc were generated by replacing the CoV ORF7 and ORF8

615

regions with nano-luciferase. All nLuc viral assays were performed with Vero E6 cells, which

616

were grown in DMEM high glucose media (Gibco, Cat # 11995065) supplemented with 10%

617

fetal clone II (GE, Cat # SH3006603HI), 1% non-essential amino acids, and 1% Pen/Strep at

618

37ºC and 5% CO2. Vero E6 cells were seeded at 2 x 104 cells/well in a black-wall, tissue culture

619

treated, 96-well plate (Corning, Cat # 3603) 24 hours prior to pseudovirus assays.

620

Antibodies were serially diluted in growth media and mixed at a 1:1 ratio with either 75 plaque

624

E6 cells and incubated at 37 ºC with 5% CO2 for 48 hours (SARS-CoV-MA15, SARS-CoV-2-

625

MA2 and SARS-CoV-2-nLuc) or 24 hours (SHC014-nLuc and WIV1-nLuc). Luciferase

626

activities were measured by the Nano-Glo Luciferase Assay System (Promega Cat. #N1130),

627

following the manufacturer’s protocol, using a SpectraMax M3 luminometer (Molecular

628

Devices). Percent inhibition was calculated by the following equation: 100*(1 – [RLUsample/

629

RLUmock-treatment]). Half-maximal inhibitory concentrations (IC50) were calculated for each

630

condition by curve-fitting with non-linear regression.

631

Authentic SARS-CoV-2 neutralization assay

632

Authentic SARS-CoV-2 virus was produced in Vero E6 cells as described previously (23). Vero

633

E6 cells were grown overnight in complete DMEM (Corning, Cat # 15-013-CV) supplemented

634

with 10% FBS, 1x Pen/Strep (Corning, Cat # C20-002-CL), and 2 mM L-Glutamine (Corning,

635

Cat # 25-005-CL) at 37˚C and 5% CO2. Cells were incubated with 2 mL of SARS-CoV-2 strain

636

USA-WA1/2020 (BEI Resources, Cat # NR-52281) at MOI of 0.5 for 30 minutes at 34˚C and

637

5% CO2, followed by direct addition of 30 mL of complete DMEM. At 5 days post-infection, the

638

supernatant was collected and centrifuged at 1000 x g for 5 minutes, passed through 0.22 µM

639

filters, and frozen at -80 °C for future use.

640

Antibody neutralization against authentic SARS-CoV-2 was assessed using both Vero E6 and

641

HeLa-hACE2 target cells. Both types of target cells were grown in complete DMEM at 37˚C and

642

5% CO2. For neutralization assays, HeLa-hACE2 or Vero E6 target cells were seeded in a 96-

643

644

grown overnight. 1,000 plaque forming units (PFU)/well of SARS-CoV-2 was added to titrating

645

amounts of antibody and incubated for 30 minutes. The virus-antibody mixture was subsequently

646

incubated with either HeLa-hACE2 or Vero E6 cells for 24 hours at 37˚C and 5% CO2.

647

Following incubation, the infection media was removed. Cells were submerged in 4%

648

formaldehyde for 1 hour, followed by three cycles of washing with PBS, and incubated with 100

649

µL/well of permeabilization buffer (1x PBS with 1% Triton-X) with gentle shaking. The plates

650

were then blocked with 100 µL of 3% [w/v] bovine serum albumin (BSA) for 2 hours at room

651

temperature (RT) and subsequently washed out of blocking solution with wash buffer (1x PBS

652

with 0.1% Tween-20).

653

SARS-CoV-2 viruses were detected with a mixture of CC6.29, CC6.33, L25-dP06E11, CC12.23,

654

and CC12.25 antibodies, previously derived from a cohort of convalescent SARS-CoV-2 donors

655

(23). Pooled antibodies were added to wells at a concentration of 2 µg/mL (50 µL/well) and

656

incubated for 2 hours at RT. Cells were subsequently washed 3 times with wash buffer, stained

657

with 0.5 µg/mL peroxidase-conjugated AffiniPure goat anti-human IgG (Jackson

658

ImmunoResearch Laboratories, Inc, Cat # 109-035-088) for 2 hours at RT, and followed by 6

659

washes with wash buffer. Freshly prepared HRP substrate (Roche, Ca # 11582950001) at a 100:1

660

volume ratio of Solution A:B was added to each well. Chemiluminescence was measured using a

661

microplate luminescence reader (BioTek, Synergy 2).

662

A standard curve of serially diluted virus from 3000 to 1 PFU was plotted against relative light

663

units (RLU) using a 4-parameter logistic regression as follows: y = a + (b – a) / (1 + (x / x0)c),

664

where y = variable in RLU, x = variable in PFU and a, b, c and x0 are parameters fit by the

679

transfected into FreeStyle293F cells (Thermo Fisher) using polyethylenimine. Two hours post-

680

transfection, cells were treated with kifunensine to ensure uniform, high-mannose glycosylation.

681

Cell supernatants were harvested after 6 days of protein expression. SARS-CoV-2 RBD-SD1

682

was purified using Protein A resin (Pierce) and SARS-CoV-2 S-2P and SARS-Cov-2 HexaPro S

683

were purified using StrepTactin resin (IBA). Affinity-purified SARS-CoV-2 RBD-SD1 was

684

oligos spanning CDRH1, CDRH2, CDRH3, CDRL1, CDRL2, and CDRL3 (IDT). Overlap-

690

extension PCR was used to assemble and amplify forward-priming NNK oligos and reverse-

691

priming oligo pools covering framework regions 1-4 with added homology to the CDR oligos to

692

generate full-length variable regions. For the CDRH1/CDRH2/CDRH3 selections, heavy-chain

693

variable regions (HCFR1-HCFR4) and the unmutated light-chain variable regions of the

694

nominated parent were recombined in situ by homologous recombination with linearized vector

695

to create a yeast library of 1 x 107 diversity via electroporation.

696

Heavy- and light-chain libraries of each parent antibody (ADI-55688, ADI-55689, and ADI-

697

56046) were subject to two rounds of selection for binding to a recombinant SARS-CoV-2 S1

698

protein (Sino Biological, Cat # 40591-V08H). Induced yeast libraries covering at least 10-fold of

699

their respective diversities were incubated with 10 or 1 nM biotinylated SARS-CoV-2 S1 protein

700

under equilibrium conditions. Yeast was washed twice in PBSF (1x PBS, 0.1% [w/v] BSA),

701

stained with anti-human LC-FITC (Southern Biotech), Streptavidin 633 (Invitrogen, Cat #

702

S21375), and propidium iodide (Invitrogen, Cat # P1304MP) for 15 minutes on ice. Labeled

703

cells were subsequently washed twice and resuspended in PBSF before sorting on a BD FACS

704

Aria II (Becton Dickerson). Gates were drawn for cells with improved S1 binding over parental

705

clones.

706

Following two rounds of sorting, the variable heavy and light regions of enriched output clones

707

were recombined to generate new CDRH1/CDRH2/CDRH3/CDRL1/CDRL2/CDRL3 libraries.

708

An additional two rounds of selections were performed as described above. Sorted yeast from the

709

final round of selection were resuspended in SDCAA media and plated on SDCAA agar plates

710

for single colony isolation and sequencing.

Expression and purification of IgGs and Fab fragments

712

Monoclonal antibodies ADI-55688, ADI-55689, and ADI-56046, as well as their progeny, were

713

produced as full-length IgG1 proteins in S. cerevisiae cultures, as previously described (11).

714

Briefly, yeast cultures were incubated in 24-well plates placed in Infors Multitron shaking

715

incubators at 30 °C, 650 rpm, and 80% relative humidity. After 6 days, the supernatants

716

containing the IgGs were harvested by centrifugation and purified by protein A-affinity

717

chromatography. The bound IgGs were eluted with 200 mM acetic acid with 50 mM NaCl (pH

718

3.5) into 1/8 [v/v] 2 M HEPES (pH 8.0) and buffer-exchanged into PBS (pH 7.0).

719

ADG1-3 and benchmark SARS-CoV-2 mAbs REGN10933, REGN10987, CB6/LY-CoV016,

720

and S309 were expressed in CHO cells as full-length IgG1 proteins. The VH- and VL-encoding

721

gene fragments were subcloned into heavy- and light-chain vectors and transiently transfected

722

into CHO cells. After 6 days, the supernatants containing the IgGs were harvested by

723

centrifugation and purified by protein A-affinity chromatography. Bound IgGs were eluted and

724

further purified by size exclusion chromatography (SEC) to at least 95% purity, then buffer-

725

exchanged into 150 mM NaCl with 20 mM histidine, pH 6.0.

726

Fab fragments for structural studies were generated by digestion with papain for 2 hours at 30

727

°C, followed by the addition of iodoacetamide to terminate the reaction. To remove the Fc

728

fragments and any undigested IgG fractions, the mixtures were passed over Protein A agarose.

729

The flow-through of the Protein A resin was then passed over CaptureSelect™ IgG-CH1 affinity

730

resin (ThermoFisher Scientific) and the captured Fabs were eluted with 200 mM acetic acid with

731

50 mM NaCl (pH 3.5) into 1/8 [v/v] 2 M HEPES (pH 8.0), followed by buffer exchange into

732

PBS (pH 7.0).

Surface plasmon resonance Fab kinetic binding measurements

734

SEC-purified SARS-CoV-2 RBD-SD1 was immobilized to a Ni-NTA sensor chip in a Biacore

735

X100 (GE Life Sciences) to a response level of ~500 RUs. Fabs were then injected at increasing

736

concentrations, ranging from 18.75-300 nM (ADI-55688), 1.56-25 nM (ADI-56046), 6.25-100

737

nM (ADI-55689), or 1.25-20 nM (ADG-1, ADG-2, ADG-1). The sensor chip was doubly

738

regenerated between cycles using 0.35 M EDTA and 0.1 M NaOH. The resulting data were

739

double-reference subtracted and fit to a 1:1 binding model using Biacore Evaluation Software.

Competition of ADG-2 with recombinant hACE2-Fc protein (Sino Biological, Cat # 10108-

742

H02H). CR3022, and S309 for binding to soluble SARS-CoV-2 S trimer was assessed using the

743

ForteBio Octet HTX (Sartorius Bioanalytical Instruments). All reagents were diluted to 100 nM

744

in PBSF. Anti-heavy-chain (AHC) sensor tips were loaded with S309 or ADG-2 IgG, followed

745

by exposure to an inert IgG to block any remaining Fc capture sites. Tips were subsequently

746

equilibrated in PBSF for 30 minutes. IgG-loaded sensor tips were transferred to wells containing

747

hACE2, CR3022, or S309 to check for any interaction with the loaded IgG. Sensor tips were

748

then loaded in wells containing fresh PBSF buffer (60 seconds), followed by exposure to SARS-

749

CoV-2 S protein (180 seconds), and lastly, exposure to hACE2, CR3022, or S309 (180 seconds).

750

Data were cropped to include only SARS-CoV-2 S protein and hACE2, CR3022, or S309

Polyreactivity assay

806

Polyspecificity reagent binding of antibodies was performed as described previously (37).

807

Briefly, soluble membrane protein (SMP) and soluble cytosolic protein (SCP) fractions were

808

extracted from Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells and biotinylated using NHS-LC-Biotin

822

prepared and further incubated at a 1:9 volume ratio with 20 nm gold nanoparticles (AuNP; Ted

823

Pella Inc.) for 1 hour at room temperature (RT). Thiolated PEG (Sigma-Aldrich) was then used

824

to block empty sites on the AuNP and filtered via a 0.22 μm PVDF membrane (Millipore).

825

Coated particles were subsequently added to the test antibody solution and incubated for 2 hours

826

at RT before measuring absorbance from 510 to 570 nm on a plate reader. Data points were fit

827

with a second-order polynomial in Excel to obtain wavelengths at maximum absorbance. Values

828

are reported as the difference between plasmon wavelengths of the sample and background

Sarbecovirus phylogeny and alignment

847

Representative sarbecovirus RBD-SD1 sequences were selected based on previously curated

848

sequence sets (25, 26). Four additional ACE2-utilizing clade I sarbecoviruses (Frankfurt 1,

849

CS24, Civet 007-2004, and A021) not represented in these curated sets were included for added

850

diversity at the RBD-ACE2 interface. A limited set of clade 2 and clade 3 viruses, which do not

851

utilize ACE2 as a target receptor (26), were included as controls. A phylogram of sarbecoviruses

852

was generated using maximum likelihood analysis of MAFFT-aligned RBD-SD1 sequences.

853

Multiple sequence alignment of sarbecovirus RBD sequences was visualized in Jalview. Amino

854

acid sequences for each sarbecovirus were colored by percentage sequence identity and the

855

overall degree of conservation per residue was calculated as a numerical index weighted by

856

physio-chemical properties of amino acids (44).

Antibody binding to yeast surface-displayed RBD variants

891

To assess binding breadth, IgGs and recombinant hACE2 (expressed in a bivalent format as a C-

892

terminal IgG1 Fc conjugate; Sino Biological, Cat # 10108-H02H) were tested against the panel

893

of 17 sarbecovirus RBDs. Initially, binding was determined at a single 100 nM concentration of

894

IgG or hACE2. Induced cells (0.2 OD600 / well) were aliquoted into 96-well plates and washed

895

out of SGCAA media with PBSF. Cells were resuspended in 100 µL of 100 nM IgG or hACE2

896

and incubated at room temperature for 30 minutes. Cells were subsequently washed twice with

897

PBSF and labeled with 50 µL of APC-conjugated monoclonal mouse anti-hemagglutinin tag

898

(HA).11 antibody (BioLegend, Cat # 901524), PE-conjugated goat anti-human IgG polyclonal

899

antibodies (Southern Biotech, Cat # 2040-09), and propidium iodide (Invitrogen, Cat #

900

P1304MP) for 20 minutes on ice. For each sarbecovirus RBD, a secondary reagent control was

901

included. Cells were washed twice with PBSF before analyzing via flow cytometry on a BD

902

FACS Canto II (BD Biosciences).

903

To account for differences in RBD expression across sarbecoviruses, binding signal was

904

normalized to HA-tag signals (MFIanti-human IgG PE/MFIanti-HA APC). Binding with normalized ratios

905

below 1.0 were considered non-binding (NB) at the concentration tested. Those with ratios above

906

1.0 were titrated between 100 nM to 0.048 nM to calculate their apparent binding affinity

907

(KDApp). Mean anti-human IgG PE MFI signal was normalized according to the formula:

908

(MFIsample – MFIminimum)*100/(1 – MFIminimum) and fitted as nonlinear regression curves in

X), where X is the IgG or hACE2 concentration and Y is the normalized binding signal.

911

Concentrations displaying hook effects, defined as concentrations higher than those generating

912

the maximum PE MFI signal, were excluded from analysis. To maximize the dynamic range of

913

potential differences in binding affinity to SARS-CoV-2 variants, binding experiments were

914

conducted at each antibody’s respective SARS-CoV-2 KDApp concentration. Binding signal was

915

normalized using the following equation: (MFIanti-hu IgG PE/MFIanti-HA APC) – (MFIbackground anti-hu IgG

PE/MFIbackground anti-HA APC),

ePCR library construction and selection of RBD mutants

919

SARS-COV-2 RBD-SD1 gBlock (IDT) was amplified by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) with

920

iProof High-Fidelity PCR system (Bio-Rad, Cat # 1725310) following the manufacturer’s

921

recommendations. The amplified DNA was purified (Nucleospin Gel and PCR Clean-up Kit,

922

Macherey-Nagel, Cat # 740609.250) and subsequently mutagenized by error-prone PCR (ePCR)

923

via the GeneMorph II Random Mutagenesis Kit (Agilent Technologies, Cat # 200550) with a

924

target nucleotide mutation frequency of 0–4.5 mutations per kilobase of DNA. The mutagenized

925

DNA product was cloned into yeast via electroporation as described earlier. The ePCR library

926

was validated by plating a subset of the transformed ePCR yeast library on tryptophan dropout

927

agar plates (Teknova, Cat # C6099) and sequencing single colonies. Prior to performing FACS

928

selection, the ePCR RBD-SD1 library and WT RBD-SD1 yeast were induced as described

929

above.

930

To select for mutants with diminished binding to ADG-2, induced cells were incubated for 30

931

minutes on ice with ADG-2 IgG diluted in PBSF to its EC80 concentration, which was calculated

932

by titration on the yeast surface-displayed WT RBD-SD1 construct. Cells were washed twice in

933

PBSF, stained in a secondary staining mixture, and analyzed on a BD FACS Aria II (Becton

934

Dickerson), as described above. A subset of yeast population exhibiting HA-tag expression and

935

reduced ADG-2 binding relative to the WT RBD-SD1 construct were sorted and propagated in

936

SDCAA media for 48 hours at 30 °C. Selection was repeated for a second round to further enrich

937

yeast encoding ADG-2 binding knock-down mutations. In the final round of selection, the

938

induced library was stained with a mixture of recombinant hACE2-Fc, and S309 and CR3022

939

IgGs at their respective EC80 concentrations. The subset of the stained population that mirrored

940

the binding profile of WT RBD-SD1-stained yeast was sorted and plated on agar plates for

941

isolation and sequencing of single colonies. Clones possessing single amino acid substitutions

942

identified from sequencing were cultured, induced, and evaluated for binding to ADG-2, S309,

943

CR3022 IgGs and recombinant hACE2-Fc at their respective EC80 concentrations through flow

944

cytometric analysis on the BD FACS Canto II (BD Biosciences). Binding signal was normalized

945

and calculated as a percentage of the binding signal to reference WT RBD-SD1, as described

946

above.

Cryo-EM studies

948

SEC-purified SARS-CoV-2 HexaPro S was diluted to a concentration of 0.35mg/mL in a buffer

949

composed of 2 mM Tris pH 8.0, 200 mM NaCl and 0.02% NaN3. Diluted spike was mixed with

950

a two-fold molar excess of ADG-2 Fab and allowed to bind on ice for 5 minutes before the

951

mixture was applied to a plasma-cleaned CF-1.2/1.3 grid. Excess liquid was blotted away using a

952

Vitrobot Mark IV (Thermo Fisher) and the grid was vitrified by rapid plunging into liquid

ethane. 4,748 micrographs were collected using Leginon (45) in a Titan Krios (Thermo Fisher)

954

equipped with a K3 direct electron detector (Gatan). Motion correction, CTF-estimation and

955

particle picking were performed in Warp (46) and extracted particles were imported into

956

cryoSPARC v2.15.0 (47). 2D and 3D classification resulted in a final stack of 57,078 particles,

957

which was used to calculate a 5.94 Å 3D reconstruction using non-uniform refinement (48).

958

High-resolution crystallographic models of the SARS-CoV-2 RBD (PDB ID: 6M0J) (31) and a

959

homologous Fab (PDB ID: 6APC) (49) were docked into the density using Chimera (50). A full

Animal studies

962

Twelve-month old female Balb/c mice (Envigo, strain 047) were treated with 200 μg of ADG-2

963

IgG via intraperitoneal (IP) injection at either 12 hours prior to infection (prophylactic) or 12

964

hours post-infection (therapeutic). Mice were anesthetized with ketamine/xylazine before being

965

challenged with 1000 PFU of either SARS-CoV-MA15 or SARS2-CoV-2-MA10 (34, 35) via

966

intranasal inoculation. Mouse body weights and respiratory function were monitored daily for 4

967

days. Respiratory function was monitored by whole body plethysmography (DSI) with a 30-

968

minute acclimation period and a 5-minute measurement window as previously described (51).

969

Viral lung titer was measured by plaque assay, assessing the lower lobe of the right lung. Gross

970

pathology was performed on mice sacrificed on day 2 and day 4 post-infection. Gross pathology

971

in the lung scored using a 4-point system, in which 0 represents no hemorrhage and 4 represents

972

complete and total hemorrhage. All animal husbandry and experiments were performed at BSL3

973

and in accordance with all University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill Institutional Animal Care

974

and Use Committee guidelines (AAALAC Institutional Number 329).
