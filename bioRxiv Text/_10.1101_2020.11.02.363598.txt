Summary.
Data on potential effectiveness and prospects of treatment of new coronavirus infection of COVID-19 caused
by virus SARS-CoV-2 with the help of antisense oligonucleotides acting against RNA of virus on an in vitro
model are given. The ability of antisense oligonucleotides to suppress viral replication in diseases caused by
coronaviruses using the example of SARS and MERS is shown. The identity of the initial regulatory section
of RNA of various coronaviruses was found within 50 - 100 nucleotides from the 5 '-end, which allows using
antisense suppression of this RNA fragment. A new RNA fragment of the virus present in all samples of
coronovirus SARS-CoV-2 has been identified, the suppression of which with the help of an antisense
oligonucleotide can be effective in the treatment of COVID-19. The study of the synthesized antisense
oligonucleotide 5` – AGCCGAGTGACAGCC ACACAG, complementary to the selected virus RNA
sequence, was carried out. The low toxicity of the preparations of this group in the cell culture study and the
ability to reduce viral load at high doses according to real time-PCR data are shown. The cytopathogenic dose
exceeds 2 mg / ml. At a dosage of 1 mg / ml, viral replication is reduced by 5-13 times. Conclusions are made
about the prospects of this direction and the feasibility of using the inhalation way of drug administration
into the body.

Introduction.
The coronavirus pandemic has shown the unpreparedness of the world
community for the sixth technological paradigm, which is based on nano- and
biomedical technologies. Overcoming the interspecies barrier and the accidental
penetration of the wild strain of the coronavirus infection SARS-CoV-2 of bats
into the human population caused a pandemic and a severe economic crisis due to
anti-epidemic measures.
The need for a quickly response to such large-scale threats in the event of a
massive influx of infected people and the threat of even greater contamination of
the population forces us to look for ways to urgently treat the flow of patients and
virus carriers. Moreover, this applies not only to the current, but also to future
epidemics that may be caused by other respiratory viruses - influenza, respiratory
syncytial virus, rhinoviruses, paramyxoviruses, etc. One of the possible directions
in the therapy of viral infections caused by RNA viruses is therapy with antisense
oligonucleotides. These drugs act on unique sites of the virus genome and are a
promising trend in genetic technologies.
Presently, there are no specific antivirals for a huge array of viruses.
However, methods are being developed for specifically selectively "turning off"
RNA, including viral, using antisense oligonucleotides. The principle of action of

antisense oligonucleotides consists in administering to the body of the patient a
drug containing single-strand DNA chains which is complementary to any site of
single-strand DNA or RNA, for example, virus RNA. Complementary binding of
DNA of the preparation and RNA of the virus leads to impossibility of
transcription and translation of viral RNA and cutting of blocked section of RNA
of the virus by RNase H. This stops synthesis of new viral particles and prevents
intracellular propagation of the virus [12].
Several antiviral antisense drugs have been marketed, for example
Fomivirsen® (Vitraven®) - a drug against cytomegalovirus (Novartis), Miravirsen®
- a drug for the treatment of hepatitis C (Santaris Pharma). Currently, more than
100 drugs for various diseases based on the use of antisense oligonucleotides are
undergoing clinical trials in various phases.
Antisense therapy is a developing strategy for the specific treatment of new
and socially significant diseases. The principle of RNA inhibition has previously
been studied in vitro to inhibit replication of highly pathogenic RNA-viruses [6, 8].
Thus, given the previous experience of antisense oligonucleotide therapy, it
can be assumed that this strategy can be applied as an antiviral drug by binding and
cleavage of RNA SARS-CoV-2.
Considering that SARS-CoV-2 is an RNA virus that does not integrate into
the host genome, the strategy of using antisense oligonucleotides, according to
some authors, can give effective results [1, 9].
Prerequisites for the use of antisense therapy in the treatment of COVID 19
exist. Coronavirus infections have previously caused outbreaks of epidemics. In
particular, the outbreak of SARS (severe acute respiratory syndrome) in China in
2002-2003 was caused by coronavirus SARS-CoV, the outbreak of Middle Eastern
respiratory syndrome (MERS) was also caused by coronavirus [3, 14].
After the SARS epidemic, a number of authors conducted studies on the
effect of antisense therapy on the suppression of coronavirus growth in the tissues
under investigation [10, 11, 13]. In work (10), the authors found among several
sequences the most effective viral transcription inhibitors, suppressing the
reproduction of coronavirus in cells and preventing infection of other cells. These
are antisense blockers complementary to the initial nucleotides of viral RNA - the
so-called regulatory transcription sequences of TRS (in the terminology of the
authors) of the coronavirus strain SARS-CoV-Tor2 (GenBank AY274119). The
nucleotide sequence of the antisense preparations examined is shown in Table 1:

The authors used morpholine side chain modification to prevent destruction
of antisense oligonucleotide and conjugation with arginine polypeptide to improve
penetration into infected cells.
By comparison of these nucleotide sequences (table 2) to the sequence of a
genome of the SARS-CoV-2 virus (COVID-19) the existence of these sequences
almost in all strains of a virus allocated at patients during a pandemic of 2019-2020
was revealed (Appendix 1, the nucleotide sequences are highlighted in red color
and a frame).
BLAST analysis (https://blast.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/Blast.cgi ) showed 100%
coincidence of the RNA sequence in all coronavirus subtypes, which suggests a
high conservatism of this region of the coronavirus genome. This makes it possible
to use for the treatment of coronavirus infection those antisense oligonucleotide
sequences TRS1 and TRS2, which were studied in 2005 by the collective [10].
However, starting from mid-March 2020, changes have been observed in the
virus strains associated with the loss of sites from the 5` end. In particular, the
MT263462 USA: WA 2020-03-23 virus sample did not have the regions
designated as trs1 and trs2.
In this regard, the study of an antisense oligonucleotide complementary to
the site of the conserved oligonucleotide sequence of the genome of the SARSCoV-2 virus present in all strains, which was the goal of the present study, seems
relevant.
In accordance with the purpose of the study, the following tasks were set:
- to select the nucleotide sequence of the virus that is supposed to be
inhibited,
- to carry out the synthesis of oligonucleotide,
- to determine cytotoxicity and antiviral activity in an in vitro experiment on
cell culture.

Material and methods.
1. Selection of nucleotide sequence.
The nucleotide sequence that was intended to block in the SARS-CoV-2
virus was selected next to the trs1 and trs2 genes at a distance of four nucleotides
from the final region (3 '-end) of the trs2 gene. This choice was due to the fact that
this sequence enters the site regulating transcription (transcription regulatory site,
trs) and disabling this sequence will also lead to the impossibility of transcription
by analogy with inhibition of trs1 and trs2 sites in work [10]. BLAST analysis on
the GenBank (NCBI) showed presence of this sequence at genomes of all
sequenced samples SARS-CoV-2. This sequence has the form:
5`–CTG TGT GGC TGT CAC TCG GCT
In the investigated nucleotide sequences of coronaviruses in Appendix 1,
this sequence is highlighted in green.
The complementary sequence of the antisense oligonucleotide preparation
for treatment has the form:
5`–AGC CGA GTG ACA GCC ACA CAG
The choice of the nucleotide sequence of the virus for blocking by the
antisense preparation was also dictated by the minimal ability to form nucleotide
hairpins that prevent hybridization of the RNA region of the virus and the antisense
preparation. When calculating this sequence on an oligocalculator [5], it was found
that over a period of 210 nucleotides from the 5 '-end of the viral RNA sequence,
nucleotides can theoretically form 38 - 39 hairpins, from which the sequence we
study can be involved in 6 hairpins, while the sequences trs1 and trs2 can be
fragments of 16 and 11 nucleotide hairpins, respectively. Thus, according to
theoretical calculations, we assumed a more specific nature of the selected
nucleotide sequence for blocking transcription and translation of the viral genome
than previously studied in the work (10).

nucleotides with purification of reverse-phase HPLC (Certificate for synthetic
oligonucleotides No. 1312 from 04/14/2020). The total amount of 21-membered

oligonucleotide synthesized was 15.371 mg (2.38 μmol). The choice of
phosphorothioate protection of an oligonucleotide to prevent nuclease degradation
of an antisense oligonucleotide is due to the low toxicity of phosphorothioate
modifications, commercial availability, the possibility of synthesizing large
quantities in routine automatic synthesis on DNA synthesizers.
3. Study of toxicity and antiviral activity
The study of toxicity and antiviral activity was carried out by order at the
Test Center for Quality Control of Immunobiological Medicines of "National
Research Center for Epidemiology and Microbiology named after N.F. Gamalea
"of the Ministry of Health of Russia (Study No. 0044/20 of 09/11/2020).
The study included the study of the cytotoxic effect of the antisense drug,
the study of the antiviral activity of the drug during the therapeutic regimen of drug
administration, the detection of SARS-CoV-2 RNA by real-time PCR.
In the experimental work, a transplantable cell line of the kidney of the
African green monkey (Chlorocebus aethiops) Vero-E6 was used. Cell cultivation
was carried out in a cell growth medium supplemented with fetal bovine serum
(FBS) (final concentration 10%).
The studies used a pandemic strain of human coronavirus SARS-CoV-2
"GK2020/1" passage 4, with an infectious activity of 10 6 TCID50/ml (tissue
cytopathogenic doses) for Vero E6 cells from the State Collection of Viruses of
«National Research Center for Epidemiology and Microbiology named after N.F.
Gamalea".
The virus was cultured in a Vero E6 cell culture for 96 hours at 37° C in a
5% CO2 atmosphere. Infectious activity was determined according to the methods
recommended by WHO.
The cytotoxic action of the preparation in Vero Е6 cell culture was
determined using 96-well culture flat-bottomed plates in which Vero Е6 cells were
placed at 12,000 cells/well in a volume of 100 μl of freshly prepared complete
medium. Cultivation was carried out by 24 hours at a temperature of 37 °C in the
atmosphere of 5% of CO2. After incubating the cells with the preparations for 96
hours at a temperature of 37 oC in an atmosphere of 5% СО2, the condition of the
cell monolayer was visually evaluated. The culture medium was then removed
from the plates and 100 μl of reaction medium and 20 μl of MTS (3-(4,5dimethylthiazol-2-yl) - 5 - (3-carboxymethoxyphenyl) - 2-(4-sulfophenyl)-2H-tetrazolium)
solution were added to each well to the cell culture monolayer. After incubation for
3 hours at 37 oC, the results were taken into account on the BIORAD automatic
reader at a wavelength of 490 nm. Reference filter was - 630 nm. The

concentration of preparations reducing the optical density at 490 nm by 50%
compared to the control of cells was taken as 50% of the cytotoxic dose (CC50).
The experiment to assess the viability of cells in the antiviral efficacy test
was carried out in the range of drug concentrations that are not toxic to cells (i.e.,
lower than the detected CC50 value).
The antiviral activity of the sample was assessed visually under a
microscope 96 hours after infection by inhibition of the cytopathic effect of the
virus in a Vero E6 cell culture. The result was assessed by Δlgmax - the maximum
decrease in the value of the infectious viral dose in the experiment in comparison
with the control, expressed in decimal logarithms. The study of the antiviral
activity of the antisense oligonucleotide substance in the Vero E6 cell culture was
carried out with a choice of concentrations based on the results of the cytotoxicity
study. Working solutions of the test drug were prepared with concentrations of 1.0
mg/ml; 0.1 mg/ml; 0.01 mg/ml and 0.001 mg/ml, respectively.
The Vero E6 cells used in the study were grown in 96 well culture plates in a
volume of 100 μl full for 24 hours at 37 °C in an atmosphere of 5% CO2. Seed
dose - 12,000 cells / well. 100.0 μl of solutions of the test drug were pipetted from
the dilution plates of the test drug to the test plates with cells. Each point was
tested in 4 parallel wells. The preparations corresponding to the dilution scheme
were added to the control wells without virus (to assess the potential cytotoxic
effect and further take into account the study results). In the wells of the control
cells, a medium was added for staging the reaction.
The preparation of dilutions of the viral suspension for the study of antiviral
activity was carried out by adding a suspension of SARS-CoV-2, passage 4, with
an infectious activity of 106 TCID50 / ml for Vero E6 cells to the plates with a
monolayer of Vero E6 cell culture: 10 1-106 The suspension was diluted by
sequential transfer in test tubes with the required amount of the reaction medium 900 µl of the reaction medium and 100 µl of the viral suspension.
Determination of viral production by cytopathic action was carried out on
the basis of analysis of cell viability using microscopy, in order to visually
determine the boundaries of viral cell damage, as well as to control the toxicity of
doses of substances.
The assessment of antiviral activity of the drug in addition to cytopathic
action was also taken into account by reducing the infectious titer of the virus in
the culture of Vero cells E6 according to PCR RNA SARS-CoV-2, determined by
the threshold of the number of reaction cycles (cycle treshold, Ct) in various
dilutions of the study drug.
The study of SARS-CoV-2 RNA by PCR was carried out by taking 200 μl of
the supernatant from wells with drug dilutions, isolating RNA in parallel with

positive and negative controls. The result of the study was the conclusion about the
presence / absence of SARS-CoV-2 RNA in the culture liquid when exposed to the
drug: the presence of SARS-CoV-2 RNA (Ct value more than 0), the absence of
SARS-CoV-2 RNA (Ct value is absent).
Results and discussion.
Evaluation of the cytotoxicity of the drug at various concentrations was
determined by incubating the drug with Vero E6 cells for 96 hours using the MTS
dye and visual assessment of the cell monolayer. Based on the data obtained in the
study of the cytotoxic effect of the test substance using MTS in the culture of Vero
E6 cells, an analytical curve was constructed, from which the CC50 was
determined.
Determination of the cytotoxicity of the antisense oligonucleotide substance
by visual assessment of the state of the monolayer of the Vero E6 cell culture
under an inverted microscope did not reveal significant changes in the morphology
of cells at a substance concentration of 2 mg/ml and below after 96 hours of
incubation of the preparation with cells (table 3).

Determination of the antiviral efficacy of the antisense oligonucleotide
according to the treatment scheme (administration of the drug 24 hours after
infection) was taken into account by the decrease in the infectious titer of the virus
in the culture of Vero E6 cells by the cytopathic effect. According to the results of
the study, it was found that the drug did not inhibit the replication of the SARSCoV-2 virus in the Vero E6 cell culture at the tested concentrations.
The results of the study of the antiviral activity of the drug by PCR are

It can be seen from the presented data that there are no statistically
significant differences between the Ct value of the virus control group and the
threshold number of cycles in the samples with the addition of the drug. The only
difference is the Ct value of the group with the addition of the drug at a dosage of
1.0 mg/ml, where the Ct value is 13.8 compared to the virus control group (11.4 10.1).
In the course of research, it was found that the antisense oligonucleotide is
low toxic to the culture of Vero E6 cells. The 50% cytotoxic dose of CC 50 was
greater than 2.0 mg/ml (exact cytotoxic dose values not determined). At the same
time, the results of visual determination of cytotoxicity of the preparations (CC 50)
were comparable to the results of determination of СС 50 using the vital dye MTS.
Thus, this preparation is low toxic and safe for use.

Thus, this preparation is low toxic and safe for use.
As a result of the study of the effectiveness of antisense oligonucleotide in in
vitro experiments against SARS-CoV-2, no statistically significant antiviral effect
was found in the therapeutic regimen of the drug addition, because according to (4)
the minimum effective virus inhibiting concentration is the concentration of the
drug reducing the virus titer by at least 1.5 lg.
At the same time, as a result of studying the RNA content of the virus at
various dosages, it was found that with a dosage of the preparation of 0.001-0.1
mg/ml, the parameter Ct is the number of amplification reaction cycles (doubling
of viral RNA), which is necessary to achieve a fluorescent signal is 10.3-11.2
doubling cycles. Control Ct values in the test with infected cells without the
addition of antisense oligonucleotide were 11.4 - 10.1 values. At a dosage of the
same preparation of 1 mg/ml, the Ct value was 13.8. This means that at a dosage of
1 mg/ml to achieve a fluorescent signal equivalent to the control group, it was
necessary to increase the number of amplification cycles by an average of 2.4-3.7
cycles. This indicates that the dosage of the preparation in 1 mg/ml did not inhibit
the full reproduction of the virus, but significantly reduced viral RNA replication.
The reduction of virus replication based on the calculation of additional
amplification cycles [7] was a range of 5.3 - 13.0 times (22.4 - 23.7). That is, at a

dosage of 1 mg/ml of the preparation, the viral load of cells can be reduced by 5.313 times.
This value cannot be considered statistically significant, but there is a
tendency to reduce the viral load, which may also be effective in antiviral therapy.
Literature data and data obtained in the experiment indicate that the search
for antiviral drugs among groups of antisense oligonucleotides against a new
coronavirus infection COVID-19 is a promising direction. A possible way to
enhance the antiviral effect can be the use of conjugates of oligonucleotides with
other ligands or the use of liposomal forms of drug administration to improve drug
penetration into cells.
For preclinical and clinical studies of antiviral activity, as well as for
therapeutic and prophylactic measures, phosphorothioate protection can be used, as
the simplest and cheapest in synthesis. Other protected group methods are possible
though.
Considering that the virus spreads by airborne dust and airborne droplets,
and affects the epithelium of the respiratory tract and lungs, inhalation of a solution
of drugs through a nebulizer can be a promising and convenient method of
administration. Inhalation of the drug solution through a nebulizer is very simple,
does not require sterilization, it reaches the epithelium of the respiratory system in
a targeted manner, and is possible even in very severe patients. When antisense
oligonucleotides are administered by inhalation, the penetration into the systemic
circulation is less than 1% [12].
The estimated human dosage is calculated based on the following
considerations:
The SARS-CoV-2 (Covid-19) virus is a coronavirus infection that affects the
epithelium of the respiratory tract and lungs. Theoretically, any cell can be
infected, in which up to 100 thousand viral particles can multiply, each of which
can infect another cell [2]. The total area of the lungs and respiratory tract is, on
average, 100 m2 (108 mm2). The surface density of alveolocytes per 1 mm2 is
approximately 10 thousand cells (104).
Thus, the total number of cells in the lungs and respiratory tract is 10 12 cells.
If we assume that all cells are infected (100,000 viral particles) and 1 drug
molecule is needed for each viral RNA, the total number of drug molecules per
dose per adult is 1017, or 16 nmol (102 μg).
A review of antisense oligonucleotides showed that the toxicity of this group
of drugs is represented by two types. The first of them - hybridization-dependent
toxicity - due to the specific sequence of the oligonucleotide and possible crosslinking with RNA, which is not a drug target due to complete or partial
coincidence of the nucleotide sequence with the target, as well as possible aptamer

bioRxiv preprint doi: https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.11.02.363598; this version posted November 3, 2020. The copyright holder for this

binding to proteins [12]. Overcoming this type of toxicity is possible through the
proper selection of the target RNA, using careful bioinformatics analysis to
identify a target with perfect structural match or a small number of mismatched
bases.
This analysis is performed in the preparatory phase by BLAST analysis of
the blocked sequence with sequences of other genes published in GenBank
(NCBI).
The second type of toxicity is hybridization-independent (nonspecific)
toxicity, due to the chemical properties of oligonucleotides interacting with
proteins and their decay products. This type of toxicity does not depend on the
nucleotide sequence, only on the chemical modification of the sugar-phosphate
bridge.
From this provision, it follows that if the nucleotide sequence of the
antisense preparation is correctly selected for the nucleotide sequence of the virus
(coronavirus, influenza virus and other RNA viruses), there is no possible
coincidence with other genes (according to BLAST analysis), then toxicity and
associated with it, side effects / contraindications will depend only on the chemical
modification of the antisense drug, regardless of the nucleotide sequence and the
type of inhibited virus.
This gives the broadest prospects for the creation of antiviral drugs, not only
for coronaviruses, but also for other RNA viruses, such as influenza. In this case, it
will be sufficient to determine in advance the nonspecific toxicity of the
oligonucleotide with the selected protection of the sugar-phosphate backbone.
When sequencing the genome of the desired virus, it will be possible to use
antisense oligonucleotides as medicinal antiviral agents with accelerated toxicity
testing as a kind of off-lable drugs.
This, among other things, will provide an opportunity to quickly respond to
the threat of the next epidemic as a result of the spontaneous penetration of the
virus into the human population, or with the targeted use of the engineered
chimeric virus as a weapon or a means of terrorist attack.
Conclusions.
1. A study of literature data has shown the promise of using antisense
oligonucleotides in the treatment of viral diseases and, in particular, caused by
coronaviruses, such as SARS-CoV and MERS.
2. Oligonucleotides previously studied for SARS (10) are complementary to
the nucleotide sequences of the viral RNA of the new coronavirus infection
COVID-19 in almost all samples and, theoretically, can be considered as drugs for
the treatment of the new coronavirus infection COVID-19.
