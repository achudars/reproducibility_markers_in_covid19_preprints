ABSTRACT

In December 2019, an outbreak of atypical pneumonia (Coronavirus disease 2019 COVID-19) associated with a novel coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) was reported in Wuhan city,
Hubei province, China. The outbreak was traced to a seafood wholesale market and human
to human transmission was confirmed. The rapid spread and the death toll of the new epidemic
warrants immediate intervention. The intra-host genomic variability of SARS-CoV-2 plays a
pivotal role in the development of effective antiviral agents and vaccines, but also in the design
of accurate diagnostics.
We analyzed NGS data derived from clinical samples of three Chinese patients
infected with SARS-CoV-2, in order to identify small- and large-scale intra-host variations in
the viral genome. We identified tens of low- or higher- frequency single nucleotide variations
(SNVs) with variable density across the viral genome, affecting 7 out of 10 protein-coding viral
genes. The majority of these SNVs corresponded to missense changes. The annotation of the
identified SNVs but also of all currently circulating strain variations revealed colocalization of
intra-host but also strain specific SNVs with primers and probes currently used in molecular
diagnostics assays. Moreover, we de-novo assembled the viral genome, in order to isolate
and validate intra-host structural variations and recombination breakpoints. The bioinformatics
analysis disclosed genomic rearrangements over poly-A / poly-U regions located in ORF1ab
and spike (S) gene, including a potential recombination hot-spot within S gene.
Our results highlight the intra-host genomic diversity and plasticity of SARS-CoV-2,
pointing out genomic regions that are prone to alterations. The isolated SNVs and genomic
rearrangements, reflect the intra-patient capacity of the polymorphic quasispecies, which may
arise rapidly during the outbreak, allowing immunological escape of the virus, offering
resistance to anti-viral drugs and affecting the sensitivity of the molecular diagnostics assays.

INTRODUCTION
Coronaviruses (CoVs), considered to be the largest group of viruses, belong to the
Nidovirales order, Coronaviridae family and Coronavirinae subfamily, which is further
subdivided into four genera, the alpha- and betacoronaviruses, which infect mammalian
species and gamma- and deltacoronaviruses infecting mainly birds [1], [2]. Small mammals
(mice, dogs, cats) serve as reservoirs for HCoVs, with significant diversity seen in bats, which
are considered to be primordial hosts of HCoVs [3]. On the contrary, peridomestic animals are
usually intermediate hosts, who enable long-term establishment of endemicity of the viruses,
facilitating mutations and recombination events [1], [4].
Until 2002, minor consideration was given to HCoVs, as they were associated with
mild-to-severe disease phenotypes in immunocompetent people [3]–[5]. In 2002, the
beginning of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) outbreak took place [6]. In 2005, after
the discovery of SARS-CoV-related viruses in horseshoe bats (Rhinolophus), palm civets
were suggested as intermediate hosts, and bats as primordial hosts of the virus [6], [7]. In
2012, the emerging Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) caused an
outbreak in Saudi Arabia, which affected both camels and humans (44% mortality).
On December 31st – 2019, a novel Coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) was first reported from
the city of Wuhan, Hubei province in China, causing severe infection of the respiratory tract in
humans, after the identification of a group of similar cases of patients with pneumonia of
unknown etiology [8] (https://www.who.int/emergencies/diseases/novel-coronavirus-2019).
Similarly to SARS, epidemiological links between the majority of 2019-nCoV cases and
Huanan South China Seafood Market, a live-animal market, have been reported. A total of
76,775 confirmed cases of “Coronavirus Disease 2019” (COVID-19) were reported up to
February 21st 2020, from which 2,247 died and 18,855 recovered. Notably, 75,447 of the
confirmed cases were reported in China (https://www.gisaid.org/epiflu-applications/globalcases-betacov/).
The size of the ssRNA genome of SARS-CoV-2 is 29,891 nucleotides, it encodes 9860
amino acids and is characterized by nucleotide identity of ~ 89% with bat SARS-related-CoV

SL-ZXC21 and ~ 82% with human SARS-CoVs BJ01 2003 and Tor2 [9]. CoVs are enveloped
positive-sense RNA viruses, which are characterized by a very large non-segmented RNA
genome (26 to 32kb length), ready to be translated [2], [5]. The genes arrangement on the
SARS-CoV-2 genome is: 5′UTR -replicase (ORF1/ab) -Spike (S) -ORF3a -Envelope (E) Membrane (M) -ORF6 -ORF7a -ORF8 -Nucleocapsid (N) ORF10 -3′UTR [9]. The main
difference between SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV is in ORF3b, ORF8 and Spike.
Intra host variability of pathogenic viruses and bacteria represents a significant barrier
in the control of infectious diseases. In viral infections, this variation emerges from genomic
phenomena taking place during error-prone replication, ending up to multiple circulating
quasispecies of low or higher frequency [10], [11]. These variants, in combination with the
genetic profile of the host, can potentially influence the natural history of the infection, the viral
phenotype, but also the sensitivity of molecular and serological diagnostics assays [12], [13].
Importantly, intra-host genomic variability leads to antigenic variability, which is of higher
importance, especially for pathogens that fail to elicit long-lasting immunity in their hosts, and
remains a major contributor to the complexity of vaccine design [14], [15]. To date, there are
no clinically approved vaccines available for protection of general population from SARS- and
MERS-CoV infections as there is no effective vaccine to induce robust cell mediated and
humoral immune responses [16], [17].
Here, we explore intra-host genomic variants and low-frequency polymorphic
quasispecies in Next Generation Sequencing (NGS) data derived from patients infected by
SARS-CoV-2. Our analyses provide insights into the intra-patient pool of viral genomes,
identify the frequency levels of rare variants and highlight variable genomic regions and a
potential recombination hot-spot within S gene. Intra-host genomic variability is critical for the
development of novel drugs and vaccines, which are of urgent necessity, towards the
containment of this newly emerging epidemic.

MATERIALS AND METHODS

In this study we analysed NGS data derived from clinical specimens (oral swabs) from
three Chinese patients infected by SARS-CoV-2 (SRA projects PRJNA601736 and
PRJNA603194). We aligned the raw read data on reference strain MN975262.1 using bowtie2
[18], after quality check with FastQC (www.bioinformatics.bbsrc.ac.uk/projects/fastqc). The
resulting alignments were visualized with the Integrated Genomics Viewer (IGV) [19]. After
removing PCR duplicates, SNVs were called with a Bonferroni-corrected P-value threshold of
0.05 using samtools [20] and LoFreq [21]. Variants supported by absolute read concordance
(>98%) were filtered-out from intra-host variant frequency calculations. We annotated the
variations to the reference strain using snpEff [22], SNVs effects were further filtered with
snpSift [23] and we estimated the average mutation rate per gene across the viral genome
using R scripts. We compared the localization of the intra-host SNVs with all available SNVs
observed at population level up to February 18th 2020 (retrieved from www.GISAID.org). We
also compared all intra-host and population level SNPs with all primers and probes
coordinates to investigate for potential interferences with currently available molecular
diagnostic assays [24](www.who.int/docs/default-source/coronaviruse/peiris-protocol-16-120.pdf).
To investigate intra-host genomic rearrangements, we performed de novo assembly
of the SARS-CoV-2 genomes using Spades [25], and the resulting contigs were analyzed with
BLAST [26] and confirmed by remapping of the raw reads. Smaller contigs (<200 bp) were
elongated where possible, after pair-wise realignment of the corresponding mapped reads.
Basic computations and visualizations we implemented in R programming language R version
3.6.2, using in-house scripts. The secondary structures of the genomic regions surrounding
the recombination breakpoints was predicted using RNAfold [27].

RESULTS
The mapping assembly of the viral genome was almost complete for all samples. The
genome coverage and the average read depth across the genome was 99.99% and 133.5x
for sample SRR10903401, 99.99% and 522.5x for sample SRR10903402, and 99.94%, and
598.2x for sample SRR10971381, respectively. The alignment statistics for all samples are
summarized in Suppl.Table 1.
In all cases we isolated the same 5 SNVs with 98-100% read concordance, thus in
total divergence with the reference strain (MN975262.1), which were excluded from the
downstream analysis. For sample SRR10903401 we isolated 34 lower frequency SNVs in
total. Off these, 33 were present with frequencies ranking between 2 and 15%, while only one
was present in 40% of the intra-host viral population. The sequencing depth, which is also
evaluated during the SNV calling by the LoFreq algorithm, ranked between 39x and 290x at
the corresponding SNV positions. The sequencing depth of sample SRR10903402 at the
polymorphic positions was substantially higher (103x – 1137x), allowing the isolation of 55
SNVs with frequencies distributed between 0.9% and 14%. The depth over the polymorphic
positions of sample SRR10971381 was between 159x – 1872x, allowing the isolation of 10
intra-host SNVs, with frequencies 1.1% - 6.8% (Figure 1.A, Suppl.Table 2).
Intra-host variants were distributed across 7 out of the 10 protein-coding genes of the
viral genome, namely ORF1ab, S, ORF3a, ORF6, ORF7a, ORF8 and N. After normalising for
the gene length (variants / kb-gene-length – “v/kbgl”), the higher density was observed in the
small ORF6 (16.21 v/kbgl), followed by ORF8 (8.21 v/kbgl), N (4.76 v/kbgl), S (4.18 v/kbgl),
ORF1ab (3.47 v/kbgl), ORF7a (2.73 v/kbgl) and ORF3a (1.21 v/kbgl). Interestingly, the
majority of the SNPs corresponded to missense changes (leading to amino-acid change)
compared to synonymous changes (72 vs. 29 respectively, ratio 2.48:1) (Table 1). The
average intra-host variant frequency did not differ substantially either between missense and
synonymous polymorphisms (Figure 1.C), neither between their hosting genes (Figure 1.D).
We did not detect any small-scale insertions or deletions in the samples (Suppl. Table 2).

The comparison of all SNVs (intra-host and population level) with the genomic targets
of the molecular diagnostics assays, revealed colocalizations of three intra-host SNVs and 2
isolate-specific SNVs with primers and probes currently in use. In detail, intra-host SNVs
colocalized with the probe of RdRP_SARSr reaction (15,474 T > G), with the reverse primer
of HKU-N reaction (28,971 A > G) and with the probe of 2019-nCoV-N2 reaction (29,095 T >
C). More importantly, two SNVs belonging to isolates Wuhan/IVD-HB-04/2020 and
Chongqing/YC01/2020, colocalized with the forward primer of 2019-nCoV-N1 reaction (28,291
C > T) and the probe of 2019nCoV-N2 reaction (29,200 C > T), respectively (Figure 2).
The de novo assembly of the viral genomes revealed intra-host genomic
rearrangements. For samples SRR10903401 and SRR10903402, these large-scale structural
events were systematically observed over poly-A / poly-U-rich genomic regions, located in
ORF1ab and S genes. In all cases, similar or identical strings of nucleotides in close proximity
appear to have served as seeds for homologous recombination events. All rearrangements
were validated by remapping of the raw reads on the corresponding de novo assembled
contigs, setting a threshold of at least 5 supporting reads of high mapping quality (>40) in each
case. For sample SRR10903401 we isolated three inversions/misassemblies in ORF1ab
(Suppl. Figure 2) and one inversion/misassembly in S gene (Figure 3-A). Notably, we were
able to validate the same inversion in S gene for sample SRR10903402 as well (Figure 3-B).
Apart from 2 inversions in ORF1ab supported by only 2 reads each (not passing the validation
threshold), there were no further large-scale intra-host events observed for sample
SRR10903402. Similarly, we identified one inversion/misassembly in sample SRR10971381
that was supported by only one read. The alignment coordinates of all rearrangementsupporting contigs with respect to the reference strain are presented in (Table 2).

DISCUSSION

The rapid spread and the death toll of the new SARS-CoV-2 epidemic warrants the
immediate identification / development of effective antiviral agents and vaccines, but also the
design of accurate diagnostics. The intra- and inter- patient variability of the viral genome plays
a pivotal role in all the abovementioned efforts, since it affects the compatibility of molecular
diagnostics but also impairs the effectiveness of the vaccines and the serological assays by
altering the antigenicity of the virus. Intra-host low-frequency variants are also the main source
of resistance to anti-viral drugs.
Bioinformatics analysis of NGS data allows the generation of the consensus sequence
of a viral genome from the of majority nucleotides at each position but also the identification
of non-consensus nucleotides, enabling the exploration of intra-host variability but also its
consequences on intra-host viral evolution [28]–[30]. All samples analysed in this study were
probably infected by the same viral strain since they shared the same set of consensus SNVs.
However, apart from 3 intra-host SNVs that were common between SRR10903401 and
SRR10903402, there was no other overlap observed between the low frequency variants of
each sample (Figure 1-B). This indicates that these variations have been occurred in a rather
random fashion and are not subject of selective pressures, which is also supported by the fact
that the missense mutations were systematically more, compared to the synonymous
mutations. On the other hand, missense substitutions are more common in loci involving
pathogen resistance, indicating positive selection [31]. The analysed viral RNA might have
been originated from functional/packed virions, but also from unpacked viral genomes, which
are unable to replicate and infect other host cells. Even if a viral genome is unable to replicate
independently, its abundant presence in the pool of viral quasispecies implies some
functionality regarding the intra-host evolution and adaptation. For example, defective viral
genomes might affect infection dynamics such as viral persistence but also the natural history
of an infection [32]–[34]. At the same time, these variants may arise rapidly during an outbreak
and can be used for tracking the transmission chains and the spaciotemporal characteristics

of the epidemic [35]–[37]. Studies involving large number of samples and in-vitro experiments
on SARS-CoV-2 viral isolates are needed, in order to conclude whether these variations are
advantageous or come with a fitness cost for the virus.
SNVs and quasispecies that are observed at low frequency could represent viral
variations of low impact on the functionality of the genome. However, their abundance is
largely affected by the population size and the epidemic characteristics. For example, a neutral
substitution in a region that represents a primer target for a molecular diagnostic assay can
drift to fixation rather quickly in a rapidly spreading virus, jeopardizing the sensitivity of the
assay [38], [39]. Here, we highlight three intra-host but also two fixed variants that colocalized
with primers or probes of real-time PCR diagnostics assays that are currently in use (Figure
2). Since the alignment of these oligos with their genomic targets is directly linked to the
performance of the corresponding diagnostic assays, the community should pay extra
attention in the evaluation of these potentially emerging variations and be alerted, in case
redesigning of these oligos is needed.
As it is well documented, recombination events lead to substantial changes in genetic
diversity of RNA viruses [40], [41]. In CoVs, discontinuous RNA synthesis is commonly
observed, resulting in high frequencies of homologous recombination [42], which can be up to
25% across the entire CoV genome [43]. For pathogenic HCoVs genomic rearrangements are
frequently reported during the course of epidemic outbreaks, such as HCoV-OC43 [44], and
HCoV-NL63 [45], SARS-CoV [46][44] and MERS-CoV [47]. We have isolated intra-host
genomic rearrangements, located in poly-A and poly-U enriched palindrome regions across
the SARS-CoV-2 genome (Figure 3, Suppl. Figure 1). We have validated the majority of
these events by visual inspection of the alignments. We conclude that these rearrangements
do not represent artifacts derived from the NGS library preparation (e.g. PCR crosstalk
artifacts), especially since all the supporting reads were not duplicated and, in some cases,
differed in polymorphic positions (Suppl. Figure 2).
Recombination processes involving S gene particularly, have been reported for SARSand SARS-like CoV but also for HCoV-OC43. In the case of sister species HCoV-NL63 and

HCoV-229E, recombination breakpoints are located near 3’- and 5’-end of the gene [1][47]. S
is a trimeric protein, which is cleaved into two subunits, the globular N-terminal S1 and the Cterminal S2 [48]. The S1 subunit consists of a signal peptide and the NT and receptor binding
(RB) domains, with the latter sharing only 40% amino acid identity with other SARS-related
CoVs. Our analysis revealed that similarly to other genomic regions, the S1 subunit hosts
many low-frequency SNVs, characterized by higher density compared to the rest of the S gene
sequence (Figure 1-E). The S2 subunit is highly conserved, with 99% identity compared to
human SARS-CoV and two bat SARS-like CoVs [9]. The S2 subunit consists of two fusion
peptides (FP, IFP), followed by two heptad repeats (HR 1 and 2), the pretransmembrane
domain (PTM), the transmembrane and the cytoplasmic domain (TM, CP) [48]. In S gene, the
same rearrangement event has taken place in two samples analyzed in this study. This
observation highlights a potential recombination hot-spot in S gene. The rearrangement that
was common between the two samples of this study is located in nt24,000 of the 2019-nCoV
genome, which corresponds to the ~200nt linking region between the fusion peptides FP and
IFP (aa 812-813). Examining closely the secondary structure of the RNA genome around the
breakpoints, we suggest a model where the palindromes 5’-UGGUUUU-3’ and 5’AAAACCAA-3’, have served as donor-acceptor sequences during the recombination event,
since they are both exposed in the single-stranded internal loops formed in a highly structured
RNA pseudoknot (Figure 3-C). The RB domain of the S protein has been tested as a potential
immunogen as it contains neutralization epitopes which appear to have a role in the induction
of neutralizing antibodies [16], [49]. It should be mentioned though that S protein of SARSCoV is the most divergent in all strains infecting humans [50], [51] , as in both C and N-terminal
domains variations arise rapidly, allowing immunological escape [52]. Our findings support
that apart from these variations, the N-terminal region also hosts a recombination hot-spot,
which together with the rest of the observed rearrangements, indicates the genomic instability
of SARS-CoV-2 over poly-A and poly-U regions.
