Abstract

37

To contain the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic, a safe and effective vaccine

38

against the new severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) is urgently

39

needed in quantities sufficient to immunise large populations. In this study, we report the

40

design, preclinical development, immunogenicity and anti-viral protective effect in rhesus

41

macaques of the BNT162b2 vaccine candidate. BNT162b2 contains an LNP-formulated

42

nucleoside-modified mRNA that encodes the spike glycoprotein captured in its prefusion

43

conformation. After expression of the BNT162b2 coding sequence in cells, approximately 20%

44

of the spike molecules are in the one-RBD ‘up’, two-RBD ‘down’ state. Immunisation of mice

45

with a single dose of BNT162b2 induced dose level-dependent increases in pseudovirus

46

neutralisation titers. Prime-boost vaccination of rhesus macaques elicited authentic SARS-

47

CoV-2 neutralising geometric mean titers 10.2 to 18.0 times that of a SARS-CoV-2

48

convalescent human serum panel. BNT162b2 generated strong TH1 type CD4+ and IFNγ+ CD8+

49

T-cell responses in mice and rhesus macaques. The BNT162b2 vaccine candidate fully

50

protected the lungs of immunised rhesus macaques from infectious SARS-CoV-2 challenge.

51

BNT162b2 is currently being evaluated in a global, pivotal Phase 2/3 trial (NCT04368728).

Introduction

54

Due to the shattering impact of the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic on human

55

health and society, multiple collaborative research programs have been launched, leading to

56

new insights and progress towards vaccine development. Soon after it emerged in December

57

2019, severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) was identified as a β-

58

coronavirus with high sequence similarity to bat-derived SARS-like coronaviruses1,2. The

59

globalised response is mirrored by the upload of over 92,000 viral genome sequences as of

60

August 29, 2020, to GISAID (Global Initiative on Sharing All Influenza Data).

61

The trimeric spike glycoprotein (S) of SARS-CoV-2 binds its cellular receptor, angiotensin

62

converting enzyme 2 (ACE2), through a receptor-binding domain (RBD), which is part of its

63

N-terminal furin cleavage fragment (S1)3,4. S rearranges to translocate the virus into cells by

64

membrane fusion5,6. The C-terminal furin cleavage fragment (S2) contains the fusion

65

machinery7. Membrane fusion can be blocked by mutating S residues 986 and 987 to prolines,

66

producing an S antigen stabilised in the prefusion conformation (P2 S)8–10. The RBD is a key

67

target for virus neutralising antibodies, with an ’up’ conformation, in which more neutralising

68

epitopes are exposed, and a ‘down’ conformation in which many epitopes are buried5,10–12. In

69

addition, some neutralising antibodies bind S epitopes outside the RBD.

70

During this pandemic, fast vaccine availability is critical. COVID-19 vaccine candidates based

71

on different platforms are already in clinical trials, with the most advanced based on viral vector

72

and nucleic acid technologies13–16. We report the preclinical development of BNT162b2, a lipid-

73

nanoparticle (LNP) formulated N1-methyl-pseudouridine (m1Ψ) nucleoside-modified mRNA

74

(modRNA) vaccine candidate that encodes P2 S with a native furin cleavage site resulting in

75

the S1 and S2 cleavage fragments (Fig. 1a). The m1Ψ-modification dampens innate immune

76

sensing, and, together with optimised non-coding sequence elements, increases RNA

77

translation in vivo17–19. ModRNA vaccines have already proven immunogenic for several viral

78

targets20,21. BNT162b2 has been evaluated in phase 1 clinical trials in the US (NCT04368728)

79

and Germany (NCT04380701, EudraCT: 2020-001038-36), and is now being evaluated in a

80

pivotal, global, phase 2/3 safety and efficacy study15.

Results

82

BNT162b2 RNA in vitro transcribed by T7 polymerase from a plasmid DNA template has a

83

single, sharp-peak microfluidic capillary electrophoresis profile, consistent with its calculated

84

length of 4,283 nucleotides, indicating purity and integrity (Fig. 1b). When HEK293T/17 cells

85

were incubated with BNT162b2 (which is LNP-formulated) or with BNT162b2 RNA mixed

86

with a transfection reagent, robust expression of P2 S was detectable by flow cytometry

87

(Extended Data Fig. 1a).

88

For structural characterisation, P2 S was expressed in Expi293F cells from DNA that encodes

89

the same amino acid sequence as BNT162b2 RNA, with the addition of a C-terminal TwinStrep

90

tag for affinity purification. The trimeric P2 S bound the human ACE2 peptidase domain (PD),

91

and an anti-RBD human neutralising antibody B38 with high affinity (KD 1 nM, Extended Data

92

Fig. 1b,c)22. Structural analysis by cryo-electron microscopy (cyro-EM) produced a 3.29 Å

93

nominal resolution mass density map, into which a previously published atomic model10 was

94

fitted and rebuilt (Fig. 1c,d; Extended Data Fig. 2, Extended Data Table 1). The rebuilt model

95

shows good agreement with reported structures of prefusion full-length wild type S and its

96

ectodomain with P2 mutations5,10. Three-dimensional classification of the dataset showed a

97

class of particles that was in the one RBD ‘up’ (accessible for receptor binding), two RBD

98

‘down’ (closed) conformation and represented 20.4% of the trimeric molecules. The remainder

99

were in the all RBD ‘down’ conformation (Fig. 1e, Extended Data Fig. 2c). The RBD in the

100

‘up’ conformation was less well resolved than other parts of the structure, suggesting

101

conformational flexibility and a dynamic equilibrium between RBD ‘up’ and RBD ‘down’

102

states as also suggested by others5,23. Nevertheless, the binding and structural analyses indicate

103

that the BNT162b2 RNA sequence encodes a recombinant P2 S that authentically presents the

104

ACE2 binding site and other epitopes targeted by SARS-CoV-2 neutralising antibodies.

105

To characterise BNT162b2-elicited B- and T-cell responses, BALB/c mice were immunized

106

intramuscularly (IM) once with 0.2, 1, or 5 µg BNT162b2 or received a buffer control. S1- and

107

RBD-binding serum IgG developed rapidly at all dose levels in a dose-dependent manner. For

108

S1-binding antibodies, the geometric mean concentration (GMC) in the 5 µg group was 386

109

µg/mL at Day 28 (Fig. 2a, Extended Data Fig. 3a). At Day 28 after immunisation, vaccine-

110

elicited IgG had a strong binding affinity for S1 (geometric mean KD 12 nM) and the RBD

111

(geometric mean KD 0.99 nM), with both having a low off-rate (Extended Data Fig. 3b). SARS-

112

CoV-2 neutralising activity in mouse serum was measured by a vesicular stomatitis virus

113

(VSV)-based SARS-CoV-2 pseudovirus neutralisation assay. Fifty percent pseudovirus

114

neutralisation geometric mean titers (pVNT50 GMTs) increased steadily after immunisation to

115

26, 176, and 296 on Day 28 for the 0.2, 1, and 5 µg dose levels, respectively (Fig. 2b, Extended

116

Data Fig. 3c).

117

A high fraction of splenocytes of CD4+ and CD8+ T-cell phenotype isolated from mice on Days

118

12 and 28 after BNT162b2-immunisation had a strong antigen-specific IFNγ and IL-2 response

119

in ELISpot and intracellular cytokine staining flow cytometry analysis when re-stimulated ex

120

vivo with a full-length S peptide pool (Fig. 2c-e). Total splenocytes harvested on Day 28 and

121

ex vivo re-stimulated with the full-length S peptide pool secreted high levels of the TH1

122

cytokines IL-2 or IFNγ, but minute amounts of the TH2 cytokines IL-4, IL-5 and IL-13 as

123

measured in multiplex immunoassays (Fig. 2f).

124

BNT162b2-induced effects on proliferation and dynamics of immune cell populations were

125

assessed in injection site draining lymph nodes (dLNs), which are the principal immune-

126

educated compartments for proficient T- and B-cell priming, and in blood and spleen for

127

evaluation of its systemic effects. Higher numbers of plasma cells, class switched IgG1- and

128

IgG2a-positive B cells, and germinal center B cells were observed in dLNs and spleens of mice

129

12 days after immunisation with 5 µg BNT162b2 than after immunisation with buffer

130

(Extended Data Fig. 4a, b). In Day 7 post-immunisation blood, there were significantly fewer

131

circulating B cells than in blood from buffer-immunised mice (Extended Data Fig. 4c), which

132

may imply that B-cell homing to lymphoid compartments augments B cell counts in dLN and

133

spleen. The dLNs from BNT162b2-immunised mice also have significantly elevated counts of

134

CD8+ and CD4+ T cells, which was most pronounced for T follicular helper (TFH) cells,

135

including ICOS+ subsets essential for germinal center formation (Extended Data Fig. 4a)24.

136

BNT162b2 immunisation increased CD8+ T cell counts in the blood and TFH cell counts in the

137

spleen and blood (Extended Data Fig. 4b, c). These data indicate that BNT162b2 concurrently

138

elicits strong SARS-CoV-2 pseudovirus neutralising titers and systemic TH1-driven CD4+ and

139

CD8+ T-cell responses.

140

To assess BNT162b2-mediated protection in non-human primates, groups of six male, 2-4 year

141

old rhesus macaques were immunised IM with 30 or 100 µg of BNT162b2 or saline control on

142

Days 0 and 21. S1-binding IgG was readily detectable by Day 21 after Dose 1, and levels

143

increased further after Dose 2 through Day 28 (Fig. 3a). Seven days after Dose 2 (Day 28), the

144

GMCs of S1-binding IgG were 30,339 units (U)/mL (30 µg dose level) and 34,668 U/mL

145

(100 µg dose level). For comparison, the S1-binding IgG GMC of a panel of 38 SARS-CoV-2

146

convalescent human sera was 631 U/mL, substantially lower than the GMCs of the immunised

147

rhesus macaques after one or two doses.

148

Fifty percent virus neutralisation GMTs, measured by an authentic SARS-CoV-2 neutralisation

149

assay25, were detectable in rhesus macaque sera by Day 21 after Dose 1 and peaked at a GMT

150

of 962 (Day 35, 14 days after Dose 2 of 30 µg) or 1,689 (Day 28, 7 days after Dose 2 of 100 µg;

151

Fig. 3b). Robust GMTs of 285 for 30 µg and 310 for 100 µg dose levels persisted to at least

152

Day 56 (most recent time point tested). For comparison, the neutralisation GMT of the human

153

convalescent serum panel was 94.

154

S-specific T-cell responses were analysed in BNT162b2-immunised rhesus macaques and

155

saline-immunised controls by ELISpot and intracellular cytokine staining (ICS). Peripheral

156

blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) were collected before immunisation and at the times

157

indicated after Doses 1 and 2. Strong IFNγ but minimal IL-4 responses were detected by

158

ELISpot after Dose 2 (Fig. 3c,d, Extended Data Fig. 5). ICS confirmed that BNT162b2 elicited

159

strong S-specific IFNγ producing T-cell responses, including a high frequency of CD4+ T cells

160

that produced IFNγ, IL-2, and TNF but a low frequency of CD4+ T cells that produced IL-4,

161

indicating a TH1-biased response (Fig. 3e,f). BNT162b2 also elicited S-specific

162

IFNγ+ producing CD8+ T cells (Fig. 3g).

163

Six rhesus macaques that had received two immunisations with 100 µg BNT162b2 and three

164

age-matched macaques that had received saline were challenged 55 days after Dose 2 with

165

1.05 × 106 plaque forming units of SARS-CoV-2 (strain USA-WA1/2020), split equally

166

between intranasal and intratracheal routes, as previously described26. Three additional non-

167

immunised, age-matched rhesus macaques (sentinels) were mock-challenged with cell culture

168

medium. Nasal and oropharyngeal (OP) swabs were collected and bronchoalveolar lavage

169

(BAL) was performed at the times indicated, and samples were tested for SARS-CoV-2 RNA

170

(genomic RNA or subgenomic transcripts) by reverse-transcription quantitative polymerase

171

chain reaction (RT-qPCR; Fig. 4). All personnel performing clinical, radiological,

172

histopathological, or RT-qPCR evaluations were blinded to the group assignments of the

173

macaques.

174

Viral RNA was detected in BAL fluid from 2 of the 3 control-immunised macaques on Day 3

175

after challenge and from 1 of 3 on Day 6 (Fig. 4a). At no time point sampled was viral RNA

176

detected in BAL fluid from the BNT162b2-immunised and SARS-CoV-2 challenged macaques

177

(Fig. 4a). The difference in viral RNA detection in BAL fluid between BNT162b2-immunised

178

and control-immunised rhesus macaques after challenge is highly statistically significant (by a

179

nonparametric test, p=0.0014).

180

From control-immunised macaques, viral RNA was detected in nasal swabs obtained on Days

181

1, 3, and 6 after SARS-CoV-2 challenge; from BNT162b2-immunised macaques, viral RNA

182

was detected only in nasal swabs obtained on Day 1 after challenge and not in swabs obtained

183

on Day 3 or subsequently (Fig. 4b). The pattern of viral RNA detection from OP swabs was

184

similar to that for nasal swabs (Fig. 4c).

185

In general, virus-challenged animals showed no clinical signs of significant disease. We

186

conclude that the 2-4 year old male rhesus macaque challenge model is primarily a SARS-CoV-

187

2 infection model and not a COVID-19 disease model.

188

Discussion

189

We demonstrate that BNT162b2, an LNP-formulated, m1Ψ nucleoside-modified mRNA

190

encoding SARS-CoV-2 S captured in a prefusion conformation is highly immunogenic in mice

191

and rhesus macaques. Expression from DNA of protein with the BNT162b2-encoded amino

192

acid sequence confirmed the P2 S prefusion conformation by cryo-EM. This analysis confirmed

193

that the antigenically important RBD can assume the ‘up’ conformation, with the receptor

194

binding site, rich in neutralising epitopes, accessible in a proportion of the molecules27. The

195

alternative states observed likely reflect a dynamic equilibrium between RBD ‘up’ and ‘down’

196

positions10,23. Binding of expressed and purified P2 S to ACE2 and a neutralising monoclonal

197

antibody further demonstrates its conformational and antigenic integrity.

198

In mice, a single injection of BNT162b2 elicited high neutralizing titers and strong TH1 and TFH

199

type CD4+ and IFNγ+IL-2+ CD8+ T-cell responses. Both BNT162b2 induced CD4+ T-cell types

200

may support antigen-specific antibody generation and maturation, and potentially protection

201

from infectious challenge. Limitation and clearance of virus infection is promoted by the

202

interplay of neutralising antibodies with CD8+ T cells that eliminate intracellular virus

203

reservoirs. CD8+ T cells may also reduce the influx of monocytes into infected lung tissue,

204

which can be associated with undesirable IL-6 and TNF production and impaired antigen

205

presentation28,29. The contributions of the immune effector systems to human protection from

206

SARS-CoV-2 is not yet understood. Therefore, it appears prudent to develop COVID-19

207

vaccines that enlist concomitant cognate B cell, CD4+ T cell, and CD8+ T-cell responses.

208

The immunogenicity of BNT162b2 in rhesus macaques paralleled its immunogenicity in mice.

209

Seven days after Dose 2 of 100 µg, the neutralising GMT reached 18-times that of a human

210

SARS-CoV-2 convalescent serum panel and remained 3.3-times higher than this benchmark

211

five weeks after the last immunisation. The strongly TH1-biased CD4+ T-cell response and

212

IFNγ+ CD8+ T-cell response to BNT162b2 is a pattern favoured for vaccine safety and efficacy,

213

providing added reassurance for clinical translation30. BNT162b2 protected 2-4 year old rhesus

214

macaques from infectious SARS-CoV-2 challenge, with reduced detection of viral RNA in

215

immunised animals compared to those that received saline and with no evidence of clinical

216

exacerbation. Strong RT-qPCR evidence for lower respiratory tract protection was

217

demonstrated by the absence of detectable SARS-CoV-2 RNA in serial BAL samples obtained

218

starting 3 days after challenge of BNT162b2-immunised rhesus macaques.

219

We recently presented data from immunisation with BNT162b1, a vaccine candidate that has

220

the same LNP-formulated m1Ψ nucleoside-modified RNA platform but expresses a trimerised,

221

secreted RBD (Vogel et al., manuscript in preparation). The pattern, magnitude and durability

222

of humoral and cellular responses to BNT162b1 in mice and macaques were in the range of

223

those elicited by BNT162b2, as was protection of macaques from virus challenge, indicating

224

that these features are largely class-intrinsic for this particular vaccine platform. BNT162b1

225

elicits high SARS-CoV-2 neutralizing titers and strong TH1-biased CD4+ and IFNγ+ and IL-2+

226

CD8+ T cell responses in humans, consistent with the preclinical findings15,31,32.

227

The selection of BNT162b2 over BNT162b1 for further clinical testing was largely driven by

228

greater tolerability of BNT162b2 with comparable immunogenicity in clinical trials15 and the

229

broader range of T-cell epitopes on the much larger full length spike. A global, pivotal, phase

230

3 safety and efficacy study of immunisation with BNT162b2 (NCT04368728) is now well

231

under way and may answer those open questions that cannot be addressed by preclinical

232

models.

Human convalescent sera.

263

Human COVID-19 convalescent sera (n=38) were drawn from donors 18-83 years of age at

264

least 14 days after PCR-confirmed diagnosis and at a time when the participants were

265

asymptomatic. Serum donors had symptomatic infections (35/38), or had had been hospitalised

266

(1/38). Sera were obtained from Sanguine Biosciences (Sherman Oaks, CA), the MT group

267

(Van Nuys, CA) and Pfizer Occupational Health and Wellness (Pearl River, NY) and used

268

across different studies as reference benchmark.

269

Cell culture.

270

Human embryonic kidney (HEK)293T/17 and Vero 76 cells (both ATCC) were cultured in

271

Dulbecco’s modified Eagle’s medium (DMEM) with GlutaMAX™ (Gibco) supplemented with

272

10% fetal bovine serum (FBS [Sigma-Aldrich]). Cell lines were tested for mycoplasma

273

contamination after receipt, before expansion and cryopreservation. For studies including NHP

274

samples, Vero 76 and Vero CCL81 (both ATCC) cells were cultured in DMEM (Gibco)

275

containing 2% HyClone fetal bovine and 100 U/mL penicillium/streptomycin (Gibco).

276

Expi293F™ cells were grown in Expi293™ media and transiently transfected using

277

ExpiFectamine™293 (all from Thermo Fisher Scientific).

278

In vitro transcription and purification of RNA.

279

To generate the template for RNA synthesis, a DNA fragment encoding the SARS-CoV-2 P2

280

S protein (based on GenBank: MN908947), including the amino acid exchanges K986P and

281

V987P, was cloned into a starting plasmid vector with backbone sequence elements for

282

improved RNA stability and translational efficiency19,34. Non-coding backbone elements

283

included the regions from the T7 promoter to the 5′ and 3′ UTR plus a poly(A) tail

284

(100 nucleotides) interrupted by a linker (A30LA70, 10 nucleotides). The DNA was purified,

285

spectrophotometrically quantified, and in vitro transcribed by T7 RNA polymerase in the

286

presence of a trinucleotide cap1 analogue ((m27,3’-O)Gppp(m2’-O)ApG; TriLink) and of N1-

287

methylpseudouridine-5’-triphosphate (m1ΨTP; Thermo Fisher Scientific) instead of uridine-

288

5’-triphosphate (UTP)35. RNA was purified using magnetic particles36, integrity assessed by

289

microfluidic capillary electrophoresis (Agilent Fragment Analyser), and concentration, pH,

290

osmolality, endotoxin level and bioburden determined.

291

Lipid-nanoparticle formulation of the RNA.

292

Purified RNA was formulated into LNPs using an ethanolic lipid mixture of ionisable cationic

293

lipid and transferred into an aqueous buffer system via diafiltration to yield an LNP composition

294

similar to one previously described37. BNT162b2 was stored at -70 °C at a concentration of

295

0.5 mg/mL.

296

mRNA transfection and P2 S translation.

297

HEK293T/17 cells were transfected with 1 µg RiboJuice transfection reagent-mixed

298

BNT162b2 RNA or with BNT162b2 (BNT162b2 RNA formulated as LNP) by incubation for

299

18 hours. Non-LNP formulated mRNA was diluted in Opti-MEM medium (Thermo Fisher

300

Scientific) and mixed with the transfection reagents according to the manufacturer’s

301

instructions (RiboJuice, Merck Millipore). Transfected HEK293T/17 cells were stained with

302

Fixable Viability Dye (eBioscience). After fixation (Fixation Buffer, BioLegend), cells were

303

permeabilised (Perm Buffer, eBioscience) and stained with a monoclonal SARS-CoV-2 spike

304

S1 antibody (SinoBiological). Cells were acquired on a FACSCanto II flow cytometer (BD

305

Biosciences) using BD FACSDiva software version 8.0.1 and analysed by FlowJo software

306

version 10.6.2 (FlowJo LLC, BD Biosciences).

307

P2 S expression and purification.

308

To express P2 S for structural characterisation, a gene encoding the full length of SARS-CoV-

309

2 (GenBank: MN908947) with two prolines substituted at residues 986 and 987 followed with

310

a C-terminal HRV3C protease site and a TwinStrep tag was cloned into a modified

311

pcDNA3.1(+) vector with the CAG promoter. The TwinStrep-tagged P2 S was expressed in

312

Expi293 cells. Purification of the recombinant protein was based on a procedure described

313

previously, with minor modifications5. Upon cell lysis, P2 S was solubilized in 1% NP-40

314

detergent. The TwinStrep-tagged protein was then captured with StrepTactin Sepharose HP

315

resin in 0.5% NP-40. P2 S was further purified by size-exclusion chromatography and eluted

316

as three distinct peaks in 0.02 % NP-40 as previously reported5. Peak 1, which consists of intact

317

P2 S migrating at around 150 kDa, as well as dissociated S1 and S2 subunits, which co-migrate

318

at just above 75 kDa, was used in the structural characterisation. Spontaneous dissociation of

319

the S1 and S2 subunits mostly occurs throughout the course of the protein purification, starting

320

at the point of detergent-mediated protein extraction.

322

The binding of detergent NP-40 solubilized, purified P2 S to human ACE2 peptidase domain

323

(ACE2 PD) and human neutralising monoclonal antibody B3822 was performed on Octet

324

RED384 (FortéBio) at 25 ⁰C in a running buffer (RB) consisting of 25 mM Tris pH7.5, 150 mM

325

NaCl, 1 mM EDTA and 0.02% NP-40. Avi-tagged ACE2-PD was captured on streptavidin

326

coated sensors and B38 antibody was captured on sensors coated with protein G. After initial

327

baseline equilibration of 120 s, the sensors were dipped in 10 µg/mL solution of Avi-tagged

328

ACE2-PD or B38 mAb for 300 s to achieve capture levels of 1 nM using the threshold function.

329

The sensors were dipped in RB for 120 s for collecting baseline before they were dipped in a

330

concentration series of purified P2 S samples for 300 s (association phase). The sensors were

331

immersed in RB for measuring 600 s (dissociation phase). Data were reference subtracted and

332

fit to a 1:1 binding model with R2 value greater than 0.95, to determine kinetics and affinity of

333

binding, using Octet Data Analysis Software v10.0 (FortéBio).

334

Cryo-electron microscopy sample preparation, data collection and data processing.

335

For TwinStrep-tagged P2 S, 4 μL purified protein at 0.5 mg/mL were applied to gold Quantifoil

336

R1.2/1.3 300 mesh grids freshly overlaid with graphene oxide. Sample was blotted using a

337

Vitrobot Mark IV for 4 s with a force of -2 before being plunged into liquid ethane cooled by

338

liquid nitrogen. 27,701 micrographs were collected from a two identically prepared grids on a

339

Titan Krios operating at 300 keV equipped with a Gatan K2 Summit direct electron detector in

340

super-resolution mode at a magnification of 165,000x, for a magnified pixel size of 0.435 Å at

341

the specimen level. Data were collected from each grid over a defocus range of -1.2 to -3.4 μm

342

with a total electron dose of 50.32 and 50.12 e-/Å2, respectively, fractionated into 40 frames

343

over a 6-second exposure for 1.26 and 1.25 e-/Å2/frame. On-the-fly motion correction, CTF

344

estimation, and particle picking and extraction with a box size of 450 pixels were performed in

345

Warp38, during which super-resolution data were binned to give a pixel size of 0.87 Å. A total

346

of 1,119,906 particles were extracted. All subsequent processing was performed in RELION

347

3.1-beta39. Particle heterogeneity was filtered out with 2D and 3D classification to filter out bad

348

particles, yielding a set of 73,393 particles, which refined to 3.6 Å with C3 symmetry. 3D

349

classification of this dataset without particle alignment separated out one class with a single

350

RBD up, representing 15,098 particles. The remaining 58,295 particles, in three RBD ‘down’

351

conformation, were refined to give a final model at 3.29 Å. The atomic model from PDB ID

352

6XR85 was rigid-body fitted into the map density, then flexibly fitted to the density using real-

353

space refinement in Phenix40 alternating with manual building in Coot41. The cryo-EM model

358

BNT162b2 was diluted in PBS, 300 mM sucrose or saline (0.9% NaCl) and injected IM into

359

the gastrocnemius muscle at a volume of 20 µL under isoflurane anaesthesia.

360

Rhesus macaques (Macaca mulatta). Male rhesus macaques (2–4 years) were randomly

361

assigned to receive either BNT162b2 or saline placebo control in 0.5 mL volume administered

362

by IM injection in the left quadriceps muscle on Days 0 and 21.

363

Tissue preparation.

364

Mice. Peripheral blood was collected from the retro-orbital venous plexus under isoflurane

365

anaesthesia or vena facialis without prior anesthetisation. Blood was centrifuged for 5 minutes

366

at 16.000 x g, and the serum was immediately used for downstream assays or stored at -20 °C.

367

Spleen single-cell suspensions were prepared in PBS by mashing tissue against the surface of

368

a 70 µm cell strainer (BD Falcon). Erythrocytes were removed by hypotonic lysis. Popliteal,

369

inguinal and iliac lymph nodes were pooled, cut into pieces, digested with collagenase D

370

(1 mg/mL; Roche) and passed through cell strainers.

371

Rhesus macaques (Macaca mulatta). Serum was obtained before immunisation and on Days

372

14, 21, 28, 35, 42, and 56. PBMCs were obtained before immunisation and on Days 7, 28, and

373

42, except that PBMCs were not obtained from the buffer-immunised group on Day 28. Blood

374

for serum and PBMCs was collected in compliance with animal protocol 2017-8725-023

375

approved by the NIRC Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee. Animals were

376

anesthetised with ketamine HCl (10 mg/kg; IM) during blood collection and immunisation, and

377

monitored for adequate sedation.

ImmunoResearch). Data were captured as median fluorescent intensities (MFIs) using a

389

Bioplex200 system (Bio-Rad) and converted to U/mL antibody concentrations using a reference

390

standard consisting of 5 pooled human COVID-19 convalescent serum samples (obtained >14

391

days PCR diagnosis), diluted in antibody depleted human serum with arbitrary assigned

392

concentrations of 100 U/mL and accounting for the serum dilution factor.

393

Binding kinetics of antigen-specific IgGs using surface plasmon resonance spectroscopy

394

Binding kinetics of murine S1- and RBD-specific serum IgGs was determined using a Biacore

395

T200 device (Cytiva) with HBS-EP running buffer (BR100669, Cytiva) at 25 °C. Carboxyl

396

groups on the CM5 sensor chip matrix were activated with a mixture of 1-ethyl-3-(3-

397

dimethylaminopropyl) carbodiimidehydrochloride (EDC) and N-hydroxysuccinimide (NHS) to

398

form active esters for the reaction with amine groups. Anti-mouse-Fc-antibody (Jackson

399

ImmunoResearch) was diluted in 10 mM sodium acetate buffer pH 5 (30 µg/mL) for covalent

400

coupling to immobilisation level of ~10,000 response units (RU). Free N-hydroxysuccinimide

401

esters on the sensor surface were deactivated with ethanolamine.

402

Mouse serum was diluted 1:50 in HBS-EP buffer and applied at 10 µL/min for 30 seconds to

403

the active flow cell for capture by immobilised antibody, while the reference flow cell was

404

treated with buffer. Binding analysis of captured murine IgG antibodies to S1-His or RBD-His

405

(Sino Biological) was performed using a multi-cycle kinetic method with concentrations

406

ranging from 25 to 400 nM or 1.5625 to 50 nM, respectively. An association period of 180

407

seconds was followed by a dissociation period of 600 seconds with a constant flow rate of 40

408

μL/min and a final regeneration step. Binding kinetics were calculated using a global kinetic fit

409

model (1:1 Langmuir, Biacore T200 Evaluation Software Version 3.1, Cytiva).

416

inoculum was removed and cells were washed with PBS before medium supplemented with

417

anti-VSV-G antibody (clone 8G5F11, Kerafast Inc.) was added to neutralise residual input

418

virus. VSV/SARS-CoV-2 pseudovirus-containing medium was harvested 20 hours after

419

inoculation, 0.2 µm filtered and stored at -80 °C.

420

Serial dilutions of mouse serum samples were prepared and pre-incubated for 10 minutes at

421

room temperature with VSV/SARS-CoV-2 pseudovirus suspension (4.8 × 103 infectious units

422

[IU]/mL) before transferring the mix to Vero 76 cells. Inoculated Vero-76 cells were incubated

423

for 20 hours at 37 °C. Plates were placed in an IncuCyte Live Cell Analysis system (Sartorius)

424

and incubated for 30 minutes prior to the analysis (IncuCyte 2019B Rev2 software). Whole

425

well scanning for brightfield and GFP fluorescence was performed using a 4× objective. The

426

50% pseudovirus neutralisation titre (pVNT50) was reported as the reciprocal of the first serum

427

dilution yielding a 50% reduction in GFP-positive infected cell number per well compared to

428

the mean of the no serum pseudovirus positive control. Each serum sample dilution was tested

433

with the full-length S peptide mix (0.1 µg/mL final concentration per peptide) or controls

434

(gp70-AH1 [SPSYVYHQF]33, 4 µg/mL; Concanavalin A [ConA], 2 µg/mL [Sigma]).

435

Streptavidin-alkaline phosphatase (ALP) and BCIP/NBT-plus substrate were added, and spots

436

counted using an ELISpot plate reader (ImmunoSpot® S6 Core Analyzer [CTL]). Spot numbers

437

were evaluated using ImmunoCapture Image Aquision Software V7.0 and ImmunoSpot

438

7.0.17.0 Professional. Spot counts denoted too numerous to count by the software were set to

439

1,500. For T-cell subtyping, CD8+ T cells and CD4+ T cells were isolated from splenocyte

440

suspensions using MACS MicroBeads (CD8a [Ly-2] and CD4 [L3T4] [Miltenyi Biotec])

441

according to the manufacturer’s instructions. 1 × 105 CD8+ or CD4+ T cells were subsequently

Mouse cells were acquired on a BD Symphony A3 or BD Celesta (B-cell subtyping) flow

480

cytometer (BD Bioscience) using BD FACSDiva software version 9.1 or 8.0.1.1, respectively,

481

and analysed with FlowJo 10.6 (FlowJo LLC, BD Biosciences).

482

For rhesus macaques intracellular cytokine staining in T cells, 1.5 x 106 PBMCs were stimulated

483

with the full-length S peptide mix at 1 μg/mL, Staphyloccocus enterotoxin B (SEB; 2 μg/mL)

484

as positive control, or 0.2% DMSO as negative control. GolgiStop and GolgiPlug (both BD

485

Bioscience) were added. Following 37 °C incubation for 12 to 16 h, cells were stained for

486

viability and extracellular antigens after blocking Fc binding sites with directly labelled

487

antibodies. Cells were then fixed and permeabilized with BDCytoFix/CytoPerm solution (BD

The SARS-CoV-2 neutralisation assay used a previously described strain of SARS-CoV-2

501

(USA_WA1/2020) that had been rescued by reverse genetics and engineered by the insertion

502

of an mNeonGreen (mNG) gene into open reading frame 7 of the viral genome25. This reporter

503

virus generates similar plaque morphologies and indistinguishable growth curves from wild-

504

type virus. Viral master stocks were grown in Vero 76 cells as previously described44. When

505

testing human convalescent serum specimens, the fluorescent neutralisation assay produced

506

comparable results as the conventional plaque reduction neutralisation assay. Serial dilutions

approximately a 10-30% infection rate of the Vero CCL81 monolayer for 1 hour at 37 °C before

509

inoculating Vero CCL81 cell monolayers (targeted to have 8,000 to 15,000 cells in the central

510

field of each well at the time of seeding, one day before infection) in 96-well plates to allow

511

accurate quantification of infected cells. Cell counts were enumerated by nuclear stain (Hoechst

512

33342) and fluorescent virally infected foci were detected 16-24 hours after inoculation with a

513

Cytation 7 Cell Imaging Multi-Mode Reader (Biotek) with Gen5 Image Prime version 3.09.

514

Titers were calculated in GraphPad Prism version 8.4.2 by generating a 4- parameter (4PL)

515

logistical fit of the percent neutralisation at each serial serum dilution. The 50% neutralisation

516

titre (VNT50) was reported as the interpolated reciprocal of the dilution yielding a 50%

517

reduction in fluorescent viral foci.

518

SARS-CoV-2 challenge of rhesus macaques (Macaca mulatta).

519

The SARS-CoV-2 inoculum was obtained from a stock of 2.1 × 106 PFU/mL previously

520

prepared at Texas Biomedical Research Institute (San Antonio, TX), aliquoted into single use

521

vials, and stored at -70 °C. The working virus stock was generated from two passages of the

522

SARS-CoV-2 USA-WA1/2020 isolate (a 4th passage seed stock purchased from BEI Resources;

523

NR-52281) in Vero 76 cells. The virus was confirmed to be SARS-CoV-2 by deep sequencing

524

and identical to the published sequence (GenBank accession number MN985325.1).

525

BNT162b2-immunised (n=6) and age-matched saline control-immunised (n=3) male rhesus

526

macaques (control) were challenged with 1.05 × 106 plaque forming units of SARS-CoV-2

527

USA-WA1/2020 isolate, split equally between the intranasal (IN; 0.25 mL) and intratracheal

528

(IT; 0.25 mL) routes as previously described26. The challenge was performed 55 days after the

529

second immunisation. A separate sentinel group of non-immunised age- and sex-matched

530

animals (n=3) was mock challenged with DMEM supplemented with 10% FCS IN (0.25 mL)

531

and IT (0.25 mL). Approximately two weeks prior to challenge, animals were moved to the

532

ABSL-3 facility at Southwest National Primate Research Center (SNPRC; San Antonio, TX).

533

Animals were monitored regularly by a board-certified veterinary clinician for rectal body

534

temperature, weight and physical examination. Specimen collection was performed under

535

tiletamine zolazepam (Telazol) anaesthesia as described26. Nasal and oropharyngeal swabs

536

were collected from all macaques at Day 0, 1, 3, and 6 (relative to the day of challenge), from

537

BNT162b2-immunised macaques on Day 7 or 8, and from control and sentinel macaques on

538

Day 10. Bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) was performed on all macaques the week before

539

challenge and on Days 3 and 6 post-challenge and on BNT162b2-immunised macaques on Day

540

7 or 8. BAL was performed by instilling four times 20 mL of saline. These washings were

541

pooled, aliquoted and stored frozen at -70 °C. Necropsy was performed on BNT162b2-

542

immunised animals on Day 7 or 8. Control and sentinel animals were not necropsied to allow

543

re-challenge (control) or challenge (sentinel) on a subsequent day.

544

Reverse-transcription quantitative polymerase chain reaction.

545

To detect and quantify SARS-CoV-2 in NHP, viral RNA was extracted from nasal swabs, OP

546

swabs, and BAL specimens as previously described45–47 and tested by RT-qPCR as previously

547

described26. Briefly, 10 µg yeast tRNA and 1 × 103 PFU of MS2 phage (Escherichia coli

548

bacteriophage MS2, ATCC) were added to each thawed sample, and RNA extraction performed

549

using the NucleoMag Pathogen kit (Macherey-Nagel). The SARS-CoV-2 RT-qPCR was

550

performed on extracted RNA using a CDC-developed 2019-nCoV_N1 assay on a QuantStudio

551

3 instrument (Applied Biosystems). The cut-off for positivity (limit of detection, LOD) was

552

established at 10 gene equivalents (GE) per reaction (800 GE/mL). Samples were tested in

553

duplicate. On day 6, one BAL specimen from the control group and one day 1 nasal swab from

554

the BNT162b1-immunised group had, on repeated measurements, viral RNA levels on either

555

side of the LLOD. These specimens were categorised as indeterminate and excluded from the

556

graphs and the analysis.

557

Statistics and reproducibility.

558

No statistical methods were used to predetermine group and samples sizes (n). All experiments

559

were performed once. P-values reported for RT-qPCR analysis were determined by

560

nonparametric analysis (Friedman’s test) based on the ranking of viral RNA shedding data

561

within each day. PROC RANK and PROC GLM from SAS® 9.4 were used to calculate the p-

562

values. Samples from post challenge days (Days 3, 6 and end of protocol [EOP] for BAL; Days

563

1, 3, 6 and 10 [control and sentinel] or EOP [BNT162b2-immunised] for nasal and

564

oropharyngeal swabs) were included in the analysis. Indeterminate results were excluded from

565

this analysis. All remaining analyses were carried out using GraphPad Prism 8.4.

Figure 4. Protection of rhesus macaques from challenge with infectious SARS-CoV-2.
Fifty-five days after the Dose 2 of 100 µg BNT162b2 (n=6) or saline control (n=3), rhesus macaques were
challenged with 1.05 × 106 total pfu of SARS-CoV-2 split equally between the IN and IT routes. Nonimmunised rhesus macaques (n=3) were mock-challenged with cell culture medium (sentinel). Viral RNA
levels were detected by RT-qPCR. BAL was performed and nasal and oropharyngeal (OP) swabs obtained
at the indicated time points. Final collection of samples was on Day 10 relative to challenge for the sentinel
and control groups and at the end of protocol (EOP) on Day 7 or 8 for the BNT162b2-immunised group.
Ratios above data points indicate the number of viral RNA positive animals among all animals per group.
Heights of bars indicate geometric means. Whiskers indicate geometric standard deviations. Every symbol
represents one animal. Dotted lines indicate the lower limits of detection (LLOD). Values below the LLOD
were set to ½ the LLOD. a, Viral RNA in bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) fluid. b, Viral RNA in nasal

Extended Data Figure 4. B-cell and T-cell phenotyping in lymph nodes, spleen and blood of
BNT162b2 immunised mice.
Mice (n=8 per group) were immunised with 5 µg BNT162b2 or buffer (Control). P-values were determined
by an unpaired two-tailed t-test. a+b, B-cell and T-cell numbers 12 days after immunisation in (a) draining
lymph nodes (dLN; for B-cell subtyping only: n=4 for control, n=7 for BNT162b2 immunised group) or
(b) the spleen, determined by flow cytometry. The percentage of ICOS+ cells among T follicular helper
cells (TFH) in dLNs is depicted on the lower right in (a). c, B- and T-cell fractions in the blood seven days
after immunisation.
