Abstract

2

Human severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is most closely

3

related, by average genetic distance, to two coronaviruses isolated from bats, RaTG13 and

4

RmYN02. However, there is a segment of high amino acid similarity between human SARS-

5

CoV-2 and a pangolin isolated strain, GD410721, in the receptor binding domain (RBD) of

6

the spike protein, a pattern that can be caused by either recombination or by convergent

7

amino acid evolution driven by natural selection. We perform a detailed analysis of the

8

synonymous divergence, which is less likely to be affected by selection than amino acid

9

divergence, between human SARS-CoV-2 and related strains. We show that the

10

synonymous divergence between the bat derived viruses and SARS-CoV-2 is larger than

11

between GD410721 and SARS-CoV-2 in the RBD, providing strong additional support for

12

the recombination hypothesis. However, the synonymous divergence between pangolin

13

strain and SARS-CoV-2 is also relatively high, which is not consistent with a recent

14

recombination between them, instead it suggests a recombination into RaTG13. We also

15

find a 14-fold increase in the dN/dS ratio from the lineage leading to SARS-CoV-2 to the

16

strains of the current pandemic, suggesting that the vast majority of non-synonymous

17

mutations currently segregating within the human strains have a negative impact on viral

18

fitness. Finally, we estimate that the time to the most recent common ancestor of SARS-

19

CoV-2 and RaTG13 or RmYN02 based on synonymous divergence, is 51.71 years (95%

20

C.I., 28.11-75.31) and 37.02 years (95% C.I., 18.19-55.85), respectively.

Introduction

23

The Covid19 pandemic is perhaps the biggest public health and economic threat that the world

24

has faced for decades (Li, Guan, et al. 2020; Wu, et al. 2020; Zhou, Yang, et al. 2020). It is

25

caused by a coronavirus (Lu, et al. 2020; Zhang and Holmes 2020), Severe acute respiratory

syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), an RNA virus with a 29,903 bp genome consisting of

2

four major structural genes (Wu, et al. 2020; Zhou, Yang, et al. 2020). Of particular relevance to

3

this study is the spike protein which is responsible for binding to the primary receptor for the

4

virus, angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) (Wan, et al. 2020; Wu, et al. 2020; Zhou, Yang,

5

et al. 2020).

6

Human SARS-CoV-2 is related to a coronavirus (RaTG13) isolated from the bat

7

Rhinolophus affinis from Yunnan province of China (Zhou, Yang, et al. 2020). RaTG13 and the

8

human strain reference sequence (Genbank accession number MN996532) are 96.2% identical

9

and it was first argued that, throughout the genome, RaTG13 is the closest relative to human

10

SARS-CoV-2 (Zhou, Yang, et al. 2020). And RaTG13 and SARS-CoV-2 were 91.02% and

11

90.55% identical, respectively, to coronaviruses isolated from Malayan pangolins (Pangolin-CoV)

12

seized at the Guangdong customs of China, which therefore form a close outgroup to the

13

SARS-CoV-2+RaTG13 clade (Zhang, et al. 2020). Furthermore, five key amino acids in the

14

receptor-binding domain (RBD) of spike were identical between SARS-CoV-2 and Pangolin-

15

CoV, but differed between those two strains and RaTG13 (Zhang, et al. 2020). Xiao et al

16

assembled and analysed a full-length Pangolin-CoV genome sequence, showing that the

17

receptor-binding domain of its S protein differs from the SARS-CoV-2 by only one noncritical

18

amino acid (Xiao, et al. 2020). Similar observations were made using Pangolin-CoV strains

19

found in Malayan pangolin samples seized by the Guangxi customs of China (Lam, et al. 2020).

20

Additionally, it is shown that when analyzing a window of length 582bp in the RBD,

21

nonsynonymous mutations support a phylogenetic tree with SARS-CoV-2 and Pangolin-CoV as

22

sister-groups, while synonymous mutations do not (Lam, et al. 2020). They discuss two possible

23

explanations for their results, one which includes recombination and another which includes

24

selection-driven convergent evolution. Independent analysis also support SARS-CoV-2 obtains

25

the receptor binding motif through recombination from a donor related to this Pangolin-CoV

26

strain (Li, Giorgi, et al. 2020). Detailed phylogenetic analysis on sub-regions across the S

protein showed that it is the RaTG13 sequence that show exceptionally divergent pattern in the

2

RBD region, they instead argued a recombination occurred into RaTG13 from an unknown

3

divergent source (Boni, et al. 2020). This would explain the amino acid similarity between

4

SARS-CoV-2 and Pangolin-CoV in the RBD as an ancestral trait that has been lost (by

5

recombination) in RaTG13. Using a phylogenetic analysis they also dated the RaTG13 and

6

SARS-CoV-2 divergence to be between 40 to 70 years. Recently, Zhou et al. discovered a viral

7

strain, RmYN02 from the bat Rhinolophus malayanus, with a reported 97.2% identity in the

8

ORF1ab gene but with only 61.3% sequence similarity to SARS-CoV-2 in the RBD (Zhou, Chen,

9

et al. 2020). Moreover, the RmYN02 strain also harbors multiple amino acid insertions at the

10

S1/S2 cleavage site in the spike protein (Zhou, Chen, et al. 2020).

11

To analyze the history of these sequences further, we here focus on patterns of

12

synonymous divergence, which has received less focus, but also is less likely to be affected by

13

selection than amino acid divergence. We develop a bias corrected estimator of synonymous

14

divergence specific for SARS-CoV-2 and related strains, and analyze divergence using both

15

sliding windows and a whole-genome approach between SARS-CoV-2 and related viral strains.

using the default parameters for makeblastdb. Blast searches were performed using blastn

2

(Altschul, et al. 1990) with parameters “-word_size 7 -reward 1 -penalty -3” and all other

3

parameters as the default settings. All the blast hits to different Guangdong pangolin viral strain

4

sequences were merged as one hit, and the blast hits to different Guangxi pangolin viral strain

5

sequences were also merged.

7

Alignment: To obtain an in-frame alignment of the genomes, we first identified the coding

8

sequences of each viral strain using independent pairwise alignments with the coding

9

sequences of the SARS-CoV-2 (Wuhan-Hu-1) genome. The genome alignments were

10

performed using MAFFT (v7.450) (Katoh and Standley 2013) with parameters “--maxiterate

11

1000 --localpair”. The coding sequences of each gene were aligned using PRANK (Loytynoja

12

2014) (v.170427) with parameters “-codon -F”. Finally, the alignments for all genes were

13

concatenated following their genomic order. ORF1a was excluded since its sequence is a

14

subset of ORF1ab.

15
16

Recombination detection: We detected possible recombination events across the genome using

17

a combination of 7 alogorithms, RDP (Martin and Rybicki 2000), GENECONV (Padidam, et al.

18

1999), Bootscan (Salminen, et al. 1995), Maxchi (Smith 1992), Chimaera (Posada and Crandall

19

2001), SiSscan (Gibbs, et al. 2000), and 3Seq (Boni, et al. 2007) implemented in RDP5

20

program (Martin, et al. 2015) (version Beta 5.5) and then considered the recombination signals

21

that were supported by at least two methods. We note that these 7 methods are all based on

22

inferring recombination using the same type of evidence, and concordance between the

23

methods cannot be interpreted as validation of the recombination signal. However, we will also

24

use phylogenetic methods and methods based on relative sequence divergence to further

25

investigate the putative recombination signals. The analysis was performed on the multiple

26

sequence alignment consisting of the five viral strains. All regions showing recombination

2

stating that recombination regions were removed.

Tree estimation: We estimated phylogenetic trees using two methods: Neighbor Joining (NJ)

5

and Maximum Likelihood (ML). The NJ trees were estimated using dN or dS distance matrices

6

which estimated using codeml (Yang 2007) with parameters " runmode= -2, CodonFreq = 2,

7

cleandata = 1". To obtain bootstrap values, we bootstrapped the multiple sequence alignments

8

1,000 times, repeating the inference procedure for each bootstrap sample. The NJ tree was

9

estimated using the 'neighbor' software from the PHYLIP package (Felsenstein 2009). For ML

10

trees, we used IQ-TREE (Nguyen, et al. 2015) (v1.5.2) with parameter “-TEST -alrt 1000” which

11

did substitution model selection for the alignments and performed maximum-likelihood tree

12

estimation with the selected substitution model for 1,000 bootstrap replicates. For this analysis,

13

we masked all regions (Supplementary Table 5) that show recombination signals in any of the

14

five studied viral genome. We masked regions from all sequences when at least one sequence

15

showed evidence for recombination in that region. All masked regions are listed in

16

Supplementary Table 5. The coordinates (based on the Wuhan-Hu-1 genome) of the three

17

recombination regions (merged set of all the regions in Supplementary Table 5) were: 14611-

18

15225, 21225-24252 and 25965-28297. We also estimate genome-wide divergence between

19

RaTG13 and Wuhan-Hu-1 only excluding the region (position 22853-23092) where potential

20

recombination was detected for the Wuhan-Hu-1 strain (Supplementary Table 5).

Simulations: We simulated divergence with realistic parameters for SARS-CoV-2 using a

23

continuous time Markov chain under the F3x4 codon-based model (Goldman and Yang 1994;

24

Muse and Gaut 1994) (Yang, et al. 2000), which predicts codon frequencies from the empirical

1

The genome of human coronavirus can effectively recombine with other viruses to form a

2

chimeric new strain when they co-infect the same host (Forni, et al. 2017; Boni, et al. 2020).

3

Complicated recombination histories have been observed in the receptor binding motif region of

4

the spike protein (Lam, et al. 2020; Xiao, et al. 2020; Zhang, et al. 2020) and several other

5

regions (Boni, et al. 2020) of the SARS-CoV-2, it is thus important to exhaustively search along

6

the viral genome for other regions potentially of recombination origin and identify possible

7

donors associated with them. To identify possible viral strains that may have contributed, by

8

recombination, to the formation of human SARS-CoV-2, we searched NCBI and EMBL virus

9

entries along with GISAID Epiflu and EpiCov databases for similar sequences using BLAST in

10

100bp windows stepping every 10bp (Fig. 1b). The majority of the genome (78.1%, 2330/2982

11

of the windows) has one unique best hit, likely reflecting the high genetic diversity of the

12

coronavirus. 21.9% of the genomic regions has multiple best hits, which suggests that these

13

regions might be more conserved. Among the windows with unique best hits, 97.0% (2260/2330)

14

of them were the RaTG13 or RmYN02 bat strains and 1.9% of them, including the ACE2

15

contact residues region of the S protein, were the pangolin SARS-CoV-2 virus. These

16

observations are consistent with previous results that RaTG13 and RmYN02 are the most

17

closely related viral strains, while the region containing the ACE2 contact residues is more

18

closely related to the pangolin virus strain (Lam, et al. 2020; Li, Giorgi, et al. 2020; Xiao, et al.

19

2020; Zhang, et al. 2020). A considerable amount of genomic regions (20 windows with unique

20

hits) show highest sequence identity with other coronaviruses of the SARS-CoV-2 related

21

lineage (Lam, et al. 2020) (bat-SL-CoVZC45 and bat-SL-CoVZXC21 (Hu, et al. 2018)). In

22

addition, there were 6 windows whose unique top hits are coronavirus of a SARS-CoV related

23

lineage (Lam, et al. 2020) (Supplementary Table 4). The mosaic pattern that different regions of

24

the genome show highest identity to different virus strains is likely to have been caused by the

25

rich recombination history of the SARS-CoV-2 lineage (Boni, et al. 2020; Li, Giorgi, et al. 2020;

26

Patiño-Galindo, et al. 2020). Moreover, its unique connection with SARS-CoV related lineages

in some genomic regions may suggest recombination between the ancestral lineage of SARS-

2

CoV-2 and distantly related virus lineages, although more formal analyses are needed to

3

determine the recombination history (see also Boni, et al. 2020 for further discussion).

4

Searching databases with BLAST using the most closely related viral strains, RaTG13 and

5

RmYN02, we observe a very similar pattern, as that observed for SARS-CoV-2, in terms of top

6

hits across the genome (Fig. 1b), suggesting that these possible recombination events with

7

distantly related lineages are not unique to the SARS-CoV-2 lineage, but happened on the

8

ancestral lineage of SARS-CoV-2, RaTG13, and RmYN02. A notable exception is a large region

9

around the S gene, where RmYN02 show little similarity to both SARS-CoV-2 and RaTG13.

10
11

Sequence similarity and recombination

12

We focus further on studying the synonymous evolution of SARS-CoV-2, and analyzing Wuhan-

13

Hu-1 as the human nCoV19 reference strain (Wu, et al. 2020) along with the four viral strains

14

with highest overall identity: the bat strains RmYN02 and RaTG13 (Zhou, Chen, et al. 2020;

15

Zhou, Yang, et al. 2020), and the Malayan pangolin strains, GD410721 and GX_P1E, which

16

were isolated from Malayan pangolin samples seized by Guangdong and Guangxi Customs of

17

China, respectively. These four strains have previously been identified as the strains most

18

closely related to SARS-CoV-2 (Lam, et al. 2020; Xiao, et al. 2020). Other available

19

phylogenetically related, but less similar viral strains, such as bat-SL-CoVZXC21 and bat-SL-

20

CoVZC45 (Hu, et al. 2018), are not included due to nearly saturated synonymous mutations

21

when compared with SARS-CoV-2 (maximum likelihood estimates of dS = 3.2067 and 2.8445,

22

respectively).

23

We performed recombination analyses across the five viral genomes based on the

24

concensus of the seven recombination-detection methods implemented in RDP5 (see Methods).

25

We identified nine recombination regions affecting at least one of the sequences

26

(Supplementary Table 5). Phylogenetic analyses of these regions confirm phylogenetic

incongruence when compared with genome-wide trees (Fig. 2 and Supplementary Figure 1-3).

2

Particularly, a recombination signal is found in a region encompassing the RBD of the S protein,

3

suggesting that the human SARS-CoV-2 (Wuhan-Hu-1) sequence is a recombinant with the

4

Pangolin-CoV (GD410721) as the donor (Supplementary Table 5). Phylogenetic analyses also

5

support that Wuhan-Hu-1 and GD410721 form a clade relative to RaTG13 (Supplementary

6

Figure 1c, 1d). Phylogenetic analyses (Fig. 2) in genomic regions with all recombination tracts

7

(Supplementary Table 5) masked using Maximum-likelihood (Fig. 2a) and Neighbor-joining

8

based on synonymous (Fig. 2b) or non-synoymous (Fig. 2c) mutation distance metrics,

9

consistently support RmYN02 as the nearest outgroup to human SARS-CoV-2, in contrast to

10

previous analyses before the discovery of RmYN02, which instead found RaTG13 to be the

11

nearest outgroup (Lam, et al. 2020; Wu, et al. 2020). This observation is also consistent with the

12

genome-wide phylogeny constructed in previous study (Zhou, Chen, et al. 2020).

13

We plot the overall sequence similarity (% nucleotides identical) between SARS-CoV-2

14

and the four other strains analyzed in windows of 300 bp (Fig. 1). Notice that the divergences

15

between human SARS-CoV-2 and the bat viral sequences, RaTG13 and RmYN02, in most

16

regions of the genome, are quite low compared to the other comparisons. A notable exception is

17

the suspected recombination region in RmYN02 that has an unusual high level of divergence

18

with all other viruses (Fig. 1e). However, there is also another exception: a narrow window in the

19

RBD of the S gene where the divergence between SARS-CoV-2 and GD410721 is moderate

20

and the divergences between GD410721 and both SARS-CoV-2 and RaTG13 are quite high

21

and show very similar pattern. This, as also found in the recombination analyses based on

22

methdos implemented in RDP5, would suggest a recombination event from a strain related to

23

GD410721 into an ancestor of the human strain (Lam, et al. 2020; Xiao, et al. 2020; Zhang, et al.

24

2020), or alternatively, from some other species into RaTG13, as previously hypothesized (Boni,

25

et al. 2020). We note that RmYN02 is not informative about the nature of this event as it harbors

26

a long and divergent haplotype in this region, possibly associated with another independent

recombination event with more distantly related viral strains (Fig. 1e). The other four sequences

2

are all highly, and approximately equally, divergent from RmYN02 in this large region (Fig. 1e),

3

suggesting that the RmYN02 strain obtained a divergent haplotype from the recombination

4

event. When BLAST searching using 100-bp windows along the RmYN02 genome, we find no

5

single viral genome as the top hit, instead the top hits are found sporadically in different viral

strains of the SARS-CoV lineage (Fig. 1f), suggesting that the sequence of the most proximal

donor is not represented in the database.

based on synonymous substitutions supported RaTG13 as the sister taxon to the human SARS-

13

CoV-2 also in this region. That would suggest the similarity between GD410721 and human

14

SARS-CoV-2 might be a consequence of convergent evolution, possibly because both strains

15

adapted to the use of the same receptor. An objective of the current study is to examine if there

16

are more narrow regions of the spike protein that might show evidence of recombination. We

17

investigate this issue using estimates of synonymous divergence per synonymous site (dS) in

18

sliding windows of 300 bp. However, estimation of dS is complicated by the high levels of

19

divergence and extremely skewed nucleotide content in the 3rd position of the sequences

20

(Table 1) which will cause a high degree of homoplasy. We, therefore, entertain methods for

21

estimation that explicitly account for unequal nucleotide content and multiple hits in the same

22

site such as maximum likelihood methods and the YN00 method (Yang and Nielsen 2000). It is

23

shown that for short sequences, some counting methods, such as the YN00 method, can

24

perform better in terms of Mean Squared Error (MSE) for estimating dN and dS(Yang and

25

Nielsen 2000). However, it is unclear in the current case how best to estimate dS. For this

26

reason, we performed a small simulations study (see Methods) for evaluating the performance

of the maximum likelihood (ML) estimator of dN and dS (as implemented in codeml (Yang 2007))

under the F3x4 model and the YN00 method implemented in PAML. In general, we find that

3

estimates under the YN00 are more biased with slightly higher MSE than the ML estimate for

4

values in the most relevant regime of dS < 1.5 (Fig. 3). However, we also notice that both

5

estimators are biased under these conditions. For this reason, we perform a bias correction

calibrated using simulations specific to the nucleotide frequencies and dN/dS ratio observed for

9

that there is a trade-off between mean and variance (Fig. 3) so that the MSE becomes very

10

large, particularly for the for yn00 method, after bias correction. For dS >2 the estimates are

11

generally not reliable, however, we note that for dS <1.5 the bias-corrected ML estimator tends

12

overall to have slightly lower MSE, and we, therefore, use this estimator for analyses of 300 bp

13

regions.

Synonymous divergence

16

We estimate dN and dS under the F3x4 model in codeml (Goldman and Yang 1994; Muse and

17

Gaut 1994) and find genome-wide estimates of dS = 0.1604, dN = 0.0065 (dN/ dS = 0.0405)

18

between SARS-CoV-2 and RaTG13 and dS = 0.2043, dN = 0.0220 (dN/ dS = 0.1077) between

19

SARS-CoV-2 and RmYN02. However, a substantial amount of this divergence might be caused

20

by recombination with more divergent strains. We, therefore, also estimate dN and dS for the

21

regions with inferred recombination tracts (Supplementary Table 5) removed from all

22

sequences (Table 3). We then find values of dS = 0.1462 (95% C.I., 0.1340-0.1584) and dS =

23

0.1117 (95% C.I., 0.1019-0.1215) between SARS-CoV-2 and RaTG13 and RmYN02,

24

respectively. This confirms that RmYN02 is the virus most closely related to SARS-CoV-2. The

25

relative high synonymous divergence also shows that the apparent high nucleotide similarity

1

between SARS-CoV-2 and the bat strains (96.2% (Zhou, Yang, et al. 2020) and 97.2%(Zhou,

2

Chen, et al. 2020)) is caused by conservation at the amino acid level (dN/ dS = 0.0410 and

3

0.0555) exacerbated by a high degree of synonymous homoplasy facilitated by a highly skewed

4

nucleotide composition at the third position of codons (with an AT content >72%, Table 1).

5

The synonymous divergence to the pangolin sequences GD410721 and GX_P1E in

6

genomic regions with inferred recombination tracts removed is 0.5095 (95% C.I., 0.4794-0.5396)

7

and 1.0304 (95% C.I., 0.9669-1.0939), respectively. Values for other comparisons are shown in

8

Tables 2 and 3. In comparisons between SARS-CoV-2 and more distantly related strains, dS will

9

be larger than 1, and with this level of saturation, estimation of divergence is associated with

10

high variance and may be highly dependent on the accuracy of the model assumptions. This

11

makes phylogenetic analyses based on synonymous mutations unreliable when applied to

12

these more divergent sequences. Nonetheless, the synonymous divergence levels seem

13

generally quite compatible with a molecular clock with a dS of 0.9974 (95% C.I., 0.9381-1.0567,

14

GD410721), 1.0366 (95% C.I., 0.9737-1.0995, RaTG13), 1.0333 (95% C.I., 0.9699-1.0967,

15

RmYN02) and 1.0304 (95% C.I., 0.9669-1.0939, Wuhan-Hu-1) between the outgroup, GX_P1E ,

16

and the three ingroup strains. The largest value is observed for RaTG13 (dS = 1.0366), despite

17

this sequence being the most early sampled sequence, perhaps caused by additional

18

undetected recombination into RaTG13.

19
20

Sliding windows of synonymous divergence

21

To address the issue of possible recombination we plot dS between SARS-CoV-2, GD410721,

22

and RaTG13 and the ratio of dS(SARS-CoV-2, GD410721) to dS(SARS-CoV-2, RaTG13) in 300

23

bp sliding windows along the genome. Notice that we truncate the estimate of dS at 3.0.

24

Differences between estimates larger than 2.0 should not be interpreted strongly, as these

25

estimates have high variance and likely will be quite sensitive to the specifics of the model

26

assumptions.

1

We find that dS(SARS-CoV-2, GD410721) approximately equals dS(GD410721, RaTG13)

2

and is larger than dS(SARS-CoV-2, RaTG13) in almost the entire genome showing than in these

3

parts of the genome GD410721 is a proper outgroup to (SARS-CoV-2, RaTG13) assuming a

4

constant molecular clock. One noticeable exception from this is the RBD region of the S gene.

5

In this region the divergence between SARS-CoV-2 and GD410721 is substantially lower than

6

between GD410721 and RaTG13 (Fig. 4a,4c). The same region also has much smaller

7

divergence between SARS-CoV-2 and GD410721 than between SARS-CoV-2 and RaTG13

8

(Fig. 4a,4c). The pattern is quite different than that observed in the rest of the genome, most

9

easily seen by considering the ratio of dS(SARS-CoV-2, GD410721) to dS(SARS-CoV-2,

10

RaTG13) (Fig. 2b, 2d). In fact, the estimates of dS(SARS-CoV-2, RaTG13) are saturated in this

11

region, even though they are substantially lower than 1 in the rest of the genome. This strongly

12

suggests a recombination event in the region and provides independent evidence of that

13

previously reported based on amino acid divergence (e.g.,(Zhang, et al. 2020)).

14

The combined evidences from synonymous divergence and the topological

15

recombination inference, provide strong support for the recombination hypothesis. However,

16

these analyses alone do not distinguish between recombination into RaTG13 from an unknown

17

source as previously hypothesized (Boni, et al. 2020) and recombination between SARS-CoV-2

18

and GD410721 as proposed as one possible explanation by Lam et al. (Lam, et al. 2020). To

19

distinguish between these hypotheses we searched for sequences that might be more closely

20

related, in the RBD region, to RaTG13 than SARS-CoV-2 and we plotted sliding window

21

similarities across the genome for RaTG13 (Fig. 1c). We observe relatively low sequence

22

identity between RaTG13 and all three other strains in the ACE2 contact residue region of the

23

spike protein, which is more consistent with the hypothesis of recombination into RaTG13, as

24

proposed in (Boni, et al. 2020). Moreover, our BLAST search analyses of RaTG13 in this region

25

show highest local sequence similarity with GX pangolin virus strains which is the genome-wide

26

outgroup for the three other sequences (Lam, et al. 2020). This observation is more compatible

with the hypothesis of recombination from a virus related to GX pangolin strains, than with

2

recombination between SARS-CoV-2 and GD410721.

3

Unfortunately, because of the high level of synonymous divergence to the nearest

4

outgroup, tree estimation in small windows is extremely labile in this region. In fact, synonymous

5

divergence appears fully saturated in the comparison with GX_P1E, eliminating the possibility to

6

infer meaningful trees based on synonymous divergence. However, we can use the overall

7

maximum likelihood tree using both synonymous and nonsynonymous mutations (Fig. 2d). The

8

ML tree using sequence from the ACE2 contact residue region supports the clustering of SARS-

9

CoV-2 and GD410721, but with unusual long external branches for all strains except SARS-

10

CoV-2, possibly reflecting smaller recombination regions within the ACE2 contact residue region.

11
12

Weakly deleterious mutations and clock calibrations

13

The use of synonymous mutations provides an opportunity to calibrate the molecular clock

14

without relying on amino acid changing mutations that are more likely to be affected by selection.

15

The rate of substitution of weakly and slightly deleterious mutations is highly dependent on

16

ecological factors and the effective population size. Weakly deleterious mutations are more

17

likely to be observed over small time scales than over long time scales, as they are unlikely to

18

persist in the population for a long time and go to fixation. This will lead to a decreasing dN/dS

19

ratio for longer evolutionary lineages. Furthermore, changes in effective population size will

20

translate into changes in the rate of substitution of slightly deleterious mutations. Finally,

21

changes in ecology (such as host shifts, host immune changes, changes in cell surface receptor,

22

etc.) can lead to changes in the rate of amino acid substitution. For all of these reasons, the use

23

of synonymous mutations, which are less likely to be the subject of selection than

24

nonsynonymous mutations, are preferred in molecular clock calculations. For many viruses, the

25

use of synonymous mutations to calibrate divergence times is not possible, as synonymous

26

sites are fully saturated even at short divergence times. However, for the comparisons between

1

SARS-CoV-2 and RaTG13, and SARS-CoV-2 and RmYN02, synonymous sites are not

2

saturated and can be used for calibration. We find an estimate of ω = 0.0391 between SARS-

3

CoV-2 and RaTG13, excluding just the small RDB region showing a recombination signal in

4

SARS-CoV-2 (Supplementary Table 5, coordinates: 22851-23094). Using 1000 parametric

5

simulations under the estimated values and the F3x4 codon model, we find that the estimate is

6

approximately unbiased (𝜔𝜔´ = 0.0398, S.E.M.= 0.0001) and with standard deviation 0.0033,

7

providing an approximate 95% confidence interval of (0.0332, 0.0464). Also, using 59 human

8

strains of SARS-CoV-2 from Genbank and National Microbiology Data Center (See Methods)

9

we obtain an estimate of ω = 0.5604 using the F3x4 model in codeml. Notice that there is a 14-

10

fold difference in dN/dS ratio between these estimates. Assuming very little of this difference is

11

caused by positive selection, this suggests that the vast majority of mutations currently

12

segregating in the SARS-CoV-2 are slightly or weakly deleterious for the virus.

13
14

Dating of divergence between Bat viruses and SARS-CoV-2

15

To calibrate the clock we use the estimate provided by (http://virological.org/t/phylodynamic-

16

analysis-of-sars-cov-2-update-2020-03-06/420) of 𝜇𝜇 =1.04×10-3 substitutions/site/year (95% CI:

17
18
19
20

0.71x10-3, 1.40x10-3). The synonymous specific mutation rate can be found from this as

dS/year = 𝜇𝜇S = 𝜇𝜇/(pS +ωpN), where ω is the dN/dS ratio, and pN and pS are the proportions of

nonsynonymous and synonymous sites, respectively. The estimate of the total divergence on
the two lineages is then ^
𝑡𝑡 = 𝑑𝑑𝑑𝑑 (𝑝𝑝𝑝𝑝 + 𝜔𝜔𝜔𝜔𝜔𝜔)⁄𝜇𝜇 . Inserting the numbers from Table 3 for the

21

divergence between SARS-CoV-2 and RaTG13 and RmYN02 ,respectively, we find a total

22

divergence of 96.92 years and 74.05 years respectively. Taking into account that RaTG13 was

23

isolated July 2013, we find an estimated tMRCA between that strain and SARS-CoV-2 of

24

^
𝑡𝑡 =(96.92 +6.5)/2 = 51.71 years. Similarly, we find an estimate of divergence between SARS-

2

different methods for dating (Boni, et al. 2020). The variance in the estimate in dS is small and

3

the uncertainty is mostly dominated by the uncertainty in the estimate of the mutation rate. We

4

estimate the S.D. in ^

parameters, for both RaTG13 vs. SARS-CoV-2 and for RmYN02 vs. SARS-CoV-2, and for each

simulated data also simulating values of 𝜇𝜇 and 𝜔𝜔 from normal distributions with mean 1.04×10-3

8

simulated data set to the same inference procedure as done on the real data. Our estimate of

9

the S.D. in the estimate is 11.8 for RaTG13 vs. SARS-CoV-2 and 9.41 for RmYN02 vs. SARS-

10

CoV-2, providing an approximate 95% confidence interval of (28.11, 75.31) and (18.19, 55.85),

11

respectively. For RaTG13, if including all sites, except the 244-bp in the RBD of the S gene

12

(Supplementary Table 5), the estimate is 55.02 years with an approx. 95% C.I. of (29.4, 80.7).

13

As more SARS-CoV-2 sequences are being obtained, providing more precise estimates of the

14

mutation rate, this confidence interval will become narrower. However, we warn that the

15

estimate is based on a molecular clock assumption and that violations of this assumption

16

eventually will become a more likely source of error than the statistical uncertainty quantified in

17

the calculation of the confidence intervals. We also note that, so far, we have assumed no

18

variation in the mutation rate among synonymous sites. However, just from the analysis of the

19

300 bp windows, it is clear that is not true. The variance in the estimate of dS among 300 bp

20

windows from the RaTG13-SARS-CoV-2 comparison is approximately 0.0113. In contrast, in

21

the simulated data assuming constant mutation rate, the variance is approximately 0.0034,

1

The highly skewed distribution of nucleotide frequencies in synonymous sites in SARS-CoV-2

2

(Kandeel, et al. 2020), along with high divergence, complicates the estimation of synonymous

3

divergence in SARS-CoV-2 and related viruses. In particular, in the third codon position the

4

nucleotide frequency of T is 43.5% while it is just 15.7% for C. This resulting codon usage is not

5

optimized for mammalian cells (e.g, (Chamary, et al. 2006)). A possible explanation is a strong

6

mutational bias caused by Apolipoprotein B mRNA-editing enzymes (APOBECs) which can

7

cause Cytosine-to-Uracil changes (Giorgio, et al. 2020).

8
9

A consequence of the skewed nucleotide frequencies is a high degree of homoplasy in
synonymous sites that challenges estimates of dS. We here evaluated estimators of dS in 300 bp

10

sliding windows and found that a bias-corrected version of the maximum likelihood estimator

11

tended to perform best for values of dS < 2. We used this estimator to investigate the

12

relationship between SARS-CoV-2 and related viruses in sliding windows. We show that

13

synonymous mutations show shorter divergence to pangolin viruses, than the otherwise most

14

closely related bat virus, RaTG13, in part of the receptor-binding domain of the spike protein.

15

This strongly suggests that the previously reported amino acid similarity between pangolin

16

viruses and SARS-CoV-2 is not due to convergent evolution, but more likely is due to

17

recombination. In the recombination analysis, we identified recombination from pangolin strains

18

into SARS-CoV-2, which provides further support for the recombination hypothesis. However,

19

we also find that the synonymous divergence between SARS-CoV-2 and pangolin viruses in this

20

region is relatively high, which is not consistent with a recent recombination between the two. It

21

instead suggests that the recombination was into RaTG13 from an unknown strain, rather than

22

between pangolin viruses and SARS-CoV-2, as proposed in (Boni, et al. 2020). The alternative

23

explanation of recombination into SARS-CoV-2 from the pangolin virus, would require the

24

additional assumption of a mutational hotspot to account for the high level of divergence in the

25

region between SARS-CoV-2 and the donor pangolin viral genome. To fully distinguish between

26

these hypotheses, additional strains would have to be discovered that either are candidates for

introgression into RaTG13 or can break up the lineage in the phylogenetic tree between

2

pangolin viruses and RaTG13.

3

The fact that synonymous divergence to the outgroups, RaTG13 and RmYN02, is not

4

fully saturated, provides an opportunity for a number of different analyses. First, we can date the

5

time of the divergence between the bat viruses and SARS-CoV-2 using synonymous mutations

6

alone. In doing so, we find estimates of 51.71 years (95% C.I., 28.11-75.31) and 37.02 years

7

(95% C.I., 18.19-55.85), respectively. Most of the uncertainty in these estimates comes from

8

uncertainty in the estimate of the mutation rate reported for SARS-CoV-2. As more data is being

9

produced for SARS-CoV-2, the estimate should become more precise and the confidence

10

interval significantly narrowed. We note that the mutation rate we use here are estimated based

11

on the entire genome, which may differ from that in non-recombination regions. To address this

12

problem, we downloaded all the SARS-CoV-2 sequences that are available until 2020-08-17

13

from GISAID, and obtained an estimate of 1:0.81 for the ratio of mutation rates in the

14

recombination and non-recombination regions, using the "GTRGAMMA" model implemented in

15

the RAxML (Stamatakis 2014). Given the length ratio between the two partitions is 1:4, the

16

difference between the partitions will cause a slight overestimate of the mutation rate by ~5%,

17

which is relatively small compared to the confidence intervals and the potential for other

18

unknown sources of uncertainty. However, we warn that a residual cause of unmodeled

19

statistical uncertainty is deviations from the molecular clock. Variation in the molecular clock

20

could be modeled statistically (see e.g., (Drummond, et al. 2006) and (Lartillot, et al. 2016)), but

21

the fact that synonymous mutations are mostly saturated for more divergent viruses that would

22

be needed to train such models, is a challenge to such efforts. On the positive side, we note that

23

the estimates of dS given in Table 3 in general are highly compatible with a constant molecular

24

clock. Boni et al. (Boni et al. 2020) obtained divergence time estimates similar to ours using a

25

very different approach based on including more divergent sequences and applying a relaxed

26

molecular clock. We see the two approaches as being complimentary. In the traditional relaxed

1

molecular clock approach more divergent sequences are needed that may introduce more

2

uncertainty due to various idiosyncrasies such as alignment errors. Furthermore, the relaxed

3

molecular clock uses both synonymous and non-synonymous mutations and is, therefore, more

4

susceptible to the effects of selection. Our approach allows us to focus on just the relevant in-

5

group species and to use only synonymous mutations. The disadvantage is that we cannot

6

accommodate a relaxed molecular clock. However, the fact that both approaches provide

7

similar estimates is reassuring and suggests that neither idiosyncrasies of divergent sequences,

8

natural selection, or deviations from a molecular clock has led to grossly misleading conclusions

9

Another advantage of estimation of synonymous and nonsynonymous rates in the

10

outgroup lineage, is that it can provide estimates of the mutational load of the current pandemic.

11

The dN/dS ratio is almost 14 times larger in the circulating SARS-CoV-2 strains than in the

12

outgroup lineage. While some of this difference could possibly be explained by positive

13

selection acting at a higher rate after zoonotic transfer, it is perhaps more likely that a

14

substantial proportion of segregating nonsynonymous mutations are deleterious, suggesting a

15

very high and increasing mutation load in circulating SARS-CoV-2 strains.
