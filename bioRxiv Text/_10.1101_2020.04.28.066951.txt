Abstract

22
23

Background: SARS-CoV-2, a positive-sense RNA virus in the family Coronaviridae,

24

has caused a worldwide pandemic of coronavirus disease 2019 or COVID-19

25

Coronaviruses generate a tiered series of subgenomic RNAs (sgRNAs) through a

26

process involving homology between transcriptional regulatory sequences (TRS)

27

located after the leader sequence in the 5’ UTR (the TRS-L) and TRS’ located near the

28

start of structural and accessory proteins (TRS-B) near the 3’ end of the genome. In

29

addition to the canonical sgRNAs generated by SARS-CoV-2, non-canonical sgRNAs

30

(nc-sgRNAs) have been reported. However, the consistency of these nc-sgRNAs

31

across viral isolates and infection conditions is unknown. The comprehensive definition

32

of SARS-CoV-2 RNA products is a key step in understanding SARS-CoV-2

33

pathogenesis.

34
35

Methods: Here, we report an integrative analysis of eight independent SARS-CoV-2

36

transcriptomes generated using three sequencing strategies, five host systems, and

37

seven viral isolates. Read-mapping to the SARS-CoV-2 genome was used to determine

38

the 5’ and 3’ coordinates of all identified junctions in viral RNAs identified in these

39

samples.

40
41

Results: Using junctional abundances, we show nc-sgRNAs make up as much as 33%

42

of total sgRNAs in vitro, are largely consistent in abundance across independent

43

transcriptomes, and increase in abundance over time during in vitro infection. By

44

assessing the homology between sequences flanking the 5’ and 3’ junction points, we

45

show that nc-sgRNAs are not associated with TRS-like homology. By incorporating read

46

coverage information, we find strong evidence for subgenomic RNAs that contain only

47

5’ regions of ORF1a. Finally, we show that non-canonical junctions change the

48

landscape of viral open reading frames.

49
50

Conclusions: We identify canonical and non-canonical junctions in SARS-CoV-2

51

sgRNAs and show that these RNA products are consistently generated across many

52

independent viral isolates and sequencing approaches. These analyses highlight the

53

diverse transcriptional activity of SARS-CoV-2 and offer important insights into SARS-

54

CoV-2 biology.

Background

60

Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) emerged from Wuhan,

61

China in December 2019 and rapidly led to a world-wide pandemic, known as COVID-

62

19 (1). The initial sequencing report found that this virus maintains 89.1% nucleotide

63

identity to SARS-like coronaviruses found in bats in China (1).

64
65

Coronaviruses (CoV) including SARS-CoV-2 contain large, ~ 30kb, positive-sense,

66

single-stranded RNA genomes with a unique genome organization structure. The 5’ end

67

of the genome contains two large open reading frames (ORFs), ORF1a and ORF1b.

68

ORF1a produces a large polyprotein, while ribosomal slippage at an RNA pseudoknot

69

structure and slippery sequence at the end of ORF1a occasionally leads to a frameshift

70

and subsequent translation of a joint ORF1a and ORF1b polyprotein (2). ORF1a and

71

ORF1ab polyproteins contain protease activity that can cleave the polyproteins into a

72

variety of nonstructural proteins (Nsp) capable of facilitating viral transcription and

73

replication and modulating host transcription and translation. Following ORF1b, there is

74

an arrangement of ORFs encoding structural and accessory proteins that tend to vary in

75

content and order across the CoV family. While structural proteins are incorporated into

76

emergent virions, accessory proteins are thought to be dispensable for replication in

77

vitro but to increase fitness in vivo (3-5).

78
79

Initial translation of ORF1ab can occur directly from incoming viral genomic RNA,

80

generating the ORF1a and ORF1ab polyproteins and initiating infection. However,

81

because the viral genome is so large, and because downstream ORFs are far from the

4

82

5’ end of the genome, effective translation of these ORFs requires the generation of

83

subgenomic RNAs (sgRNAs) (6). To generate these sgRNAs, it is thought that CoV

84

undergoes a process of discontinuous extension during synthesis of negative-stranded

85

RNA templates. As the virus-encoded RNA-dependent RNA polymerase progresses

86

from the 3’ end towards the 5’ end of the viral genome, it encounters transcriptional

87

regulatory sequences (TRS) upstream of each major ORF (TRS-B). Here, the

88

polymerase can skip to a similar TRS that is 3’ of a shared leader sequence within the

89

5’ UTR of the CoV genome (TRS-L). These antisense sgRNAs are then transcribed,

90

resulting in a series of tiered sgRNAs containing the same 5’ leader sequence (6).

91
92

Several studies have characterized SARS-CoV-2 sgRNAs using Nanopore direct RNA

93

sequencing (dRNAseq). In contrast to short-read sequencing, which can produce read

94

pairs of 150bp each, dRNAseq is capable of directly sequencing entire transcripts

95

including the full length of the viral genome (29903 bases). This allows dRNAseq to

96

identify RNA isoforms and variants that may be challenging to deconvolute using short-

97

read sequencing. Using nanopore sequencing, Taiaroa et al. identified eight major

98

sgRNAs, as well as a small number of non-canonical junctions between the 5’ leader

99

sequence and downstream regions of the SARS-CoV-2 genome (7). Kim et al. identified

100

a total of 9 distinct subgenomic RNAs, as well as a series of non-canonical subgenomic

101

RNAs (nc-sgRNAs) that contain unexpected junctions between 5’ and 3’ sequences (8).

102

Using short-read DNA nanoball sequencing data, they confirmed the existence of

103

noncanonical junctions at various sites across the genome (8). Davidson et al. identified

104

a series of transcripts encoding the nucleocapsid (N) protein, but with distinct small

105

internal deletions, and validated this finding with proteomic evidence (9).

106
107

While these previous studies identified non-canonical RNA junctions and unexpected

108

RNA species in isolation, there were no integrative analyses of the SARS-CoV-2

109

junctions. It is unclear if identified non-canonical junctions are broadly representative of

110

SARS-CoV-2 biology or if they are a result of dataset- or isolate-specific artifacts. Here,

111

we report an integrative analysis of eight independent SARS-CoV-2 transcriptomes

112

generated using three sequencing strategies, five host systems, and seven viral isolates

113

to comprehensively characterize the landscape of canonical and non-canonical sgRNAs

114

generated by SARS-CoV-2.

115
116

Results

117

Analysis of three independent dRNAseq datasets reveals canonical and

118

noncanonical junctions.

119

To determine the major RNA species present in SARS-CoV-2-infected cells, we applied

120

a uniform computational approach to three independent dRNAseq datasets from

121

Taiaroa et al., Kim et al., and Davidson et al. (7, 10, 11). To assess sgRNA presence,

122

we identified junction-spanning reads following read-mapping against the SARS-CoV-2

123

reference genome.

124
125

Analysis of the 5’ and 3’ locations of junctions separated by at least 1000 bases

126

revealed that the majority of junctions consist of a 5’ end originating in the 5’ UTR and a

6

127

3’ end at distinct sites in the 3’ region of the genome (Figure 1A-C). These represent

128

the canonical junctions between the leader sequence and 3’ sequences that generate

129

the major sgRNAs (6). Plotting the counts of 3’ junctions that contain a 5’ end within the

130

first 100 bases revealed eight prevalent junction points along the 3’ end of the genome

131

(Figure 1D-F), all of which are proximal to the TRS core sequence ACGAAC.

132

Interestingly, we observed that the 3’ junction peak and TRS-B closest to ORF6 lands

133

151 bases within the M ORF. Based on these junction analyses and the locations of

134

identified TRS body sites, predicted sgRNAs and their most 5’ gene or genes are shown

135

in Figure 1G. We predict 8 major sgRNAs based both on identification of the TRS core

136

sequence and presence of a dominant junction peak. In contrast to Kim et al. (8) but in

137

concordance with Taiaroa et al. (7) and Davidson et al. (9), we do not find evidence of a

138

prominent 3’ junction point near ORF7B (Figure 1D-F).

139
140

Many SARS-CoV-2 junctions are non-canonical.

141

Similar to observations by Kim et al. (8), we identified an unexpectedly diffuse pattern of

142

noncanonical junctions across the genome (Figure 1A-C, black arcs), suggesting that

143

there are many unexpected RNA species. Had there been only canonical junctions, the

144

arcs on this plot would be exclusively between the first 100 bases and defined points on

145

the x-axis (Figure 1A-F).

146
147

Because the transcriptomes in these long-read sequencing studies (7, 8, 11) all consist

148

of dRNAseq from infected Vero cells, we sought to confirm this observation in

149

independent transcriptomes from other SARS-CoV-2 isolates, in other host systems,

150

and using other sequencing technologies. To this end, we assessed five additional

151

transcriptomes generated from Vero cells (12), A549 cells (13), Calu3 cells (14),

152

bronchial organoids (15), and ferret nasal washings (13) using Illumina PolyA or total

153

RNA sequencing. Detailed information regarding each sample is detailed in the

154

methods. Junction analysis in these transcriptomes likewise revealed pervasive non-

155

canonical junctions (Supplementary Figure 1A-E). Quantification of the relative

156

abundance of canonical and non-canonical junctions in these transcriptomes revealed

157

that up to 33% of junctions are non-canonical in vitro (Figure 2A, Supplementary

158

Figure 1F). The transcriptome from a ferret’s nasal washing contained 51% non-

159

canonical junctions, indicating that non-canonical junctions are also produced in vivo.

160
161

We sought to assess if non-canonical junctions are driven by dataset-specific artifacts.

162

For example, it is possible that defective particles containing defective viral genomes

163

(DVGs), often with large internal deletions that increase their replicative fitness, could

164

accumulate during preparation of virion stocks (16) and generate the observed non-

165

canonical junctions during subsequent infections. If this was true, we would expect to

166

observe non-canonical junctions specific to a single virion preparation and accumulation

167

of these specific non-canonical junctions over the course of infection. To address this

168

possibility, we identified dataset-specific junctions by identifying junctions that are

169

differentially abundant across datasets (Figure 2B). This analysis revealed that the vast

170

majority of 5’ and 3’ non-canonical junctions are low abundance and are similarly

171

abundant across five independent SARS-CoV-2 sequencing studies (7-9, 12, 13)

172

(Figure 2C, D). This suggests that most non-canonical junctions are not driven by

173

dataset-specific artifacts.

174
175

However, we found that three 5’ junction sites in the Finkel et al. transcriptome and

176

three 3’ junctions in the Davidson et al. transcriptome were overrepresented (Figure

177

2C, D). Incorporating additional replicates of these transcriptomes and assessing the

178

percentage of non-canonical junctions at each site revealed that the Finkel et al.-

179

specific 5’ junctions are highly elevated in both Finkel et al. replicates relative to other

180

transcriptomes (Supplementary Figure 3A-C). In contrast, the three Davidson et al.-

181

specific 3’ junctions are present in other datasets but at slightly lower frequency

182

(Supplementary Figure 3D, E). The consistency of the Finkel et al.-specific junctions

183

across replicates and exclusion from other samples raises the possibility that these

184

junctions were generated from defective particles in the Finkel et al. virion preparation.

185
186

The proportion of non-canonical junctions increases over time in vitro.

187

Next, we assessed changes in junctions over time using the approach detailed in

188

Figure 3A using transcriptomes from early (4 or 5 hours post infection) and late (24

189

hours post infection) timepoints from Finkel et al. (12) and Emanual et al. (14). This

190

analysis revealed that there are large decreases in 5’ junctions originating at position

191

64, and in 3’ junctions ending in 28254 (proximal to the N TRS-B), with a smaller

192

decrease in 3’ junctions ending at 26467 (proximal to the M TRS-B) (Figure 3B,C).

193

Notably, the Finkel et al.-specific 5’ junction at 16971 increased in abundance over time.

194

In contrast, there were no specific large increases in percentage of junctions at other

9

195

positions (Figure 3B,C). Instead, there are small but widespread increases in non-

196

canonical junction sites throughout the SARS-CoV-2 genome (Figure 3D, E).

197

Quantification of the total percent changes of canonical and non-canonical junctions

198

revealed a large decrease in canonical N junctions and increase in non-canonical

199

junctions (Figure 3F, G). These results indicate that the abundance of non-canonical

200

junctions increases over time in vitro. It is unclear if a similar pattern occurs during

201

infection in vivo.

202
203

Non-canonical junctions are not associated with TRS-like homology.

204

While homology between the TRS-L and TRS-B is thought to be critical for generation

205

of canonical sgRNAs, the role of TRS-like homology in the generation of nc-sgRNAs is

206

unclear. To address this question, we determined the 30 bases surrounding the 5’ and

207

3’ sites of each junction and identified the longest continuous subsequence in common

208

between these sequence (Figure 4A). We found that junctions with a 3’ end landing

209

within 15 nucleotides of a TRS-B overwhelmingly have junction homology associated

210

with variants of the TRS core sequence (Figure 4B-D, blue). In contrast, junctions

211

landing within ORFs and not proximal to a TRS-B do not have a prevalent homologous

212

sequence (Figure 4B-D, red). The exception are intra-M junctions, whose homology is

213

a consequence of the location of the ORF6 TRS within the M ORF.

214
215

While there is not a single strong motif driving non-canonical, intra-ORF junctions, it is

216

still possible that non-canonical junctions are associated with junction-specific homology

217

between the 5’ and 3’ junction sites. To address this possibility, we tallied the length of

10

218

homology between the 5’ and 3’ sites of canonical and non-canonical junctions. This

219

analysis revealed that canonical junctions have markedly longer homology lengths

220

(mean >10 bases) than non-canonical junctions (mean < 5 bases) (Figure 4E-G).

221

Indeed, the homology lengths of non-canonical junctions are only slightly longer than

222

homology lengths between 100,000 random pairs of SARS-CoV-2-derived 30 base

223

sequences (Figure 4E-G). These data indicate that non-canonical junctions are not

224

associated with TRS-like homology.

225
226

sgRNAs containing only a 5’ region of ORF1a are produced in all studied in vitro

227

and in vivo infection systems.

228

Assessment of the three dRNAseq transcriptomes revealed evidence of sgRNAs that

229

contain only the 5’ region of ORF1a (Supplementary Figure 3A). This is similar to an

230

observation previously reported by Kim et al. (8). Inspection of read coverage of ORF1a

231

in these transcriptomes confirmed that there is elevated 5’ ORF1a coverage with

232

specific decreases in coverage concomitantly with sharp increases in junctions near

233

genome positions 1600 and 6000 (Figure 5A-C).

234
235

While there is clearly higher coverage of the 5’ region of ORF1a in the three dRNAseq

236

transcriptomes, it remained unclear if these 5’ ORF1a sgRNAs are a major percentage

237

of total ORF1a in the cell, or if this finding was due to a systematic bias favoring shorter

238

reads in nanopore sequencing. To address this question, we assessed ORF1a

239

coverage in four independent Illumina polyA-enriched RNAseq transcriptomes. Analysis

240

of these transcriptomes revealed a similar elevated 5’ ORF1a coverage and consistent

11

241

drops in coverage around genome positions 1600 and 6000 (Figure 5D-G). Importantly,

242

one of these transcriptomes is from bronchial organoids (Figure 5G) and one

243

transcriptome is from the nasal washings of an infected ferret (Figure 5F), suggesting

244

that 5’ ORF1a subgenomic RNAs can be produced in vivo and were not only due to

245

artifacts of highly replicative conditions in vitro. Furthermore, analysis of a transcriptome

246

generated from RNA that was not polyA-enriched revealed a consistent elevation in 5’

247

ORF1a coverage (Figure 5H), ruling out a systematic bias from polyA isolation. We

248

found that there is similar elevated 5’ ORF1a coverage in the circulating human

249

coronavirus CoV 229E (17) (Supplementary Figure 4), supporting the existence of 5’

250

ORF1a RNAs in other coronaviruses. All together, these data support the hypothesis

251

that subgenomic RNAs containing just the 5’ region of ORF1a are produced by SARS-

252

CoV-2.

253
254

Junctions have the potential to generate variant open reading frames.

255

To test the hypothesis that non-canonical junctions can result in variant open reading

256

frames (ORFs) in nc-sgRNAs, we assessed the ORF content of each read in the three

257

dRNAseq transcriptomes. Because dRNAseq can have an error rate of greater than

258

10% (18), we generated “coordinate-derived transcripts” by determining the start, end,

259

and junction coordinates of each raw transcript by mapping to SARS-CoV-2

260

(NC_045512.2) and extracting the associated genomic sequence. While this approach

261

is capable of overcoming sequencing errors and can resolve major RNA species, it is

262

not capable of resolving small or structurally complex RNA rearrangements. Because

263

the 5’ end of nanopore reads may be truncated due to technical factors during

264

sequencing (19), we leveraged the assumption that functional sgRNAs should contain

265

the 5’ leader sequence to identify reads generated from complete transcripts. While

266

excluding reads that don’t contain the leader sequence may have reduced sensitivity, it

267

prevents identification of variant ORFs as a consequence of truncated reads.

268
269

ORFs were predicted directly from the coordinate-derived transcripts, and ORFs of

270

unexpected length were identified as “variant”. Assessment of the relative abundance of

271

variant and canonical ORFs revealed evidence of variant ORFs of ORF1a/b, S, and M

272

(Figure 6A).

273
274

To characterize the identified M, S, and ORF1a ORF variants, we determined the stop

275

and start points of each ORF variant relative to their canonical counterparts (Figure 6D-

276

L). This analysis revealed that all theoretical M ORF variants were predicted to start at a

277

UUG start codon 42 amino acids before the end of the M gene and end at the canonical

278

stop codon (Figure 6D, G, J). M ORF variants make up between 7.9% and 19% of M

279

ORFs in the three dRNAseq datasets and are generated by the major junction point at

280

the ORF6 TRS sequence within the M reading frame (Figure 1D-F). If translated, M

281

ORF variants would lack the N-terminal transmembrane domains and contain regions

282

predicted to be present on the inside of the virion or in the cytosol. While the efficacy of

283

translation initiation from this start codon is unknown, it has an acceptable Kozak

284

consensus site with an A at the -3 position.

286

S ORF variants make up between 5.1% and 24.2% of all S ORFs identified in these

287

datasets (Figure 6A-C). The majority of S ORF variants are predicted from nc-sgRNAs

288

with 3’ junctions landing within the S ORF (Supplementary Figure 2D-F), resulting in

289

N-terminal truncations with theoretical AUG and non-AUG start codons (Figure 6E, H,

290

K). If translated, these variants would lack the N-terminal signal sequence (20) and,

291

especially considering the variations in ORF start sites, it is unclear if these ORFs

292

encode functional isoforms.

293
294

Our identification of ORF1a variants is consistent with the observed patterns of 5’

295

ORF1a coverage (Figure 5). The peak end position of identified ORF1a variant ORFs is

296

around amino acid position 500 (Figure 6F, I, L), consistent with the observed decrease

297

in read coverage around genome position 1600. This position falls within the NSP2

298

amino acid sequence suggesting that, if translated, many ORF1a ORF variants would

299

consist of NSP1 and N-terminal fragments of NSP2. Interestingly, we found that

300

approximately 1/3 of ORF1a variants are in-frame fusions with downstream ORFs,

301

encoding mostly N (Figure 6M-O).

Discussion

304

While prior studies have identified nc-sgRNAs in SARS-CoV-2 (8, 11) and other

305

coronaviruses (17), there has been no comprehensive analysis of SARS-CoV-2 nc-

306

sgRNAs. We conducted an integrative analysis of eight independent SARS-CoV-2

307

transcriptomes to catalogue unexpected, non-canonical RNA species. We show that

308

SARS-CoV-2 produces nc-sgRNAs, that these nc-sgRNAs increase in abundance over

309

time, and that they are not associated with TRS-like homology. We highlight strong

310

evidence supporting the existence of nc-sgRNAs containing only the 5’ region of ORF1a

311

and show that the presence of nc-sgRNAs can alter the landscape of viral ORFs.

312
313

We found that canonical sgRNAs are consistently produced across SARS-CoV-2

314

transcriptomes, and identify eight major sgRNAs encoding S, ORF3a, E, M, ORF6,

315

ORF7a/b, ORF8, and N. Each of these sgRNAs is supported by abundant 3’ junctions

316

originating at a TRS-B just upstream the associated ORF. Similar to other reports, we

317

do not find evidence of a major series of sgRNAs encoding ORF10 (7, 8, 11). We also

318

do not find strong evidence of a major group of sgRNAs encoding ORF7B despite the

319

presence of a TRS-core-like sequence (AAGAAC) proximal to the ORF7B start.

320
321

Interestingly, up to 33% of sgRNAs from infected cells in vitro are non-canonical. One

322

potential source of nc-sgRNAs are DVGs introduced by defective particles during

323

infection. These can accumulate during the propagation of virus stocks. While

324

information on the passaging of viral stocks is only available for four transcriptomes, at

325

least five of the six SARS-CoV-2 transcriptomes generated from cell lines were

326

generated following a low MOI infection, which may reduce the impact of defective

327

particles (21, 22). Indeed, while there is some variation in the absolute abundance of

328

non-canonical junctions across transcriptomes that may reflect dataset-specific factors,

329

the relative abundance of non-canonical junctions at most genomic positions is

330

generally similar. One exception is that dataset-specific junctions are found in the Finkel

331

et al. transcriptomes. In particular, there is a strong 5’ junction point at position 16971

15

332

that represents over 12% of non-canonical junctions in two Finkel et al. replicates but is

333

largely absent in other transcriptomes. A hypothesis that could explain this observation

334

is that there is a population of defective particles in the Finkel et al. virion preparation

335

that contain an internal deletion. This DVG, which is smaller than the full genome, may

336

have a replicative advantage during virus stock preparation (16). Indeed, the Finkel et

337

al.-specific junction at 16971 displays a relatively large increase in abundance over

338

time, in contrast to smaller and non-specific increases of non-canonical junctions at

339

other positions.

340
341

The consistent presence of non-canonical junctions across the SARS-CoV-2 genome in

342

independent transcriptomes suggests that the bulk of the observed nc-sgRNAs are not

343

dataset-specific but are generalizable to SARS-CoV-2 biology. Furthermore, their

344

nonspecific increase in abundance over time in vitro supports a model in which nc-

345

sgRNAs are generated nonspecifically and at higher frequencies later in infection. We

346

found that non-canonical junctions are not associated with TRS-like homology, raising

347

the possibility that there is another mechanism behind their formation. For example, it is

348

possible that factors such as RNA structure (23), accumulation of viral proteins, or

349

actions of the viral RdRp and associated cofactors (24) could influence nc-sgRNA

350

formation. Indeed, a recent study of the murine betacoronavirus MHV suggests that the

351

3’-to’5’ exoribonuclease Nsp14 influences recombination site selection of the viral RdRp

352

(24). Additional studies are necessary to gain a mechanistic understanding of the

353

factors that influence nc-sgRNA generation and to understand the phenotypic effects of

354

nc-sgRNAs on SARS-CoV-2 pathogenesis. Notably, considering that defective viral

355

genomes in negative-sense RNA viruses have been associated with antiviral immunity,

356

dendritic cell maturation, and interferon production (5, 16, 25, 26) it will be important to

357

assess if SARS-CoV-2 nc-sgRNAs are associated with immune activity.

358
359

Junctions in viral RNA change the landscape of viral ORFs. Because the ORF6 TRS-B

360

is located 151 bases into the M ORF, sgRNAs created using this TRS-B contain a 3’

361

region of M. There is a UUG located 41 codons prior to the end of M that will now be

362

situated prior to the ORF6 on these sgRNAs. While UUG is a relatively weak start

363

codon, there is potential that this UUG could stimulate translation of a C-terminal M

364

fragment or regulate the expression of the downstream ORF6 as an upstream ORF

365

(27). Additional studies are needed to understand if this M ORF variant is translated and

366

to understand if its UUG start codon influences ORF6 translation.

367
368

In addition to this M ORF variant, we found that some nc-sgRNAs contain S and ORF1a

369

ORF variants. Many of the S ORF variants would lack the N-terminal signal sequence

370

(28) and, especially considering the variation in the hypothetical start positions of these

371

variants, it is unclear if they are translated. Notably, subgenomic RNAs encoding variant

372

S ORFs have been reported for SARS-CoV-1 (29).

373
374

In contrast, the ORF1a ORF variants have a peak stop position around ORF1a amino

375

acid position 500, which correlates well with an observed decrease in ORF1a 5’

376

coverage around genome position 1600. There is strong support for the existence of 5’

377

ORF1a-containing nc-sgRNAs across all eight transcriptomes studied here. Although

17

378

there isn’t a strong peak of 5’ junctions at specific positions in the 5’ region of ORF1a,

379

the consistent decreases in coverage and concomitant increases in 5’ junctions around

380

positions 1600 and 6000 are notable. It is possible that there are biological factors at

381

these positions that mediate these generalized inflection points but, unlike TRS-

382

mediated homology, don’t concentrate junctions to a specific base. As posited by Kim et

383

al. (8), the existence of subgenomic RNAs with the 5’ end of ORF1a raises the

384

possibility that these nc-sgRNAs may influence the relative abundance of Nsps, making

385

this observation an important target for future study.

386
387

Conclusions

388

In conclusion, we show that SARS-CoV-2 generates nc-sgRNAs in vitro and in vivo, and

389

that these nc-sgRNAs are largely consistent across independent transcriptomes. We

390

show that nc-sgRNAs are not associated with TRS-like homology, suggesting there may

391

be a homology-independent mechanism driving their formation. Finally, we show that

392

non-canonical junctions have the potential to influence the landscape of viral ORFs, and

393

that there is especially strong support for nc-sgRNAs that contain only a 5’ portion of

394

ORF1a. Future studies are necessary to understand the mechanisms behind nc-sgRNA

395

formation, and to understand the influence of nc-sgRNAs on SARS-CoV-2

396

pathogenesis.

In the case of the Finkel et al. and Emanual et al. transcriptomes, the 24hpi samples

408

Determining junction coordinates.

409

Reads in all transcriptomes were mapped against the SARS-CoV-2 reference genome

410

(accession NC_045512.2) using minimap2 (30) and custom parameters detailed in

411

minimap_sars2.sh and inspired by Kim et al. (8), and unmapped reads were discarded.

412

The exceptions are the transcriptomes from Finkel et al. and Emanuel et al. – because

413

their read lengths were very short (60 and 72 bases in length respectively), mapping

414

was conducted with STAR (31) using settings detailed in star.sh.

415
416

The 5’ and 3’ junction positions of junction-spanning reads were determined with

417

generate_synthetic_transcripts.py. This script reads a BAM file and the SARS-CoV-2

418

genome fasta and, by parsing the BAM alignment CIGAR and start position, determines

419

the start, end, and junction coordinates of the alignment. Any minimap2-called deletion

420

or intron of at least 1000 bases in length was considered a junction. Junction

421

coordinates were then written to a tab-delimited output file for further analysis.

424

The 5’ and 3’ coordinates of each junction were processed in R (32), and figures

425

generated with ggplot2 (33). Gene-maps were generated using the gggenes R package

426

(34).

427
428

For the global distribution of reads in each transcriptome (Figure 1A-C,

429

Supplementary Figure 1A-F), specific 5’-3’ junctions that occur at least twice are

430

represented as arcs. Each inverted peak represents a histogram of 5’ or 3’ junctions at

431

each genome position, with a bin size of 100 bases – this means that the magnitude of

432

each peak represents the total number of 5’ or 3’ junctions within each 100 base span.

433

Code: global_junctions.Rmd

434
435

The distribution of major 3’ junctions (Figure 1D-F) was generated by plotting a

436

histogram of 3’ junction positions that occur after position 21000 and that have a 5’ end

437

prior to position 100. Bin-size is 20 bases. Code: canonical_3prime_junctions.Rmd

438
439

The percentage of non-canonical junctions in each transcriptome (Figure 2A,

440

Supplementary Figure 1G) was calculated by first assigning each individual 5’-3’

441

junction as canonical or non-canonical. A junction was considered to be canonical if it’s

442

5’ position was within 20 bases of the TRS-L core sequence ACGAAC (starting at

443

position 69), and it’s 3’ junction was within 15 bases of a TRS-B (defined by the

444

presence of the TRS core sequence). The percentage of total junctions that were

445

assigned as non-canonical was then determined. Code: global_junctions.Rmd

447

Identifying dataset-specific junctions (Figure 2).

448

The consistency of non-canonical junctions across transcriptomes (Figure 2C, D) was

449

determined separately for 5’ and 3’ junctions based on one replicate each from Taiaroa

450

et al., Kim et al., Davidson et al., Finkel et al., and Blanco-Melo et al. transcriptomes

451

generated from cells infected with SARS-CoV-2 in vitro. For each SARS-CoV-2 genome

452

position, the percentage of non-canonical junctions at that site was calculated for each

453

transcriptome (X). The mean (μ) and standard deviation (σ) of percentages at each site

454

across the five transcriptomes were then calculated. For each position in each

455

transcriptome, a z-score was calculated by subtracting the observed percentage by the

456

mean and dividing by the standard deviation ((X-μ)/σ). This process is visualized in

457

Figure 2B. Code: dataset_specific_junctions.Rmd

458
459

Change in junctions over time (Figure 3).

460

The change in junctions over time was determined based on datasets from Finkel et al.

461

(5hpi and 24hpi) and Emanuel et al. (4hpi and 24hpi). The percentage of junctions that

462

originate at each genome position was determined for each timepoint, and the absolute

463

difference between the two values was calculated. Notably, this analysis (Figure 3B, C)

464

focused on 5’ and 3’ counts at each position separately, such that a percentage of 5’

465

junctions and a percentage of 3’ junctions at each position was determined. To

466

determine the aggregated change in each class of junctions (Figure 3F,G), each 5’-3’

467

junction was assigned to a class based on the location of its 5’ and 3’ position. If a

468

junction’s 5’ position was located within 20 bases of the TRS-L, and it’s 3’ position was

469

located within 15 bases of a TRS-B, it was assigned to the ORF closest to the TRS-B.

470

Otherwise, the junction was assigned as non-canonical. The percentage of total

471

junctions in each class at the early timepoint was subtracted from the class percentages

472

at the late timepoint for each dataset. Code: junctions_over_time.Rmd

473
474

Assessing homology near 5’ and 3’ positions of each junction (Figure 4).

475

The identity and length of homologous sequences flanking the 5’ and 3’ sites of each

476

junction were determined by identifying the 30 bases flanking each junction site. The

477

longest identical subsequence between these two 30 base sequences was then

478

collected. For Figure 4B-D, the most common homology sequence was plotted for each

479

group of junctions. Here, a junction was considered canonical if it has a 3’ end within 15

480

bases of a canonical TRS-B or was assigned as “Within ORF” if it was otherwise within

481

an ORF. The exception were junctions with a 5’ end within ORF1a – these were

482

assigned to ORF1a. The total distribution of homology lengths was also determined for

483

canonical and non-canonical junctions (Figure 4E-G). To determine the random

484

distribution of homology lengths, all 30 base sequences (30mers) present in the SARS-

485

CoV-2 genome were determined. The longest identical subsequence between 100,000

486

random pairs of 30mers that are derived from at least 1000 bases apart on the genome

487

was determined. Code: TRS_plotting.Rmd

Analysis of ORFs on dRNAseq reads (Figure 6).

497

generate_synthetic_transcripts.py was used to generate “coordinate-derived transcripts”

498

from the SARS-CoV-2 mapped BAMs from the Taiaroa et al., Kim et al., and Davidson

499

et al. dRNAseq transcriptomes. This script reads a BAM file and the SARS-CoV-2

500

genome fasta and, by parsing the BAM alignment CIGAR and start position, determines

501

the start, end, and junction coordinates of the alignment. Coordinate-derived transcripts

502

were created by using these coordinates to retrieve the associated sequence from the

503

SARS-CoV-2 genome. Any minimap2-called deletion or intron of at least 1000 bases in

504

length was considered a junction. All coordinate-derived transcripts were then aligned

505

against a minimal leader sequence fragment (5’ –

506

CTTCCCAGGTAACAAACCAACCAACTTTCGATCTCTTGTAGATCTGTTCTC – 3’)

507

using blastn (36). This minimal sequence was used instead of the full leader sequence

508

because inspection of 5’ coverage in the three long-read datasets revealed a significant

509

drop in coverage at the end of this sequence. Transcripts with an alignment of at least

510

45 nucleotides in length and a percent identity of at least 85%, and that contain the start

511

of this sequence within the first 50 nucleotides of the transcript, were kept. Transcripts

512

not containing this leader sequence were discarded.

514

ORFs were called directly from each transcript using Prodigal (37), using parameters

515

listed in prodigal.sh. ORFs were allowed to initiate from any nUG start codon, were not

516

required to be the most 5’ ORF on each transcript and were only reported if they are at

517

least 30 codons in length. Each ORF was translated into amino acid sequence using

518

prodigal_to_orf_direct.py. If multiple Prodigal-predicted ORFs contained an overlapping

519

amino acid sequence, the longest ORF was output. Each ORF was output in fasta

520

format and labeled with transcript of origin and coordinates of the ORF on the transcript.

521
522

The amino acid sequence of each ORF was then mapped against canonical SARS-

523

CoV-2 proteins (from accession NC_045512.2) as well as Prodigal-predicted

524

unannotated ORFs from the SARS-CoV-2 genome using DIAMOND (38). DIAMOND

525

parameters are described in diamond.sh and include an E-value threshold of 10. During

526

downstream analysis, alignments were considered valid if the aligned portions

527

maintained at least 95% amino acid identity to the reference protein.

528
529

Various statistics of each ORF, including alignment information, the start position of the

530

ORF on the transcript, and fusion information, were generated from the DIAMOND

531

alignment file using parse_orf_assignments.py. An ORF was considered variant if it was

532

not the same length as the canonical protein, with a notable exception. Because there

533

are alternative start codons upstream of some annotated genes, and Prodigal would call

534

ORFs using these start codons if they are present on a transcript, ORFs were allowed

Figure 1. SARS-CoV-2 generates a defined population of canonical subgenomic

588

RNAs.

589

A-C) For each location on the viral genome, a histogram of 5’ and 3’ junctions at that

590

position was calculated and plotted as an inverse peak. The histogram bin size is

591

100 bases, meaning each inverse peak represents the cumulative count of 5’ or 3’

592

junctions occurring within that span. Curved lines represent the 5’ and 3’ locations of

593

junctions that occur at least twice. Red curves represent canonical junctions, black

594

curves represent non-canonical junctions. “Taiaroa” (7), “Kim” (8), and “Davidson”

595

(9) represent the three independent SARS-CoV-2 dRNAseq datasets investigated.

596

D-F) A histogram of 3’ junctions past position 21000 with a 5’ end before position

597

100 are plotted. Dashed lines indicate the start coordinates of annotated viral genes.

598

Bin-size is 20 bases.

599

G) Based on junction analysis, the predicted major species of virus-produced RNAs

600

are represented. The most 5’ gene or genes on each subgenomic RNA is listed.

607

Finkel and Blanco-Melo are Illumina PolyA RNAseq.

608

B) Illustration of computational approach to determine the consistency of 5’ and

609

3’ junction points across independent datasets. The percentage of non-canonical

610

junctions at each genome position in each dataset was determined (X). The

611

mean (μ) and standard deviation (σ) of percentages at each position across the

612

five datasets was calculated. For each position in each dataset, the Z-score was

613

calculated as (X-μ)/σ (i.e. the number of standard deviations away from the

614

mean), and the percentages and Z-scores for each position in each dataset were

615

plotted.

616

C, D) Each point represents the percentage and Z-score of one position in one

617

dataset. For each position in the SARS-CoV-2 genome, the percentage and Z-

618

score of non-canonical junctions with a 5’ end (D) or a 3’ end (E) was determined

619

as described above for five independent datasets: Taiaroa, Kim, Davidson,

620

Finkel, and Blanco-Melo. Points with a percentage above 4% of non-canonical

621

junctions and a Z-score above 1 were highlighted.

A) Illustration of computational approach used to determine change in junction

625

percentages over time. For each position in the SARS-CoV-2 genome and

626

separately for 5’ and 3’ junctions, the number of junctions at that position was

627

calculated. Using these numbers, the percentage of 5’ or 3’ junctions falling at

628

each position was calculated. The change in junction percentage at each position

629

is defined as the difference between the position’s junction percentage at the late

630

and early timepoints, and this junction change was plotted for each position.

631

B-E) The change in junction percentage for 5’ (orange) and 3’ (blue) junctions

632

over time in the Finkel (B, D) and Emanuel (C, E) datasets was determined as

633

described above. Changes in the percentage of junctions Positions with at

634

change greater than 2.5% are annotated with text on the plot. Panels D and E

635

are zoomed in versions of B and C.

636

F, G) Junctions were assigned into groups based on their 5’ and 3’ junction

637

positions. If a junction had a 5’ end within 20 bases of the TRS-L and within 15

638

bases of a TRS-B, it was considered a canonical junction belonging to the ORF

639

with a start closest to the TRS-B. Otherwise, it was considered non-canonical.

640

The percentage of junctions falling into each category was calculated for early

641

and late timepoints, and the difference between each category’s percentage in

642

the late vs early timepoint was plotted.

A) Illustration of computational approach used to assess homologous sequences

646

between the 5’ and 3’ junction points. For each of the three dRNAseq datasets,

647

the 30 bases flanking the 5’ and 3’ junction points were assessed, and the

648

longest homologous sequence between these two 30 base regions was

649

determined.

650

B-D) Homologous sequences present in the 15 bases on either side of the 5’ and

651

3’ ends of each junction. Junctions are classified by the location of their 3’ end –

652

if this is within 15 bases of the canonical TRS site or if it falls within a gene it is

653

assigned accordingly. The only exception is ORF1a – junctions with a 5’ end

654

originating in ORF1a are assigned to ORF1a. Labels represent the most

655

common homologous sequence between the ends of each junction. The core

656

TRS sequence ACGAAC is underlined.

657

E-G) The length of the longest homologous sequence for canonical (C) and non-

658

canonical (NC) are plotted. Here, junctions were considered canonical if they

659

have a 5’ end within 20 nucleotides of the TRS-L and a 3’ end within 15

660

nucleotides of a TRS-B. (R) represents random homology lengths. The points for

661

(R) were calculated by first extracting all possible 30 base sequences (30mers)

662

from the SARS-CoV-2 genome, and then assessing the length of the longest

663

homologous sequence between 100,000 random pairs of 30mers that are

664

separated by at least 1000 bases on the genome. Within each column, the

665

relative width of each band represents the relative abundance of junctions with

666

each homology length. The value at the top of each column is the mean

667

homology length.

Figure 6. Junctions have the potential to generate variant open reading frames.

679

A-C) ORFs were predicted directly from transcript-derived reads for the three

680

dRNAseq datasets. Each ORF was aligned against the protein sequences of

681

canonical SARS-CoV-2 genes using the DIAMOND aligner. Variant ORFs were

682

defined as ORFs that were assigned to a canonical SARS-CoV-2 protein but had

683

an unexpected start or stop position, while perfectly-aligning ORFs were

684

considered canonical. The percentage of canonical and variant ORFs for each

685

protein is plotted.

686

D-L) Schematics of M, N, and ORF1ab are displayed with the approximate

687

location of predicted transmembrane domains labeled in red. A histogram of the

688

start and end sites of variant M, N, and ORF1ab ORFs are displayed. Start sites

689

of each variant ORF are on top, and end sites are on the bottom of each panel.

702

A-E) For each location on the viral genome, a histogram of 5’ and 3’ junctions at

703

that position was calculated and plotted as an inverse peak. The histogram bin

704

size is 100 bases, meaning each inverse peak represents the cumulative count

705

of 5’ or 3’ junctions occurring within that span. Curved lines represent the 5’ and

706

3’ locations of junctions that occur at least twice. Red curves represent canonical

707

junctions, black curves represent non-canonical junctions.

708

F) The percentage of junctions that are canonical in the Suzuki (Bronchial

709

organoids) and Blanco-Melo (Ferret) datasets was determined. Junctions were

710

assigned as canonical if their 5’ location was within 20 bases of the TRS-L and

711

their 3’ location within 15 bases of a TRS-B, and otherwise assigned as non-

Figure 1. SARS-CoV-2 generates a defined population of canonical subgenomic RNAs.
A-C) For each location on the viral genome, a histogram of 5’ and 3’ junctions at that position was calculated and
plotted as an inverse peak. The histogram bin size is 100 bases, meaning each inverse peak represents the
cumulative count of 5’ or 3’ junctions occurring within that span. Curved lines represent the 5’ and 3’ locations of
junctions that occur at least twice. Red curves represent canonical junctions, black curves represent non-canonical
junctions. “Taiaroa”, “Kim”, and “Davidson” represent the three independent SARS-CoV-2 dRNAseq datasets
investigated.
D-E) A histogram of 3’ junctions past position 21000 with a 5’ end before position 100 are plotted. Dashed lines
indicate the start coordinates of annotated viral genes. Bin-size is 20 bases
G) Based on junction analysis, the predicted major species of virus-produced RNAs are represented. The most 5’
gene or genes on each subgenomic RNA islisted.

Figure 2. Non-canonical junctions are consistent across independent datasets.
A) Percentage of junctions that are non-canonical in five independent datasets. Junctions were assigned as
canonical if their 5’ location was within 20 bases of the TRS-L and their 3’ location within 15 bases of a TRS-B, and
otherwise assigned as non-canonical. Taiaroa, Kim, and Davidson are dRNAseq, while Finkel and Blanco-Melo are
Illumina PolyA RNAseq.
B) Description of computational approach to determine the consistency of 5’ and 3’ junction points across
independent datasets. The percentage of non-canonical junctions at each genome position in each dataset was
determined (X). The mean (μ) and standard deviation (σ) of percentages at each position across the five datasets
was calculated. For each position in each dataset, the Z-score was calculated as (X-μ)/σ (i.e. the number of standard
deviations away from the mean), and the percentages and Z-scores for each position in each dataset were plotted.
C, D) Each point represents the percentage and Z-score of one position in one dataset. For each position in the
SARS-CoV-2 genome, the percentage and Z-score of non-canonical junctions with a 5’ end (D) or a 3’ end (E) was
determined as described above for five independent datasets: Taiaroa, Kim, Davidson, Finkel, and Blanco-Melo.
Points with a percentage above 4% of non-canonical junctions and a Z-score above 1 were highlighted.

Figure 3. Non-canonical junctions accumulate over time in vitro.
A) Description of computational approach used to determine change in junction percentages over time. For each
position in the SARS-CoV-2 genome and separately for 5’ and 3’ junctions, the number of junctions at that position
was calculated. Using these numbers, the percentage of 5’ or 3’ junctions falling at each position was calculated.
The change in junction percentage at each position is defined as the difference between the position’s junction
percentage at the late and early timepoints, and this junction change was plotted for each position.
B-E) The change in junction percentage for 5’ (orange) and 3’ (blue) junctions over time in the Finkel (B, D) and
Emanuel (C, E) datasets was determined as described above. Changes in the percentage of junctions Positions
with at change greater than 2.5% are annotated with text on the plot. Figures D and E are zoomed in versions of
A and B.
F, G) Junctions were assigned into groups based on their 5’ and 3’ junction positions. If a junction had a 5’ end
within 20 bases of the TRS-L and within 15 bases of a TRS-B, it was considered a canonical junction belonging to
the ORF with a start closest to the TRS-B. Otherwise, it was considered non-canonical. The percentage of
junctions falling into each category was calculated for early and late timepoints, and the difference between each
category’s percentage in the late vs early timepoint was plotted.

Figure 4. Non-canonical junctions are not associated with TRS-like homology.
A) Description of computational approach used to assess homologous sequences between the 5’ and 3’ junction points. For
each of the three dRNAseq datasets, the 30 bases flanking the 5’ and 3’ junction points were assessed, and the longest
homologous sequence between these two 30 base regions was determined.
B-D) Homologous sequences present in the 15 bases on either side of the 5’ and 3’ ends of each junction. Junctions are
classified by the location of their 3’ end – if this is within 15 bases of the canonical TRS site or if it falls within a gene it is
assigned accordingly. The only exception is ORF1a – junctions with a 5’ end originating in ORF1a are assigned to ORF1a.
Labels represent the most common homologous sequence between the ends of each junction. The core TRS sequence
ACGAAC is underlined.
E-G) The length of the longest homologous sequence for canonical (C) and non-canonical (NC) are plotted. Here, junctions were
considered canonical if they have a 5’ end within 20 nucleotides of the TRS-L and a 3’ end within 15 nucleotides of a TRS-B.
(R) represents random homology lengths. The points for (R) were calculated by first extracting all possible 30 base sequences
(30mers) from the SARS-CoV-2 genome, and then assessing the length of the longest homologous sequence between 100,000
random pairs of 30mers that are separated by at least 1000 bases on the genome. Within each column, the relative width of
each band represents the relative abundance of junctions with each homology length. The value at the top of each column is the
mean homology length.

Figure 6. Junctions have the potential to generate variant open reading frames.
A-C) ORFs were predicted directly from transcript-derived reads for the three dRNAseq datasets, and each ORF was aligned against the
protein sequences of canonical SARS-CoV-2 genes using the DIAMOND aligner. Variant ORFs were defined as ORFs that were assigned to a
canonical SARS-CoV-2 protein but had an unexpected start or stop position, while perfectly-aligning ORFs were considered canonical. The
percentage of canonical and variant ORFs for each protein is plotted.
D-L) Schematics of M, N, and ORF1ab are displayed with the approximate location of predicted transmembrane domains labeled in red. A
histogram of the start and end sites of variant M, N, and ORF1ab ORFs are displayed. Start sites of each variant ORF are on top, and end
sites are on the bottom of each panel. Percentages represent the percentage of each ORF that is variant. Histogram bin-sizes: M, 1; N, 10 ;
ORF1ab, 20. NTD: N-terminal domain. RBD: Receptor binding domain. CD: Connector domain. NSP: Nonstructural protein.
M-O) The identity of ORF1a-fusion partners is plotted on the Y axis, with the count of such fusions on the X axis. The top 10 fusion partners
for each sample are represented. Color indicates if the fusion partner is on the N and C terminus of ORF1a, if the terminus is ambiguous, or
if the fusion is a “self” fusion between an upstream and downstream region of ORF1a. The percentage notes the percent of ORFs assigned to
ORF1a that have a fusion.

Supplementary Figure 1. There is evidence of non-canonical junctions in diverse datasets.
A-E) For each location on the viral genome, a histogram of 5’ and 3’ junctions at that position was calculated and
plotted as an inverse peak. The histogram bin size is 100 bases, meaning each inverse peak represents the
cumulative count of 5’ or 3’ junctions occurring within that span. Curved lines represent the 5’ and 3’ locations of
junctions that occur at least twice. Red curves represent canonical junctions, black curves represent non-canonical
junctions.
F) The percentage of junctions that are canonical in the Suzuki (Bronchial organoids) and Blanco-Melo (Ferret)
datasets was determined. Junctions were assigned as canonical if their 5’ location was within 20 bases of the
TRS-L and their 3’ location within 15 bases of a TRS-B, and otherwise assigned as non-canonical.

A-E) The percentage of non-canonical junctions at each SARS-CoV-2 genome position is plotted. Plots A-C
show the percentage of 5’ junctions at each position, while D-E show the percentage of 3’ junctions at each
position. The plotted samples include three replicates from Blanco-Melo et al., Davidson et al, two replicate
from Finkel et al, and the Kim and Taiaroa et al datasets.

Supplementary Figure 3. Subgenomic RNAs containing non-canonical junctions are present in three
independent dRNAseq datasets.
A-F) Subgenomic RNAs with 5’ junctions occurring in ORF1a (A-C) or 3’ junctions occurring in S (D-F)
are plotted for the three dRNAseq datasets. Each row is a read, and regions in black indicate the read
contains that sequence.
