Abstract:
Protection against SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-related emergent zoonotic coronaviruses is urgently
needed. We made homotypic nanoparticles displaying the receptor-binding domain (RBD) of
SARS-CoV-2 or co-displaying SARS-CoV-2 RBD along with RBDs from animal
betacoronaviruses that represent threats to humans (mosaic nanoparticles; 4-8 distinct RBDs).
Mice immunized with RBD-nanoparticles, but not soluble antigen, elicited cross-reactive binding
and neutralization responses. Mosaic-RBD-nanoparticles elicited antibodies with superior crossreactive recognition of heterologous RBDs compared to sera from immunizations with
homotypic SARS-CoV-2–RBD-nanoparticles or COVID-19 convalescent human plasmas.
Moreover, sera from mosaic-RBD–immunized mice neutralized heterologous pseudotyped
coronaviruses equivalently or better after priming than sera from homotypic SARS-CoV-2–
RBD-nanoparticle immunizations, demonstrating no immunogenicity loss against particular
RBDs resulting from co-display. A single immunization with mosaic-RBD-nanoparticles
provides a potential strategy to simultaneously protect against SARS-CoV-2 and emerging
zoonotic coronaviruses.

Main Text:
SARS-CoV-2, a newly-emergent betacoronavirus, resulted in a global pandemic in 2020,
infecting millions and causing the respiratory disease COVID-19 (1, 2). Two other zoonotic
betacoronaviruses, SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, also resulted in outbreaks within the last 20
years (3). All three viruses presumably originated in bats (4), with SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV
adapting to intermediary animal hosts before jumping to humans. SARS-like viruses circulate in
bats and serological surveillance of people living near caves where bats carry diverse
coronaviruses demonstrates direct transmission of SARS-like viruses with pandemic potential (5),
suggesting a pan-coronavirus vaccine is needed to protect against future outbreaks and
pandemics. In particular, the bat WIV1 and SHC014 strains are thought to represent an ongoing
threat to humans (6, 7).

Most current SARS-CoV-2 vaccine candidates include the spike trimer (S), the viral protein that
mediates target cell entry after one or more of its receptor-binding domains (RBDs) adopt an “up”
position to bind a host receptor (Fig. 1A). The RBDs of human coronaviruses SARS-CoV-2,
SARS-CoV, HCoV-NL63, and related animal coronaviruses (WIV1 and SCH014) use
angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) as their host receptor (1, 8, 9), while other
coronaviruses use receptors such as dipeptidyl peptidase 4 (10) or sialic acids (11, 12).
Consistent with its function in viral entry, S is the primary target of neutralizing antibodies (1322), with many targeting the RBD (14-18, 21-26).

Multivalent display of antigen enhances B-cell responses and can provide longer-lasting
immunity than monovalent antigens (27, 28), thus protein-based vaccine candidates often

involve a nanoparticle that enables antigen multimerization. Many nanoparticles and coupling
strategies have been explored for vaccine design (29), with “plug and display” strategies being
especially useful (30, 31). In one such approach, multiple copies of an engineered protein
domain called SpyCatcher fused to subunits of a virus-like particle form spontaneous isopeptide
bonds to purified antigens tagged with a 13-residue SpyTag (29-32). The SpyCatcher-SpyTag
system was used to prepare multimerized SARS-CoV-2 RBD or S trimer that elicited high titers
of neutralizing antibodies (33, 34). Although promising for protection against SARS-CoV-2,
coronavirus reservoirs in bats suggest future cross-species transmission (6, 7, 35), necessitating a
vaccine that protects against emerging coronaviruses as well as SARS-CoV-2. Here we prepared
SpyCatcher003-mi3 nanoparticles (31, 36) simultaneously displaying SpyTagged RBDs from
human and animal coronaviruses to evaluate whether mosaic particles can elicit cross-reactive
antibody responses, as previously demonstrated for influenza head domain mosaic particles (37).
We show that mice immunized with homotypic or mosaic nanoparticles produced broad binding
and neutralizing responses, in contrast to plasma antibodies elicited in humans by SARS-CoV-2
infection. Moreover, mosaic nanoparticles showed enhanced heterologous binding and
neutralization properties against human and bat SARS-like betacoronaviruses (sarbecoviruses)
compared with homotypic SARS-CoV-2 nanoparticles.

We used a study of sarbecovirus RBD receptor usage and cell tropism (38) to guide our choice of
RBDs for co-display on mosaic particles. From 29 RBDs that were classified into distinct clades
(clades 1, 2, 1/2, and 3) (38), we identified diverse RBDs from SARS-CoV, WIV1, and SHC014
(clade 1), SARS-CoV-2 (clade 1/2), Rs4081, Yunnan 2011 (Yun11), and Rf1 (clade 2), and
BM48-31 (clade 3), of which SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV are human coronaviruses and the

rest are bat viruses originating in China or Bulgaria (BM48-31). We also included RBDs from
the GX pangolin clade 1/2 coronavirus (referred to here as pang17) (39), RaTG13, the bat clade
1/2 virus most closely related to SARS-CoV-2 (40), RmYN02, a clade 2 bat virus from China
(41), and BtKY72, a Kenyan bat clade 3 virus (42). Mapping of the sequence conservation across
selected RBDs showed varying degrees of sequence identity (68-95%), with highest sequence
variability in residues corresponding to the SARS-CoV-2 ACE2 receptor-binding motif (Fig. 1AD; fig. S1). We chose 8 of the 12 RBDs for making three types of mosaic nanoparticles: mosaic4a (coupled to SARS-2, RaTG13, SHC014, and Rs4081 RBDs), mosaic-4b (coupled to pang17,
RmYN02, RF1, and WIV1 RBDs), and mosaic-8 (coupled to all eight RBDs), and compared
them with homotypic mi3 particles constructed from SARS-CoV-2 RBD alone (homotypic
SARS-2). RBDs from SARS, Yun11, BM-4831, and BtKY72, which were not coupled to mosaic
particles, were used to evaluate sera for cross-reactive responses.

SpyTag003-RBDs were coupled to SpyCatcher003-mi3 (60 potential conjugation sites) (36, 43)
to make homotypic and mosaic nanoparticles (Fig 2A). Particles were purified by size exclusion
chromatography (SEC) and analyzed by SDS-PAGE, revealing monodisperse SEC profiles and
nearly 100% conjugation (Fig. 2B,C). Representative RBDs were conjugated to SpyCatcher003mi3 with similar or identical efficiencies (fig. S2), suggesting that mosaic particles contained
approximately equimolar mixtures of different RBDs.

We immunized mice with either soluble SARS-CoV-2 spike trimer (SARS-2 S), nanoparticles
displaying only SARS-2 RBD (homotypic SARS-2), nanoparticles co-displaying RBDs (mosaic4a, mosaic-4b, mosaic-8), or unconjugated nanoparticles (mi3). IgG responses were evaluated

after prime or boost immunizations (Fig. 3A) by ELISA against SARS-2 S (Fig. 3B) or a panel
of RBDs (Fig. 3C-F; fig. S3). Sera from unconjugated nanoparticle-immunized animals (black in
Fig. 3, fig. S3) showed no responses above background. Anti-SARS-2 S trimer and anti-SARS-2
RBD serum responses were similar (Fig. 3B,C), demonstrating that antibodies elicited against
RBDs can access their epitopes on SARS-2 S trimer. We also conducted in vitro neutralization
assays using a pseudotyped virus assay that quantitatively correlates with authentic virus
neutralization (44) for strains known to infect 293TACE2 target cells (SARS-CoV-2, SARS, WIV1
and SHC104). Neutralization and ELISA titers were significantly correlated (fig. S4), thus
suggesting ELISAs are predictive of neutralization results when pseudotyped neutralization
assays were not possible due to unknown viral entry receptor usage.

Mice immunized with soluble SARS-2 S trimer (brown bars) showed no binding or
neutralization except for autologous responses against SARS-2 after boosting (Fig. 3C-F). By
contrast, sera from RBD-nanoparticle–immunized animals (red, green, yellow, and blue bars)
exhibited binding to all RBDs (Fig. 3C-F; fig. S3A) and neutralization against all four strains
after boosting (Fig. 3C-E), consistent with increased immunogenicities of multimerized antigen
on nanoparticles versus soluble antigen (27, 28). Homotypic SARS-2 nanoparticles, but not
soluble SARS-2 trimer, induced heterologous responses to zoonotic RBDs and neutralization of
heterologous coronaviruses (Fig. 3D-F). To address whether co-display of SARS-2 RBD along
with other RBDs on mosaic-4a and mosaic-8 versus homotypic display of SARS-2 RBD
(homotypic SARS-2) diminished anti-SARS-2 responses, we compared SARS-2–specific ELISA
and neutralization titers for mosaic versus homotypic immunizations (Fig. 3C): there were no
significant differences in IgG anti-SARS-2 titers for animals immunized with homotypic (red in

Fig. 3C) versus mosaic nanoparticles (green and blue in Fig. 3C). Thus there was no advantage
of immunization with a homotypic RBD-nanoparticle versus a mosaic-nanoparticle that included
SARS-2 RBD in terms of the magnitude of immune responses against SARS-2.

We next compared serum responses against matched RBDs (RBDs present on an injected
nanoparticle; gray horizontal shading) versus mismatched RBDs (RBDs not present on injected
nanoparticle; red horizontal shading) (Fig. 3; fig. S3). Although SARS-2 RBD was not presented
on mosaic-4b, antibody titers elicited by mosaic-4b immunization (yellow) were not significantly
different than titers elicited by matched nanoparticle immunizations (homotypic SARS-2 (red),
mosaic-4a (green), and mosaic-8 (blue)), and sera from boosted mosaic-4b–immunized mice
neutralized SARS-2 pseudovirus (Fig. 3C). In other matched versus mismatched comparisons,
sera showed binding and neutralization of SHC014 and WIV1 regardless of whether these RBDs
were included on the injected nanoparticle (Fig. 3D), underscoring sharing of common epitopes
among RBDs (Fig. 1A).

Demonstrating advantages of mosaic versus homotypic SARS-2 nanoparticles, sera from
mosaic-8–immunized mice bound SHC014 and WIV1 RBDs significantly better after the prime
than sera from homotypic SARS-2–immunized mice and retained better binding to SHC014
RBD after boosting (Fig. 3D). Thus the potential increased avidity of the homotypic SARS-2
nanoparticle displaying only one type of RBD over the mosaic-8 nanoparticles did not confer
increased breadth. Moreover, mosaic-8–immunized and boosted sera were 7-44–fold more potent
than sera from homotypic SARS-2–immunized animals in neutralizing SHC014 and WIV1 (Fig.
3D). Neutralization of the SHC014 and WIV1 pseudoviruses by mosaic-8 sera suggests that

combining RBDs on a mosaic nanoparticle does not diminish the immune response against a
particular RBD, also suggested by ELISA binding of sera to Rs4081 and RaTG13 (fig. S3A,B).

To further address whether RBD-nanoparticles elicited antibodies that recognized totally
mismatched strains and SARS-CoV-2 RBD mutants, we evaluated sera for binding to SARS,
Yun11, BM-4831, and BtKY72 RBDs (Fig. 3E,F), SARS-2 RBD mutants (fig. S3C), MERSCoV RBD (fig. S3D), and for neutralization in SARS pseudovirus assays (Fig. 3E). We found no
reductions in SARS-2 RBD binding as a result of mutations (Y453F, the “Danish mink variant”
(45) or a Q493K/Q498Y/P499T triple mutant (46)) (fig. S3C), no binding of any elicited sera to
MERS-CoV RBD (fig. S3D), and higher and more cross-reactive antibody responses for mosaic
immunizations compared with homotypic SARS-2 immunizations: e.g., mosaic-8–primed and
boosted animals showed significantly higher titers against SARS RBD than sera from homotypic
SARS-2–immunized mice (Fig. 3E). After the prime, sera from the homotypic SARS-2–
immunized animals did not neutralize SARS, whereas the mosaic-4b and mosaic-8 sera were
neutralizing (Fig. 3E), perhaps facilitated by these nanoparticles including WIV1 RBD, which is
related by 95% amino acid identity to SARS RBD (Fig. 1D). After boosting, SARS-2 and
mosaic-4a sera were also neutralizing, although titers were ~4-fold lower than for mosaic-8–
immunized animals (Fig. 3E). ELISA titers against other mismatched RBDs (Yun11, BM-4831,
BtKY72) were significantly higher for sera collected after mosaic-8 priming compared to sera
from homotypic SARS-2 priming, and heightened binding was retained after boosting (Fig. 3F).
Thus mosaic nanoparticles, particularly mosaic-8, induce higher antibody titers against
mismatched RBDs than homotypic SARS-2 nanoparticles, again favoring the co-display
approach for inducing broader anti-coronavirus responses, especially after a single prime.

We investigated the potential for cross-reactive recognition using flow cytometry to ask whether
B-cell receptors on IgG+ splenic B-cells from RBD-nanoparticle–boosted animals could
simultaneously recognize RBDs from SARS-2 and Rs4081 (related by 70% sequence identity)
(Fig. 1D; fig. S5). Whereas control animals were negative, all other groups showed B-cells that
recognized SARS-2 and Rs4081 RBDs simultaneously, suggesting the existence of antibodies
that cross-react with both RBDs (fig. S5E).

To compare antibodies elicited by RBD-nanoparticle immunization to antibodies elicited by
SARS-CoV-2 infection, we repeated ELISAs against the RBD panel using IgGs from COVID-19
plasma donors (47) (Fig. 4). Most of the convalescent plasmas showed detectable binding to
SARS-2 RBD (Fig. 4A). However, binding to other sarbecovirus RBDs (RaTG13, SHC014,
WIV1, Rs4081 and BM-4831) was significantly weaker than binding to SARS 2 RBD, with
many human plasma IgGs showing no binding above background (Fig. 4B-G). In addition,
although convalescent plasma IgGs neutralized SARS-CoV-2 pseudoviruses, they showed weak
or no neutralization of SARS, SHC014, or WIV1 pseudoviruses (Fig. 4H). These results are
consistent with little to no cross-reactive recognition of RBDs from zoonotic coronavirus strains
resulting from SARS-CoV-2 infection in humans.

In conclusion, we confirmed that multimerization of RBDs on nanoparticles enhances
immunogenicity compared with soluble antigen (33, 48) and further showed that homotypic
SARS-2 nanoparticle immunization produced IgG responses that bound zoonotic RBDs and
neutralized heterologous coronaviruses after boosting. By contrast, soluble SARS-2 S

immunization and natural infection with SARS-CoV-2 resulted in weak or no heterologous
responses in plasmas. Co-display of SARS-2 RBD along with diverse RBDs on mosaic
nanoparticles showed no disadvantages for eliciting neutralizing antibodies against SARS-CoV-2
compared with homotypic SARS-2 nanoparticles, suggesting mosaic nanoparticles as a candidate
vaccine to protect against COVID-19. Furthermore, compared with homotypic SARS-2 RBD
particles, the mosaic co-display strategy demonstrated advantages for eliciting neutralizing
antibodies against zoonotic sarbecoviruses, thus potentially also providing protection against
emerging coronaviruses with human spillover potential., Neutralization of matched and
mismatched strains was observed after mosaic priming, suggesting a single injection of a mosaicRBD nanoparticle might be sufficient in a vaccine. Since COVID-19 convalescent plasmas
showed little to no recognition of coronavirus RBDs other than SARS-CoV-2, COVD-19–
induced immunity in humans may not protect against another emergent coronavirus. However,
the mosaic nanoparticles described here could be used as described or easily adapted to present
RBDs from newly-discovered zoonotic coronaviruses.

Materials and Methods

Phylogenetic tree. A sequence alignment of coronavirus RBD domains was made using Clustal
Omega (51). A phylogenetic tree was calculated from this amino acid alignment using PhyML
3.0 (52), and a figure of this tree was made using PRESTO (http://www. atgcmontpellier.fr/presto).

Expression of RBD and S proteins. Mammalian expression vectors encoding the RBDs of SARSCoV-2

(GenBank MN985325.1; S protein residues 319-539) and SARS-CoV S (GenBank

AAP13441.1; residues 318-510) with an N-terminal human IL-2 or Mu phosphatase signal
peptide were previously described (47). Expression vectors were constructed similarly for RBDs
from the following other sarbecovirus strains: RaTG13-CoV (GenBank QHR63300; S protein
residues 319-541), SHC014-CoV (GenBank KC881005; residues 307-524), Rs4081-CoV (GenBank
KY417143; S protein residues 310-515), pangolin17-CoV (GenBank QIA48632; residues 317-539),
RmYN02-CoV (GSAID EPI_ISL_412977; residues 298-503), Rf1-CoV (GenBank DQ412042;
residues 310-515), W1V1-CoV (GenBank KF367457; residues 307-528), Yun11-CoV (GenBank
JX993988; residues 310-515), BM-4831-CoV (GenBank NC014470; residues 310-530), BtkY72CoV (GenBank KY352407; residues 309-530). Two versions of each RBD expression vector were
made: one including a C-terminal hexahistidine tag (G-HHHHHH) and SpyTag003
(RGVPHIVMVDAYKRYK) (43) (for coupling to SpyCatcher003-mi3) and one with only a
hexahistidine tag (for ELISAs). Biotinylated SARS-CoV-2 and Rs4081 RBDs were produced by cotransfection of Avi/His-tagged RBD expression plasmids with an expression plasmid encoding an

ER-directed BirA enzyme (kind gift of Michael Anaya, Caltech). RBD proteins were purified from
transiently-transfected Expi293F cell (Gibco) supernatants by nickel affinity and size-exclusion
chromatography (47). Peak fractions corresponding to RBDs were identified by SDS-PAGE and
then pooled and stored at 4˚C. A trimeric SARS-CoV-2 ectodomain with 6P stabilizing mutations
(53) was expressed and purified as described (24). Correct folding of the soluble SARS-CoV-2 S
trimer was verified by a 3.3 Å cryo-EM structure of a neutralizing antibody complexed with the
trimer preparation used for immunizations (24). To prepare fluorochrome-conjugated
streptavidin-tetramerized RBDs, biotinylated SARS-2 and Rs4081 RBDs were incubated with
streptavidin-APC (eBioscienceTM) and streptavidin-PE (ThermoFisher), respectively, overnight at
4oC at a 1:1 molar ratio of RBD to streptavidin subunit.

Preparation of human plasma IgGs. Plasma samples collected from COVID-19 convalescent and
healthy donors are described in (18). Human IgGs were isolated from heat-inactivated plasma
samples using 5-mL HiTrap MabSelect SuRe columns (GE Healthcare Life Sciences) as described
(24).

Preparation of RBD-mi3 nanoparticles. SpyCatcher003-mi3 particles were prepared by
purification from BL21 (DE3)-RIPL E coli (Agilent) transformed with a pET28a SpyCatcher003mi3 gene (including an N-terminal 6x-His tag) as described (54). Briefly, cell pellets from
transformed bacterial were lysed with a cell disruptor in the presence of 2.0 mM PMSF (Sigma).
Lysates were spun at 21,000xg for 30 min, filtered with a 0.2 µm filter, and mi3 particles were
isolated by Ni-NTA chromatography using a pre-packed HisTrapTM HP column (GE Healthcare).

Eluted particles were concentrated using an Amicon Ultra 15 mL 30K concentrator
(MilliporeSigma) and purified by SEC using a HiLoad® 16/600 Superdex® 200 (GE Healthcare)
column equilibrated with 25 mM Tris-HCl pH 8.0, 150 mM NaCl, 0.02% NaN3 (TBS). SpyCatchermi3 particles were stored at 4°C and used for conjugations for up to 1 month after filtering with
a 0.2 µm filter or spinning at 21,000xg for 10 min.

Purified SpyCatcher003-mi3 was incubated with a 3-fold molar excess (RBD to mi3 subunit) of
purified SpyTagged RBD (either a single RBD for making homotypic SARS-CoV-2 RBD particles or
an equimolar mixture of four or eight RBDs for making mosaic particles) overnight at room
temperature in TBS. Conjugated mi3 particle were separated from free RBDs by SEC on a
Superose 6 10/300 column (GE Healthcare) equilibrated with PBS (20 mM sodium phosphate
pH 7.5, 150 mM NaCl). Fractions corresponding to conjugated mi3 particles were collected and
analyzed by SDS-PAGE. Concentrations of conjugated mi3 particles were determined using a
Bio-Rad Protein Assay.

Immunizations. Animal procedures and experiments were performed according to protocols
approved by the IACUC. Experiments were done using 4-6 week old female Balb/c mice (Charles
River Laboratories), with 5 animals each for cohorts immunized with soluble SARS-CoV-2 S or
SpyCatcher003-mi3, and 10 animals each for remaining cohorts (Fig 3A). Immunizations were
carried out with intraperitoneal (ip) injections of either 5 µg of conjugated RBD (calculated as
the mass of the RBD, assuming 100% efficiency of conjugation to SpyCatcher003-mi3), 5 µg of
soluble SARS-CoV-2 S, or 6 µg of unconjugated SpyCatcher003-mi3, in 100 µL of 50% v/v

AddaVaxTM adjuvant (Invivogen). Animals were boosted 4 weeks after the prime with the same
quantity of antigen in adjuvant. Animals were bled every 2 weeks via tail veins, and then
euthanized 8 weeks after the prime (Day 56, 57) and bled through cardiac puncture. Blood
samples were allowed to clot at room temperature in MiniCollect® Serum and Plasma Tubes
(Greiner), and serum was harvested, preserved in liquid nitrogen, and stored at -80˚C until use.

Sera for ELISAs were collected at Day 14 (Prime) and Day 42 (Boost). Sera for neutralization
assays were collected at Day 28 (Prime) and Day 56 (Boost) (Fig. 3, fig. S3).

ELISAs. 10 µg/ml of a purified RBD (not SpyTagged) in 0.1 M NaHCO3 pH 9.8 was coated onto
Nunc® MaxiSorp™ 384-well plates (Sigma) and stored overnight at 4oC. Plates were washed
with Tris-buffered saline with 0.1% Tween 20 (TBS-T) after blocking with 3% bovine serum
albumin (BSA) in TBS-T for 1 hr at room temperature. Mouse serum was diluted 1:100 and then
serially diluted by 4-fold with TBS-T/3% BSA and added to plates for 3 hr at room temperature.
A 1:50,000 dilution of secondary HRP-conjugated goat anti-mouse IgG (Abcam) was added after
washing for 1 hr at room temperature. Plates were developed using SuperSignal™ ELISA Femto
Maximum Sensitivity Substrate (ThermoFisher) and read at 425 nm. Curves were plotted and
integrated to obtain the area under the curve (AUC) using Graphpad Prism 8.3 assuming a onesite binding model with a Hill coefficient (Fig. 3; fig. S3). We also calculated EC50s and endpoint
titers, which were determined using the dilution that was at or below the mean + 2 x the
standard deviation of the plate control (no primary serum added) for ELISA binding data (fig.
S3E,F). AUC calculations were used as they better capture changes in maximum binding (55).

Statistical significance of titer differences between groups were calculated using Tukey’s
multiple comparison test using Graphpad Prism 8.3.

Neutralization assays. SARS-CoV-2, SARS, WIV1, and SHC014 pseudoviruses based on HIV
lentiviral particles were prepared as described (18, 56) using genes encoding S protein
sequences lacking C-terminal residues in the cytoplasmic tail: 21 amino acid deletions for SARSCoV-2, WIV1, and SHC014 and a 19 amino acid deletion for SARS-CoV. IC50 values derived from
this pseudotyped neutralization assay method were shown to quantitatively correlate with
results from neutralization assays using authentic SARS-CoV-2 virus (44). For pseudovirus
neutralization assays, four-fold serially diluted sera from immunized mice were incubated with
a pseudotyped virus for 1 hour at 37˚C. After incubation with 293TACE2 target cells for 48 hours
at 37˚C, cells were washed twice with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) and lysed with
Luciferase Cell Culture Lysis 5x reagent (Promega). NanoLuc Luciferase activity in lysates was
measured using the Nano-Glo Luciferase Assay System (Promega). Relative luminescence units
(RLUs) were normalized to values derived from cells infected with pseudotyped virus in the
absence of serum. Half-maximal inhibitory dilutions (ID50 values) were determined using 4parameter nonlinear regression in AntibodyDatabase (57). Statistical significance of titer
differences between groups were calculated using Tukey’s multiple comparison test of ID50s
converted to log10 scale using Graphpad Prism 8.3.

Statistical Analysis. Comparisons between groups for ELISAs and neutralization assays were
calculated with one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) using Tukey’s post hoc test in Prism 9.0

(Graphpad). For correlation analysis between ELISA and neutralization titers, significance (p),
Spearman coefficients (rs), and linear plots were calculated using Prism 9.0 (Graphpad).
Differences were considered significant when p values were less than 0.05. Exact p values are in
relevant figure near each corresponding line, with asterisks denoting level of significance (*
denotes 0.01<p<0.05, ** denotes 0.001<p<0.01, *** denotes 0.0001<p<0.001, and ****
denotes p<0.0001).

Flow cytometry. B-cell analysis using flow cytometry was carried out as described (54). Briefly,
single-cell suspensions were prepared from mouse spleens using mechanical dissociation, and
red blood cells were removed using ACK lysing buffer (Gibco). The white blood cell preparation
was enriched for IgG+ B-cells using the negative selection protocol in a mouse memory B-cell
isolation kit (Miltenyi). The following commercial reagents were used to stain enriched
splenocytes: CD4-APC-eFluor 780 (clone: RM4-5), F4/80-APC-eFluor 780 (clone: BM8), CD8aAPC-eFluor 780 (clone: 53-6.7), Ly-6G-APC-eFluor 780 (clone: RB6-8C5), IgM- APC-eFluor 780
(clone: II/41) (Thermo Fisher Scientific), CD19-FITC (clone: 6D5) (Biolegend), IgG1 BV421 (clone:
X40) and IgG2 BV421 (clone: R19-15) (BD Bioscience). SARS-2 RBD-APC and Rs4081 RBD-PE for

700 (BD Bioscience). Stained cells were analyzed with a SY3200 Cell Sorter (Sony) configured to
detect 6 fluorochromes. 2,000,000 events were collected per sample and analyzed via FlowJo
software (TreeStar).

RmYN02 (GSAID EPI_ISL_412977), Rf1 (DQ412042), WIV1 (KF367457), SARS-CoV
(AAP13441.1), Yun11 (Cp/Yunnan2011, JX993988), BM-4831 (BM48-31/BGR/2008,
NC014470), and BtKY72 (KY352407). SARS-2 RBD residues that interact directly with ACE2
(58) are indicated by an asterisk. We note that antibody neutralization by direct binding of
ACE2-binding residues does not represent the only mechanism of neutralization for ACE2-tropic
viruses. This has been shown for monoclonal human antibodies derived from COVID-19
patients: some neutralizing antibodies do not directly interact with the ACE2-binding site on
RBD (for example, class 3 anti-SARS-CoV-2 neutralizing antibodies (24)). Red shading
indicates strains known to use ACE2 as a receptor.
