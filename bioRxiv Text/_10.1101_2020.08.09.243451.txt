Summary

20

The COVID-19 pandemic affects millions of people worldwide with a rising death toll.

21

The causative agent, severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2),

22

uses its nonstructural protein 1 (Nsp1) to redirect host translation machinery to the viral

23

RNA by binding to the ribosome and suppressing cellular, but not viral, protein synthesis

24

through yet unknown mechanisms. We show here that among all viral proteins, Nsp1

25

has the largest impact on host viability in the cells of human lung origin. Differential

26

expression analysis of mRNA-seq data revealed that Nsp1 broadly alters the

27

transcriptome in human cells. The changes include repression of major gene clusters in

28

ribosomal RNA processing, translation, mitochondria function, cell cycle and antigen

29

presentation; and induction of factors in transcriptional regulation. We further gained a

30

mechanistic understanding of the Nsp1 function by determining the cryo-EM structure of

31

the Nsp1-40S ribosomal subunit complex, which shows that Nsp1 inhibits translation by

32

plugging the mRNA entry channel of the 40S. We also determined the cryo-EM

33

structure of the 48S preinitiation complex (PIC) formed by Nsp1, 40S, and the cricket

34

paralysis virus (CrPV) internal ribosome entry site (IRES) RNA, which shows that this

35

48S PIC is nonfunctional due to the incorrect position of the 3’ region of the mRNA.

36

Results presented here elucidate the mechanism of host translation inhibition by SARS-

37

CoV-2, provide insight into viral protein synthesis, and furnish a comprehensive

38

understanding of the impacts from one of the most potent pathogenicity factors of

39

SARS-CoV-2.

Introduction

53

SARS-CoV-2, which causes the worldwide COVID-19 pandemic affecting millions of

54

people, belongs to the β-coronaviruses (Coronaviridae Study Group of the International

55

Committee on Taxonomy of, 2020). The virus contains a positive-sense and single-

56

stranded RNA that is composed of 5’-UTR, two large overlapping open reading frames

57

(ORF1a and ORF1b), structural and accessory protein genes, and 3’-poly-adenylated

58

tail (Lim et al., 2016). Upon entering the host cells, ORF1a and ORF1b are translated

59

and proteolytically processed by virus-encoded proteinases to produce functional

60

nonstructural proteins (Nsps) that play important roles in the viral infection and RNA

61

genome replication (Masters, 2006). Nsp1 is the first viral gene encoded by ORF1a

62

(Figure 1A) and is among the first proteins to be expressed after infection (Ziebuhr,

63

2005). It was shown that human SARS-CoV and group 2 bat coronavirus Nsp1 plays a

64

key role in suppressing the host gene expression (Kamitani et al., 2006; Narayanan et

65

al., 2008; Tohya et al., 2009). SARS-CoV Nsp1 has been shown to inhibit host gene

66

expression using a two-pronged strategy. Nsp1 targets the 40S ribosomal subunit to

67

stall the translation in multiple steps during initiation of translation and also induces an

68

endonucleolytic cleavage of host RNA to accelerate degradation (Kamitani et al., 2009;

69

Lokugamage et al., 2012). Nsp1 therefore has profound inhibitory effects on the host

70

protein production, including suppressing the innate immune system to facilitate the viral

71

replication (Narayanan et al., 2008) and potentially long-term cell viability consequences.

72

Intriguingly, viral mRNA overcomes this inhibition by a yet unknown mechanism, likely

73

mediated by the conserved 5’ UTR region of viral mRNA (Huang et al., 2011; Tanaka et

74

al., 2012). Taken together, Nsp1 acts as an important factor in viral lifecycle and

75

immune evasion, and may be an important virulence factor causing the myriad of long-

76

term illnesses of COVID-19 patients. It has been proposed as a target for live

77

attenuated vaccine development (Wathelet et al., 2007; Zust et al., 2007).

78

It is common for RNA viruses to target the initiation step of the host protein

79

translation system to allow expression of the viral proteins (Jan et al., 2016). Most

80

cellular mRNAs have a 5’ 7-methylguanosine (m7G) cap structure, which is essential for

81

mRNA recruitment to the 43S preinitiation complex (PIC) through interaction with the

82

translation initiation factor (eIF) eIF4F. 43S PIC is formed by the 40S ribosomal subunit,

83

the ternary complex eIF2-GTP-Met-tRNAiMet, and the multi-subunit initiation factor eIF3.

84

Binding of the 43S PIC to the m7G-cap results in the loading of the mRNA in the mRNA-

85

binding channel of the 40S to form the 48S PIC, and scanning of the mRNA from 5’ to 3’

86

direction under control of eIF1A and eIF1, until the initiation codon AUG is placed in the

87

P site of the 40S. Base pairing of Met-tRNAiMet with AUG results in conformational

88

changes in the 48S PIC for joining the large 60S ribosomal subunit to form the 80S

89

ribosome primed for protein synthesis (Hinnebusch, 2014, 2017b; Hinnebusch et al.,

90

2016). With the exception of the cricket paralysis virus (CrPV), which does not require

91

any host’s eIFs, all other viruses may target different eIFs to redirect the host

92

translational machinery on their own mRNA (Lozano and Martinez-Salas, 2015; Walsh

93

and Mohr, 2011).

94

We present here data demonstrating that among all viral proteins, Nsp1 causes

95

the most severe viability reduction in the cells of human lung origin. The introduction of

96

Nsp1 in human cells broadly alter the transcriptomes by repressing major gene clusters

97

responsible for protein synthesis, mitochondria function, cell cycle and antigen

presentation, while inducing a broad range of factors implicated in transcriptional

regulation. We further determined the cryo-EM structures of the Nsp1-40S complex with

100

or without the CrPV IRES RNA, which reveal the mechanism by which Nsp1 inhibits

protein synthesis and regulates viral protein production. These results significantly

advance our understanding of the Nsp1-induced suppression of host gene expression,

the potential mechanisms of SARS-CoV-2 translation initiation, and the broad impact of

Nsp1 as a comorbidity-inducing factor.

Results

107

SARS-CoV-2 open reading frame (ORF) screen identifies Nsp1 as a major viral

108

factor that affects cellular viability

109

A recent study has mapped the interactome of viral protein to host cellular components

110

in human HEK293 cells (Gordon et al., 2020), suggesting that these viral proteins might

111

have diverse ways of interacting or interfering with the fundamental cellular machineries

112

of the host cell. We generated a non-viral over-expression vector (pVPSB) for

113

introduction of viral proteins into mammalian cells and testing their effect on cells

114

(Figure 1B). We first confirmed that the positive control GFP can be introduced into

115

virtually all cells at 100% efficiency, using flow cytometry analysis. We cloned 28 viral

116

proteins (27 of the 29 viral proteins and Nsp5 C145A mutation) as open reading frames

117

(ORFs) into this vector and introduce them into human cells by transfection. We chose

118

to first test H1299, an immortalized cancer cell line of human lung origin. Although

119

H1299 cells are not primary lung epithelial cells, they have been utilized as a cellular

120

model to study SARS-CoV, MERS and SARS-CoV-2 (Hoffmann et al., 2020; Wong et al.,

121

2015).
We introduced all 28 cloned ORFs individually in parallel to conduct a mini-

122

123

screen of viral proteins’ effect on the viability of H1299 cells (Figures 1B and 1C). We

124

measured cell viability in two time points, 48 and 72 hours (h) post transfection.

125

Unexpectedly, we found Nsp1 as the sole “hit” with significant effect on cell viability at

126

both time points (Figure 1C). To validate the viability observations with increased

127

sensitivity, we generated an H1299 cell line with a constitutive firefly luciferase reporter

128

(H1299-PL), and confirmed that GFP can also be introduced into this cell line at near

129

100% efficiency (Figures S1A-C). We performed validation experiments, again with all

130

28 ORFs along with vector control, at 3 different time points (24, 48 and 72h). Across all

131

three time points, Nsp1-transfected H1299 cells have dramatically reduced luciferase

132

signal, an approximation of cell numbers (Figure 1D). We further repeat the same

133

experiments with the Vero E6 cell line, an African monkey (Cercopithecus Aethiops)

134

kidney derived cell line, commonly used in SARS-CoV-2 cellular studies (Blanco-Melo et

135

al., 2020; Hoffmann et al., 2020; Kim et al., 2020; Zhou et al., 2020). Consistently, we

136

observed a robust reduction of cellular viability in Vero E6 cells transfected with Nsp1

137

across all 3 time points (Figure S1D). These data revealed that among all SARS-CoV-2

138

proteins, Nsp1 has the largest detrimental effect on cell viability in H1299 and Vero E6

139

cells.

140

141

Nsp1 mutants abolish cellular viability phenotype

142

To ensure that the observed reduction of cell viability is indeed from expression of

143

functional Nsp1, we tested three different mutants of Nsp1, including a truncation

144

mutation after residues 12 (N terminal mutant) and two double mutations that have been

145

reported to ablate the activity of the highly homologous SARS-CoV Nsp1 (Wathelet et

146

al., 2007). The point mutations include Nsp1 mutant3 that has R124/K125 replaced with

147

S124/E125 (R124S/K125E) and Nsp1 mutant4 that has N128/ K129 replaced with

148

S128/E129 (N128S/K129E). We performed cellular viability assays with wild-type (WT)

149

Nsp1 along with all three of its mutants. In both H1299-PL and Vero E6-PL cells, we

150

again observed that introduction of Nsp1 into cells significantly reduced cell viability

151

along 24, 48, and 72 hours post electroporation (Figures 1E and S1E). Each of the

152

three mutants (truncation, R124S/K125E and N128S/K129E) reverted this phenotype to

153

the vector control level, fully abolishing the cytotoxic effect of Nsp1 (Figures 1E and

154

S1E). These results confirmed that functional Nsp1, but not its loss-of-function mutants,

155

induce reduction of cellular viability when overexpressed in the two mammalian cell

156

lines.

157

We further tested if Nsp1 expression also leads to cell death. We introduced

158

Nsp1 into H1299 cells, along with controls of empty vector and several other viral

159

proteins (Nsp2, Nsp12, Nsp13, Nsp14, ORF9b, and Spike), and measured cellular

160

apoptosis at 48h post electroporation by flow cytometry analysis of cleaved Caspase 3

161

staining. We found that introduction of Nsp1, but not other viral proteins, induced

162

apoptosis in H1299 cells (Figure S1F). To ensure the cellular apoptosis effect is indeed

163

from expression of functional Nsp1 protein, we performed the same apoptosis assay

164

with Nsp1 and the three non-functional mutants described above. Consistently, only

165

wild-type (WT) Nsp1 induced apoptosis in H1299-PL cells, whereas the three mutants

166

did not (Figure S1G). Replicates of this cleaved Caspase 3 flow assay with the

167

truncation mutation of Nsp1 confirmed that WT Nsp1, but not the loss-of-function

168

truncation mutant, induced apoptosis in H1299-PL cells (Figures 1F and 1G).

169

170

Transcriptome profiling of Nsp1-overexpressed cells

171

To unbiasedly investigate the global gene expression changes induced by Nsp1 or its

172

loss-of-function mutant form, we performed transcriptome profiling. We first confirmed

173

that Nsp1 is indeed over-expressed in host cells by qPCR using a custom-designed

174

NSP1-specific probe, at both 24 and 48 hours post electroporation (Figure 2A). We then

175

electroporated in quadruplicates for each of Nsp1, its truncation mutant, or vector

176

control plasmid into H1299-PL cells, and collected samples 24 hours post

177

electroporation for mRNA-seq. We collected 24h instead of 48h or 72h samples in order

178

to capture the earlier effect of Nsp1 on cellular transcriptome. We mapped the mRNA-

179

seq reads to the human transcriptome and quantified the expression levels of annotated

180

human transcripts and genes (Table S3). Principle component analysis showed clear

181

grouping and separation of WT Nsp1, mutant Nsp1, or vector control groups (Figure 2B),

182

confirming the overall quality of the Nsp1 mRNA-seq dataset.

183

Differential expression analysis revealed broad and potent gene expression

184

program changes induced by Nsp1 (Figure 2C; Table S3 and S4), with 5,394 genes

185

significantly downregulated and 3,868 genes significantly upregulated (FDR adjusted q

186

value < 0.01). To examine the highly differentially expressed genes, we used a highly

187

stringent criteria (FDR adjusted q value < 1e-30), and identified 1,245 highly significantly

188

downregulated genes (top NSP1 repressed genes) and 464 highly significantly

189

upregulated genes (top Nsp1 induced genes) (Figure 2C; Table S3 and S4). In sharp

190

contrast, Nsp1 truncation mutant and the vector control showed no differential

191

expression in the transcriptome, even when using the least stringent criteria (FDR

192

adjusted q value < 0.05) (Figures S2A-B; Table S3 and S4). These data revealed that

193

Nsp1 alone can cause major alterations broadly in the transcriptome shortly (24h) after

194

its introduction into host cells, consistent with its cell viability phenotype (Figure 1).

195

196

Enriched pathway analysis on differentially expressed gene sets revealed strong

197

signatures of cellular transcriptome alterations by Nsp1

198

We globally examined the highly differentially expressed genes as a result of Nsp1

199

expression. To understand what these genes represent as a group, we performed

200

DAVID clustering and biological processes (BP) analysis on the 1,245 top Nsp1-

201

repressed genes and the 464 top Nsp1-induced genes, respectively (Figure 2D; Table

202

S4). Enriched pathways in the top Nsp1-repressed genes showed that the most

203

significant gene ontology groups include functional annotation clusters of ribosomal

204

proteins and translation related processes, such as terms of ribonucleoprotein (RNP)

205

(Hypergeometric test, FDR-adjusted q = 6.30e-57), ribosomal RNA processing (q =

206

2.03e-28), and translation (q = 3.93e-28). Highly enriched Nsp1-repressed genes also

207

include the clusters of mitochondria function and metabolism (most terms with q < 1e-15)

208

and cell cycle and cell division (most terms with q < 1e-10), consistent with the reduced

209

cell viability phenotype. Other intriguing enriched Nsp1-repressed pathways include

210

ubiquitin/proteasome pathways and antigen-presentation activities, as well as mRNA

211

processing. We further performed gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA) that takes into

212

consideration both gene set and ranks of enrichment, and the results largely validated

10

213

the DAVID findings, with highly similar strongly enriched pathways (Figures 3A and

214

S2C). Analysis of highly differentially expressed genes between Nsp1 vs. Nsp1 mutant

215

showed results virtually identical to those of Nsp1 vs. vector (Figures S2A-B, Table S4).

216

We then examined the expression levels of the highly differentially expressed

217

genes in the context of enriched pathways in Nsp1, mutant Nsp1, or vector control

218

plasmid in H1299-PL cells. As shown in the heatmaps (Figure 3B), over 70 genes

219

involved in translation are strongly repressed upon introduction of Nsp1, including the

220

RPS, RPL, MRPS, MRPL family members, along with other translational regulators

221

such as AKT1. The repression effect on these genes is completely absent in the Nsp1

222

mutant group (Figure 3B). The strong repression effect also hit multiple members of the

223

gene families involved in mitochondria function, such as the COX, NUDFA, NUDFB and

224

NUDFS families (Figure 3C). Consistent with the cellular phenotypes, Nsp1 also

225

repressed a large number of mitotic cell cycle genes, including members in the CDK,

226

CDC and CCNB families, components of the centrosome, the anaphase promoting

227

complex and various kinases (Figure 3D). While part of the signal may be driven by

228

ribosomal and/or proteosomal genes, multiple genes involved in the mRNA processing

229

and/or nonsense-mediated decay nevertheless are significantly repressed by

230

Nsp1(Figures S2D-E). Interestingly, DAVID BP enrichment analysis of Nsp1-repressed

231

genes also scored the antigen presentation pathway, mostly proteasome components

232

along with several MHC-I component members (Figure 3E). Concordantly, Nsp1-

233

repressed genes are also enriched in the ubiquitination and proteasome degradation

234

pathways (Figure S2F).

235

On the other hand, genes highly induced by Nsp1 hit a broad range of factors

236

implicated in transcriptional regulation, such as unfolded protein response regulators

237

(ATF4, XBP1), FOX family transcription factors (TFs) (FOXK2, FOXE1, FOXO1,

238

FOXO3), Zinc finger protein genes (ZFN217, ZFN567), KLF family members (KLF2,

239

KLF10), SOX family members (SOX2, SOX4), Homeobox genes (HOXD9, HOXC8,

240

HOXD13), GATA TFs (GATAD2B, GATA6), dead-box protein genes (DDX5, DHX36),

241

cell fate regulators (RUNX2, CREBRF, LIF, JUNB, ELK1, JAG1, SMAD7, BCL3,

242

EOMES); along with certain epigenetic regulators of gene expression such as the

243

SWI/SNF family members ARID1A, ARID1B, ARID3B, and ARID5B (Figure 3F).

244

Interestingly, highly upregulated genes are also slightly enriched in the MAPK/ERK

245

pathway, where Nsp1 expression induces multiple DUSP family members (Figure 3G).

246

The upregulated genes also include several KLF family members related to the process

247

of cellular response to peptide (Figure S2G). Again, the induction effect on these genes

248

is completely abolished in the Nsp1 mutant group (Figures 3F and 3G). These data

249

together showed that Nsp1 expression broadly and significantly altered multiple gene

250

expression programs in the host H1299-PL cells.

251

252

Cryo-EM structure reveals Nsp1 is poised to block host mRNA translation.

253

To elucidate the mechanism of translation inhibition by Nsp1, we determined the cryo-

254

EM structure of rabbit 40S ribosomal subunit complex with Nsp1 at 2.7 Å resolution

255

(Table 1, Figures S3 and S4). The quality of the cryo-EM map allowed us to

256

unambiguously identify Nsp1 that binds to the head and the body domains of the 40S

257

around the entry to the mRNA channel (Figure 4). The density observed in the mRNA

258

entry channel enabled us to build an atomic model for the C-terminal domain of Nsp1

12

259

(C-Nsp1, amino acids (aa) 145-180) (Figure 4A). C-Nsp1 comprises two α-helices (α1,

260

aa 154-160; α2, aa 166-179) and two short loops (aa 145-153 and 161-165), which

261

blocks the mRNA entry channel (Figure 4B). Besides the α-helices in the mRNA

262

channel, extra globular density between the ribosomal protein uS3 and rRNA helix h16

263

is observed at a lower contour level, whose dimensions roughly matched the N-terminal

264

domain of Nsp1 (aa: 13-127, N-Nsp1, PDB:2HSX) (Almeida et al., 2007) (Figure 4C).

265

However, N-Nsp1 does not appear to be stably bound to the 40S and the low local

266

resolution of the cryo-EM map in this region did not allow for an atomic model for the N-

267

Nsp1.

268

C-Nsp1 bridges the head and body domains of the 40S ribosomal subunit

269

through extensive electrostatic and hydrophobic interactions with the ribosomal proteins

270

uS3 of the head, uS5 and eS30 and helix h18 of the 18S rRNA in the body (Figure 5A).

271

The buried surface area of interaction between C-Nsp1 and the 40S ribosomal subunit

272

is ~1,420 Å2. The negatively charged residues D152, E155 and E159 of C-Nsp1 interact

273

with the positively charged residues R117, R116, R143 and K148 of uS3, respectively

274

(Figure 5B). In addition, the positively charged surface of C-Nsp1 binds to the negatively

275

charged rRNA backbone of h18 (Figure 5C). K164 of Nsp1 inserts into the negatively

276

charged pocket formed by the backbone of G625 and U630 of the rRNA h18. H165 of

277

Nsp1 stacks with the base of U607 of h18, and R171 and R175 of C-Nsp1 interact with

278

the negatively charged patch formed by G601, A604, G606 and U607 of h18 (Figure

279

5C). Besides electrostatic contacts, a large hydrophobic patch of C-Nsp1, which is

280

formed by F157, W161, L173 and L177, interacts with a complimentary hydrophobic

281

patch on uS5 formed by V106, I109, P111, T122, F124, V147 and I151 (Figure 5D).

282

Intriguingly, K164 and H165 of Nsp1, which have been shown to play an important role

283

in host translation inhibition, are conserved only in the betacoronaviruses (beta-CoVs)

284

(Figure 5E). In addition, the other Nsp1 residues interacting with the h18 of rRNA are

285

also conserved only among the beta-CoVs (Figure 5E). This sequence conservation

286

indicates that the hydrophobic interactions between C-Nsp1 and uS5 are likely universal

287

in both alpha- and beta-CoVs, while the electrostatic interactions between C-Nsp1 and

288

the h18 of the 18S rRNA are conserved only in the beta-CoVs.

289

The extensive interactions result in C-Nsp1 plugging the mRNA entry channel,

290

which prevents the loading and accommodation of the mRNA (Figure 4B), providing a

291

structural basis for the inhibition of host protein synthesis by Nsp1 of SARS-CoV-2 and

292

SARS-CoV reported previously (Kamitani et al., 2009; Kamitani et al., 2006). Because

293

Nsp1 molecules of both viruses share 84% amino acid sequence identity, they likely act

294

by the same mechanism (Figures 5A and 5E). It was shown that K164 and H165 of

295

SARS-CoV Nsp1 KH motif are essential for the suppression of host protein synthesis

296

(Kamitani et al., 2009). In our structure the motif provides critical interactions with helix

297

h18, anchoring Nsp1 to the 18S rRNA (Figure 5C). These interactions constitute ~15%

298

of the overall C-Nsp1-40S ribosome interacting surface, which explains the detrimental

299

effect of K164A and H165A mutations on inhibition of host protein synthesis.

300

301

Nsp1 locks the 40S in a conformation incompatible with mRNA loading and

302

disrupts initiation factor binding

303

The ribosomal protein uS3 is conserved in all kingdoms. Together with h16, h18 and

304

h34 of 18S rRNA it constitutes the mRNA-binding channel and the mRNA entry site

305

(Graifer et al., 2014; Hinnebusch, 2017a). It has been shown that uS3 interacts with the

306

mRNA and regulates scanning-independent translation on a specific set of mRNAs

307

(Haimov et al., 2017; Sharifulin et al., 2015). Interestingly, conserved residues R116 and

308

R117 of uS3, which are crucial for stabilizing mRNA in the entry channel and

309

maintaining 48S PIC in the closed conformation, are interacting with D152, E155 of

310

Nsp1 in our structure (Dong et al., 2017; Hinnebusch, 2017a) (Figure 5B). Moreover, the

311

conformation of the 40S ribosomal subunit in Nsp1-40S complex is similar to that of

312

‘closed state’ of 48S PIC with initiator tRNA locked in the P site and the latch closed

313

(Lomakin and Steitz, 2013), which is incapable of mRNA loading. The distance between

314

G610 (h18) and GLN179 (CA, uS3) is shortened from 19.4 Å in the ‘open state’ 48S PIC

315

(PDB:3JAQ) to 15.8 Å in Nsp1-40S ribosomal complex, which is similar to the distance

316

of 15.0 Å in the closed state 48S PIC (PDB:4KZZ) (Figure 5F). This shows that Nsp1

317

not only plugs the mRNA entry channel, but also keeps the 40S subunit in a

318

conformation that is incompatible with mRNA loading.

319

The known structure of the N-terminal domain of SARS-CoV (N-Nsp1) (Almeida

320

et al., 2007) (PDB ID: 2HSX) can be docked into the extra globular density between uS3

321

and rRNA helix h16 in the cryo-EM map (Figure 6A). This potential interaction between

322

N-Nsp1 and uS3 covers most of the uS3 surface on the solvent side, including the

323

GEKG loop of uS3 (aa: 60-63) that corresponds to the consensus GXXG loop

324

conserved in the KH domains of various RNA-binding proteins (Babaylova et al., 2019b;

325

Graifer et al., 2014). Mutation of the GEKG loop to alanines does not abrogate the

326

ability of the 40S to bind mRNA and form 48S preinitiation complex (PIC). Instead, it

327

results in the formation of aberrant 48S PIC that cannot join the 60S ribosomal subunit

15

328

and assemble the 80S initiation complex (Graifer et al., 2014). Peculiarly, binding of

329

SARS-CoV Nsp1 to the ribosome led to the same effect (Kamitani et al., 2009). We

330

hypothesize that Nsp1 may prevent the formation of physiological conformation of the

331

48S PIC induced by uS3 interaction with translation initiation factors, such as the j

332

subunit (eIF3j) of the multi-subunit initiation factor eIF3 (Babaylova et al., 2019b; Cate,

333

2017; Sharifulin et al., 2016). The eIF3 complex plays a central role in the formation of

334

the translation initiation complex (Cate, 2017; Hinnebusch, 2014). eIF3j alone binds to

335

the 40S ribosomal subunit and stabilizes the interaction with eIF3 complex (Fraser et al.,

336

2004b; Sokabe and Fraser, 2014). The binding site of eIF3j to 40S subunit is not

337

precisely determined. Cryo-EM and biochemical studies mapped it onto the mRNA

338

binding channel of the 40S, extending from the decoding center toward the mRNA entry

339

region, including the GEKG loop of uS3 (Aylett et al., 2015; Fraser et al., 2007; Hershey,

340

2015) (Figure 6B).

341

We tested if Nsp1 can compete with eIF3j for the binding to the 40S ribosomal

342

subunit. The result showed that Nsp1 indeed significantly reduces the binding between

343

eIF3j and the 40S (Figure 6C). The binding competition of eIF3j and Nsp1 to the 40S

344

was tested at different concentrations. There is little eIF3j binding to the 40S when the

345

concentration of eIF3j is equal or lower than that of Nsp1, and residual eIF3j binding

346

was observed only when its concentration is higher than that of Nsp1 (Figures 6C and

347

S5). By contrast, the binding of Nsp1 to the 40S is not affected even when eIF3j is in

348

excess. These results indicate that Nsp1 disrupts the binding of eIF3j to the 40S,

349

potentially by shielding the access to uS3 and the mRNA binding channel and/or by

350

making the conformation of the 40S unfavorable for eIF3j interaction.

351

352

Nsp1 prevents physiological conformation of the 48S PIC

353

It was shown previously that binding of SARS-CoV Nsp1 to the 40S ribosomal subunit

354

does not inhibit 48S PIC formation, but it suppresses 60S subunit joining (Kamitani et al.,

355

2009). To understand the effect of Nsp1 of SARS-CoV-2 on 48S PIC, we determined a

356

3.3 Å resolution cryo-EM structure of Nsp1 bound to the 48S PIC assembled with the

357

cricket paralysis virus (CrPV) internal ribosome entry site (IRES) (Figures 6D, S6, and

358

S7). CrPV IRES has become an important model for studies of the eukaryotic ribosome

359

during initiation, as it is able to directly recruit and assemble with 40S or 80S ribosome

360

without requiring any eIFs (Martinez-Salas et al., 2018). It was shown that SARS-CoV

361

Nsp1 inhibits translation of the CrPV IRES RNA (Kamitani et al., 2009). We first

362

examined whether Nsp1 affects binding of the IRES RNA to the 40S ribosomal subunit.

363

The result shows that Nsp1 and CrPV IRES can bind 40S ribosomal subunit

364

simultaneously (Figure S6). Consistently, both C-Nsp1 and the CrPV IRES can be seen

365

in the cryo-EM map (Figure 6D), where the Nsp1 C-terminal domain is inserted in the

366

RNA entry channel in the same way as in the Nsp1-40S complex without the IRES RNA

367

(Figures 4A and 4B). The local environment of C-Nsp1 in the ribosome RNA entry

368

channel with or without the IRES RNA is quite similar. No conformational changes were

369

observed for C-Nsp1, protein uS5 and rRNA h18, however, the head of the 40S subunit

370

is moved by about 2.8 Å (Figure 6D) (discussed more below).

371

We fitted the high resolution structure of the CrPV IRES from the yeast 40S-CrPV

372

IRES complex(Murray et al., 2016) (PDB: 5IT9) into our cryo-EM map. Importantly, the

373

pseudoknot I (PKI) domain of the CrPV IRES, which is a structural mimic of the

374

canonical tRNA-mRNA interaction, is not seen in the cryo-EM map, suggesting that it is

375

dislodged from the 40S in the presence of Nsp1 (Figure 6E). Consistently, there would

376

be a clash between Nsp1 C-terminal domain and the 3’ region of the IRES RNA in the

377

previously observed conformation bound to the 40S (Murray et al., 2016) (Figure 6E).

378

The conformation of the 40S head in the Nsp1-40S-CrPV IRES complex is different

379

from that in the Nsp1-40S complex (Figure 6F). The head in the Nsp1-40S-CrPV IRES

380

complex is in somewhat intermediate conformation compared to the Nsp1-40S and the

381

40S-CrPV IRES complexes (Figure 6F). This suggests that the Nsp1-40S interactions

382

resist the conformational changes induced by the IRES for translation initiation.

383

Conformational changes of the head domain of the 40S subunit play important role in

384

the mRNA loading and recruitment of the 60S subunit to form the 80S ribosome. Nsp1

385

limits the rotation of the head, which may have profound consequences interfering with

386

the joining of the 60S subunit and the formation of the 80S initiation complex.

Discussion

389

SARS-CoV-2 infection causes a series of damages to the human body, often leading to

390

long-term illnesses (Grasselli et al., 2020). However, the cellular phenotypes and the

391

relative contributions of individual viral proteins are not clearly understood. While viral

392

infection is a complex process involving multiple components, certain viral proteins are

393

often in high abundance in cells during active viral replication (Astuti and Ysrafil, 2020;

394

Yoshimoto, 2020). Therefore, understanding the effects of each individual viral protein

395

on the cells provides important insights on the cellular impacts of viral infection. Using a

396

reductionist approach, we tested the gross cellular effect of expressing all the SARS-

18

397

CoV-2 proteins individually. Among all 27 viral proteins, Nsp1 showed the strongest

398

deleterious effect on cell viability in H1299 cells of human lung epithelial origin. This is in

399

concordance with previous observations from related coronaviruses, such as mouse

400

hepatitis virus (MHV) Nsp1 being a major pathogenicity factor strongly reducing cellular

401

gene expression (Zust et al., 2007), and SARS-CoV Nsp1 inhibiting interferon (IFN)-

402

dependent signaling and having significant effects on cell cycle (Wathelet et al., 2007). A

403

recent study shows that SARS-CoV-2 Nsp1 shuts down mRNA translation in cells and

404

suppresses innate immunity genes such as IFNb and IL-8, although these experiments

405

were conducted in HEK293T cells of kidney origin, and only a small number of host

406

genes were tested (Thoms et al., 2020). As an unbiased interrogation of global cellular

407

pathways affected by Nsp1, our transcriptome profiling data and gene set enrichment

408

analysis revealed strong signatures of transcriptomic changes in broad ranges of host

409

genes with several major clusters, providing a comprehensive understanding of the

410

impacts of one of the most potent pathogenicity protein factors of SARS-CoV-2 in

411

human cells of lung origin.

412

Our structure of the SARS-CoV-2 Nsp1 protein bound to the 40S ribosomal

413

subunit establishes a mechanistic basis of the cellular effects of Nsp1, revealing a

414

multifaceted mechanism of inhibition of the host protein synthesis at the initiation stage

415

by the virus. Nsp1 plugs the mRNA channel entry from the position +10 and up, which

416

physically blocks access to the channel by any mRNA (Figure 4B). This is consistent

417

with the result obtained from similar structural studies (Thoms et al., 2020). Moreover,

418

Nsp1 interacts with the ribosomal protein uS3 of the head domain and uS5 of the body

419

domain of the 40S subunit as well as with the helix h18 of the 18S rRNA, which locks

19

420

the head domain of the 40S subunit in the closed position. This position is characterized

421

by the closed conformation of the “mRNA entry channel latch” that clams around

422

incoming mRNA (Hinnebusch, 2017b; Lomakin and Steitz, 2013; Passmore et al., 2007).

423

The latch is supposed to be closed during the scanning of the mRNA, keeping mRNA

424

locked in the binding cleft and increasing processivity of the scanning, whereas the

425

open conformation of the latch would facilitate the initial attachment of the 43S PIC to

426

the mRNA (Lomakin and Steitz, 2013). Therefore, when Nsp1 keeps the latch closed it

427

makes impossible for the host mRNA to be loaded. In addition, the N-terminal domain of

428

Nsp1 interacts with the KH-domain of uS3, specifically with its GEKG loop crucial for

429

translation initiation (Figures 6A and 6B) (Babaylova et al., 2019a). We showed that

430

Nsp1 competes with eIF3j for the binding to the 40S subunit (Figure 6C). This allows us

431

to propose that Nsp1 weakens the binding of the eIF3 to the 40S subunit by disrupting

432

uS3-eIF3j interaction. Moreover, accessibility to the GEKG loop of uS3 is required for

433

the functional 48S PIC formation (Babaylova et al., 2019a; Fraser et al., 2004a; Graifer

434

et al., 2014; Sokabe and Fraser, 2014).

435

Our results explain how Nsp1 inhibits protein synthesis; however, how SARS-

436

CoV-2 escapes this inhibition and initiate translation of its own RNA still remains

437

unanswered. The 5’-UTR of SARS-CoV-2 is essential for escaping Nsp1-mediated

438

suppression of translation (Tanaka et al., 2012). Interactions involving the viral 5’ UTR

439

presumably result in the “unplugging” of Nsp1 from the 40S ribosome during the

440

initiation of viral translation. In addition, the weakening of eIF3 binding to the 40S

441

subunit is beneficial for translation initiation of some viruses. The hepatitis C virus (HCV)

442

IRES displaces eIF3 from the interface of the 40S subunit to load its RNA in the mRNA

443

binding channel (Hashem et al., 2013; Niepmann and Gerresheim, 2020). HCV IRES

444

interacts with eIF3a, eIF3c and other core subunits of eIF3 to promote formation of the

445

viral 48S PIC (Cate, 2017). The eIF3d subunit of the eIF3 complex can be cross-linked

446

to the mRNA in the exit channel of the 48S PIC, it has its own cap-binding activity which

447

can replace canonical eIF4E dependent pathway and promote translation of selected

448

cellular mRNAs (Lee et al., 2016; Pisarev et al., 2008; Walker et al., 2020). Interestingly,

449

a recent genome-wide CRISPR screen revealed the eIF3a and eIF3d are essential for

450

SARS-CoV-2 infection (Wei et al., 2020). It is possible that SARS-CoV-2 may use an

451

“IRES-like” mechanism involving eIF3 recruitment by 5’ UTR to overcome Nsp1

452

inhibition. Binding of 5’ UTR may cause conformational change of the 40S head leading

453

to the latch opening, Nsp1 dissociation, viral RNA loading into mRNA binding channel

454

and formation of the functional 80S initiation complex primed for viral protein synthesis.

455

However, the detailed mechanisms of viral escape of Nsp1 inhibition must await for

456

future experimental studies.

SARS-CoV-2 plasmid cloning

742

The cDNA templates of SARS-CoV-2 ORF gene containing plasmids were provided by

743

Dr. Krogan as a gift (Gordon et al., 2020), where the ORFs were primarily cloned into

744

lentiviral expression vector. A non-viral expression vector, pVPSB empty, where ORFs

745

were driven by a constitutive EFS promoter and terminated by a short poly A, was

746

constructed by cloning gBlock fragments (IDT) into pcDNA3.1 vector (Addgene, #52535)

747

by the Gibson assembly (NEB). All ORFs gene encoding fragments were PCR amplified

748

from the lentiviral vectors with ORF-specific forward primers and common reverse

749

primer that containing overlaps that corresponded to flanking sequences of the and

750

KpnI and XhoI restriction sites in the pVPSB empty vector. The primer lists were

751

provided in Table S1. ORFs PCR amplified fragments were gel-purified and cloned into

752

restriction enzyme digested backbone by the Gibson assembly (NEB). A lentiviral vector

753

constitutively expressing a Firefly Luciferase and a puromycin mammalian selection

754

marker (Lenti-Fluc-Puro) was generated by standard molecular cloning. All plasmids

755

were sequenced and harvested by Maxiprep for following assay.

756

Nsp1 mutant ORF construction

757

Truncation mutant Nsp1 has triple stop codons introduced after residues 12 (N terminal

758

mutant). Nsp1 mutant3 has R124 and K125 replaced with S124 and E125

759

(R124S/K125E). Nsp1 mutant4 has N128 and K129 were converted to S128 and E129

760

(N128S/K129E). IDT gBlocks were ordered for truncated Nsp1 and different Nsp1

761

mutants with 19~23 bp overlaps that corresponded to flanking sequences of the and

762

AgeI and BstXI restriction sites in the pVPSBA01-Nsp1 plasmid. pVPSBA01-Nsp1

Generation of stable cell lines

766

Lentivirus was produced by transfection of co-transgene plasmid (Lenti-Fluc-Puro) and

767

packaging plasmids (psPAX2, pMD2.G) into HEK293FT cells, followed by supernatant

768

harvesting, filtering and concentration with Amicon filters (Sigma). H1299 and Vero E6

769

cells were infected with Lenti-Fluc-Puro lentivirus. After 24 h of virus transduction, cells

770

were selected with 10 μg/mL puromycin, until all cells died in the control group. Luc

771

expressing H1299 and Vero E6 that with puromycin resistance cell lines were obtained

772

and named as H1299-PL and Vero E6-PL (Vero E6-PL for short) respectively.

773

Mammalian cell culture

774

H1299, H1299-PL, Vero E6, Vero E6-PL cell lines were cultured in Dulbecco s

Gene expression analysis by mRNA sequencing (mRNA-seq, RNA-seq)

812

For H1299-PL cells electroporated with Nsp1 or Nsp1 mutant, mRNA-seq libraries were

813

prepared following next-generation sequencing (NGS) protocols. Briefly, 1e6 H1299

814

cells were electroporated with 3 μg Nsp1, mutant Nsp1, and relative control plasmids.

815

Electroporation was done in with quadruplicates for each group. Cells were collected

816

24hr post electroporation. Total mRNA was extracted with RNasy Plus Mini Kit (Qiagen).

817

1μg total mRNA each sample was used for the RNA-seq library preparations. A

818

NEBNext® Ultra™ RNA Library Prep Kit for Illumina was employed to perform RNA-seq

819

library preparation and samples were multiplexed using barcoded primers provided by

820

860

Prism v.8. and/or RStudio.

861

Ribosome and CrPV IRES purification

862

40S ribosomal subunits were purified from the rabbit reticulocyte lysate (Green

863

Hectares, USA) as described previously (Lomakin and Steitz, 2013). The gene for wild-

864

type CrPV IRES (nucleotides 6028-6240) was chemically synthesized and cloned in the

865

pBluescript SK vector flanked at the 5’-end by a T7 promoter sequence and an EcoRI

866

cleavage site at the 3’-end. Standard in vitro transcription protocol was used for IRES

867

RNA synthesis and purification (MEGAscript™ T7 Transcription Kit, Ambion, USA).

868

Protein construction, expression and purification

869

Full-length SARS-CoV-2 Nsp1 was cloned into pMAT-9s vector and pET-Duet vector for

870

expression of MBP-tagged and 6×his tagged proteins, respectively. The Escherichia coli

871

BL21 (DE3) cells were used for protein expressions, which were induced by 0.5 mM

872

isopropyl β-D-1-thiogalactopyranoside (IPTG) at 16 °C for 16 hours in Terrific Broth.

873

Cells were harvested and lysed using a microfluidizer. The lysate was clarified by

874

centrifugation and then applied to a Ni-NTA (Qiagen) column. Anion exchange (HiTrap

875

Q HP, GE healthcare) chromatography was performed in a buffer of 50 mM Tris, pH 8.0

876

with a NaCl concentration gradient from 50 mM to 1M. Subsequent size exclusion

877

mM Tris, 150 mM NaCl, pH 8.0. Purity of the proteins was analyzed by SDS-PAGE after

879

each step. Full length eIF3j was expressed in Escherichia coli BL21 and purified with a

880

similar method.

881

Filter binding assays

882

Rabbit 40S ribosome and binding partners (proteins or CrPV IRES RNA) were

883

884

885

886

887

888

incubated together for 20 min at 37 °C in a total volume of 20 μl in 1× 48S buffer (20
mM HEPES(KOH) pH 7.5, 100 mM KCl, 2.5 mM MgAc, 1 mM DTT, 250 μM Spermidine
3HCl). Reaction mixtures were incubated for another 20 min at room temperature
before diluting to 100 μl with H100 buffer (10 mM HEPES(KOH) pH 7.0, 100 mM KCl, 5
mM MgAc, 2 mM DTT). Diluted reaction mixtures were filtered through 100 kDa filter
(Thermo Scientific) in 10,000g for 5 min. The flow through was collected. 200 μl H100

889

buffer was used for washing the unbound proteins or RNA for 4 times before analyzing

890

by SDS-PAGE or RNA gel.

891

892

893

894

The concentration for the 40S ribosome for the filter binding assay is 1.5 μM and
the Nsp1 concentration is 15 μM (ratio of 1:10). In the Nsp1 and eIF3j competition
assays, the concentrations of eIF3j are 7.5 μM, 15 μM and 30 μM corresponding to
ratios of 1:5, 1:10 and 1:20. The concentration of the CrPV IRES is 7.5 μM in the Nsp1-

895

IRES binding assay (ratio of 1:5).

896

Cryo-EM sample preparation, data collection and processing

897

40S ribosome and Nsp1, with or without the CrPV IRES RNA were mixed and incubated

898

at 37 °C for 20 mins to form a stable complex. The complex (4 μl) was applied to a C-

899

901

frozen in liquid ethane using FEI Vitrobot Mark IV (Thermo Fisher). The grids were

902

stored in liquid nitrogen before data collection.
Images were acquired on a FEI Titan Krios electron microscope (Thermo Fisher)

903

904

equipped with a post-GIF Gatan K3 direct detector in super-resolution mode, at a

905

nominal calibrated magnification of 81,000× with the physical pixel size corresponding

906

to 1.068Å. Automated data collection was performed using SerialEM (Mastronarde,

907

2005).

908

909

910

A total of 4,700 movie series were collected for the Nsp1-40S ribosome complex.
300 movies series were collected for the Nsp1-40S-CrPV IRES complex. For the Nsp140S ribosome complex, a defocus range of 0.5 μm to 2 μm was used. Data were

911

collected with a dose of 15.9 electrons per pixel per second. Images were recorded over

912

a 3.6s exposure with 0.1s for each frame to give a total dose of 50 electrons per Å2.

913

Similar conditions were used for the Nsp1-40S-CrPV IRES complex.

914

The same data processing procedures were carried out for both the two

915

complexes using standard pipelines in cryoSPARC(Punjani et al., 2017). The final

916

average resolution is 2.7 Å for the Nsp1-40S ribosome complex and 3.3 Å for the Nsp1-

917

40S-CrPV IRES complex (FSC=0.143). Local refinement was carried out for the head

918

domain of the 40S, which significantly increased the quality of the reconstruction for this

919

domain (Figure S4C).

920

Model building and refinement

921

The structure of the rabbit 40S ribosome was extracted from PDB: 4KZX (Lomakin and

922

Steitz, 2013) and 6SGC (Chandrasekaran et al., 2019). The model of Nsp1 C-terminal

923

domain was manually built in COOT (Emsley et al., 2010). The CrPV IRES structure
