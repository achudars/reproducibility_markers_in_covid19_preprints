ABSTRACT

SARS-CoV-2 is the coronavirus that originated in Wuhan in December 2019 and has spread
globally. The observation of a low prevalence of smokers among hospitalized COVID-19
patients has led to the development of a hypothesis that nicotine could have protective effects
by enhancing the cholinergic anti-inflammatory pathway. Based on clinical data and on
modelling and docking experiments we have previously presented the potential interaction
between SARS-CoV-2 Spike glycoprotein and nicotinic acetylcholine receptors (nAChRs),
due to a “toxin-like” epitope on the Spike Glycoprotein, with homology to a sequence of a
snake venom toxin. We here present that this epitope coincides with the well-described
cryptic epitope for the human antibody CR3022 and with the epitope for the recently
described COVA1-16 antibody. Both antibodies are recognizing neighboring epitopes, are
not interfering with the ACE2 protein and are not able to inhibit SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV2 infections. In this study we present the molecular complexes of both SARS-CoV and
SARS-CoV-2 Spike Glycoproteins, at their open or closed conformations, with the molecular
model of the human α7 nAChR. We found that the interface of all studied protein complexes
involves a large part of the “toxin-like” sequences of SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 Spike
glycoproteins and toxin binding site of human α7 nAChR.

1. INTRODUCTION

Severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) is a viral respiratory disease caused by the SARSassociated coronavirus (SARS-CoV). In February 2003, SARS was first reported in Asia. The
disease spread to countries in North America, South America, Europe, and Asia before the
SARS global outbreak of 2003 was contained. No known cases of SARS were reported
anywhere in the world after 2004 [1,2]. In April 2003, rumors spread that smoking protected
patients from developing SARS, which were rejected by the authorities [3]. Several studies
suggested that smokers were under-represented among hospitalized SARS patients but no
firm conclusions about the association between smoking and SARS-CoV infection were
drawn [4-7].

As the global pandemic of Corona Virus Disease 2019 (COVID-19), a disease caused by the
acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), is evolving, it is imperative to
understand the pathophysiology and the risk and potentially protective factors associated with
disease progression and severity in order to offer effective therapies. The association between
smoking and COVID-19 is controversial. Several meta-analyses have identified an unusually
low pooled prevalence of smoking compared to the population smoking rates [8, 9]. While
limitations exist in these analyses, similar observations of low smoking prevalence among
hospitalized COVID-19 patients have been observed in case series from many countries [10].
Cox et al. recently published a cohort study of 8.28 million participants, including 19,486
confirmed COVID-19 cases, and found that smoking was associated with lower odds for
COVID-19 diagnosis and ICU admission [11]. This apparently protective effect was stronger
for heavy and moderate smokers. Other studies have shown that, once hospitalized, smokers
are at higher risk for adverse outcomes [9,12]. We hypothesized for the first time in early
April 2020 that the Nicotinic Cholinergic System (NCS) could be involved in the
pathophysiology of severe COVID-19 and we have recently expanded on this hypothesis
[13,14].

The NCS is an important pathway which regulates the response to inflammation. Its effects
on macrophages and other immune cells are mainly regulated by the vagus nerve and by
alpha7 nicotinic acetylcholine receptors (nAChRs) [15]. This so-called “cholinergic antiinflammatory pathway” has been found beneficial in preventing inflammatory conditions
such as sepsis and Αcute Respiratory Distress Syndrome (ARDS) in animal models [16].
Dysregulation of the NCS could therefore be a possible cause for the uncontrolled
inflammatory response in COVID-19. It could also explain other clinical manifestations of
COVID-19 such as anosmia and thromboembolic complications [17]. We therefore
hypothesized that SARS-CoV-2 may interact directly with the NCS [18]. Through
computational modeling and docking experiments, we have identified a key interaction
between the SARS-CoV-2 Spike glycoprotein, mainly amino acids (aa) 381-386, and the
nAChR alpha subunit (mainly aa 189-192) extracellular domain (ECD), a region that forms
the core of the nAChRs "toxin-binding site". Similar to the interaction between the alpha
subunit of nAChR and α-bungarotoxin, this interaction reinforced the possibility of SARSCoV-2 interacting with nAChRs [18]. It is interesting that other research groups have
identified such an interaction through different epitopes of SARS-CoV-2 Spike glycoprotein
[19].

Yuan et al. recently presented the crystal structure of CR3022, a human antibody previously
isolated from a convalescent SARS patient, in complex with the receptor binding domain
(RBD) of the SARS-CoV-2 Spike (S) glycoprotein at 3.1Å resolution [20]. Huo et al. also
reported that CR3022 binds to the RBD, and presented the crystal structure of the Fab/RBD
complex at 2.4Å resolution [21]. The antibody's neutralizing potential is established for
SARS-CoV but not for SARS-CoV-2, although it may exhibit some in vivo protection against
the latter. Both groups recognized that the highly conserved and cryptic epitope for CR3022
is inaccessible in the prefusion Spike glycoprotein. Neither group could explain the exact
function of this epitope, but both proposed that this cryptic epitope could be therapeutically

useful, possibly in synergy with an antibody that blocks ACE2 attachment. The aa that form
this epitope are highly conserved in SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2. Of the 28 epitope
residues (defined as residues buried by CR3022), 24 are preserved between SARS-CoV and
SARS-CoV-2. This explains the CR3022 cross-reactivity to SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2
RBDs. Nevertheless, despite having high epitope residue conservation, CR3022 Fab binds to
SARS-CoV RBD with much greater affinity than to SARS-CoV-2 RBD. CR3022's epitope
does not overlap with the ACE2-binding site. Structural alignment of the CR3022-SARSCoV-2 RBD complex with the ACE2-SARS-CoV-2 RBD complex further implies that
CR3022 binding does not interfere with ACE2 [20]. This suggests that the neutralization
mechanism of CR3022 for SARS-CoV is not based on direct blocking of receptor binding,
which is consistent with the finding that CR3022 does not compete with ACE2 for binding to
the RBD [22]. Liu et al. recently presented a SARS-CoV-2 specific antibody, called COVA116, isolated from a convalescent COVID-19 patient, which binds to the same epitope [23].
The affinity for SARS-CoV-2 Spike glycoprotein is higher, compared to the affinity for
SARS-CoV Spike glycoprotein, as expected.
In this study, we examined the potential interaction between α7 nAChRs and SARS-CoV and
SARS-CoV-2 Spike glycoproteins RBDs. For SARS-CoV-2 our previous study identified
such an interaction located at aa 375-390, a region that is homologous to a sequence of the
NL1 homologous neurotoxin which is a well-established NCS inhibitor [24,25]. Interestingly
this epitope is part of the cryptic epitope mentioned above for the human antibody CR3022
and COVA1-16 [20,21,23]. Having previously presented the 3D structural location of this
“toxin-like” sequence on the Spike glycoprotein and the superposition of the modelled
structure of the Neurotoxin homolog NL1 and the SARS-CoV-2 Spike glycoprotein [18], we
are extending our previously published molecular modeling and docking experiments by
presenting the complexes of both SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 S glycoproteins with the

ECD of the model of human α7 nAChR pentamer, in their "open" and "closed"
conformations, ideally adopted by Spike glycoproteins.

2. METHODS
2.1. Sequence retrieval and alignment

We compared aa sequences between SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 Spike glycoproteins and
snake venom neurotoxins. Sequence retrieval of the protein sequences of both virus-related
Spike proteins and “three finger” neurotoxins from various species was performed using the
National Center for Biotechnology Information (NCBI, Bethesda, MD, USA) databases.
BLAST searches were performed using Mega BLAST [26] with the UNIPROT protein
database [27] and by using BLASTP (protein–protein BLAST) with default parameters.
Multiple sequence alignments were performed using ClustalOmega program (Clustal-O) [28].

2.2. Structure retrieval

The 3D structures of the SARS-CoV-2 Spike glycoprotein (S1) in complex with the human
Angiotensin Converting Enzyme 2 (hACE2) (PDB id: 6LZG), the hACE2 (1R41, 1R42) the
cryo-EM determined complex of spike protein S-ACE2-B0AT1 neutral amino acid
transporter (PDB id: 6M18), the structure of a neutralizing to SARS-CoV mAb that also
cross-reacts with the S protein of SARS-CoV-2 when the latter is in complex with the ACE2
receptor (PDB id: 6NB7), the ECD of the nAChR α9 subunit in complex with α-bungarotoxin
(PDB id: 4UY2), the structure of SARS-CoV-2 RBD in complex with the human monoclonal
antibody CR3022 (PDB id:6W41) and the structure of the ligand binding domain (LBD) of a
chimera pentameric α7 nAChR (PDB id: 3SQ9) were downloaded from the Protein Data
Bank (PDB).

2.3. Molecular modelling and docking experiments

The protein structure prediction of the ECD of human α7 nAChR was performed using
ROSETA software [29], applying automated multi-step and multi-template homology
modelling approach. The complexes between SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 Spike 1 (S1)
glycoprotein and ECD of the human pentameric α7 nAChR were modelled using
HADDOCK server [30]. The predicted interaction surfaces and the ambiguous interaction
restrains (AIRs) which were used to drive HADDOCK process were automatically generated
using WHISCY software. The input data for WHISCY prediction of the interaction surface
between ECD of human pentameric α7 nAChR and SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 S1
glycoproteins were the conserved residues that were experimentally identified to be involved
in the interaction between α7 nAChR chimera and α-bungarotoxin. The binding affinity of
biomolecular complexes were predicted using PRODIGY software [31]. All the protein
structures are visualized using UCSF chimera software [32].

3. RESULTS
3.1. Sequence alignment

Figure 1A presents the sequence alignment of SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 S1
glycoproteins (A7J8L4, P0DTC2) with Neurotoxin homolog NL1 (Q9DEQ3). We found a
double "recombination" within the same S-protein sequence (aa 375-390), which is
homologous in the Neurotoxin homolog NL1 sequence, part of the "three-finger" interacting
motif of the toxins. This peptide fragment (aa 375-390) is part of the RBD (aa 319-541) of
the SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 Receptor Binding Domain (RBD) (aa 306-527) Spike
glycoproteins (the domain through which the spike protein recognizes the ACE2 on the host’s
cell surface) neighboring to the ACE2 Receptor Binding Motif (aa 437-508). Quite
importantly, this peptide is the main part of the epitope for the CR3022 antibody, as
described before [20,21]. The main interacting amino acids between the RBD of SARS-CoV
and mAb CR3022, as described in the crystal structure of CR3022 and SARS-CoV-2 Spike

3.2. Molecular modelling of toxin-like fragment of SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 RBD

This “toxin-like” fragment on SARS-CoV (aa 362-377) and SARS-CoV-2 (aa 375-390)
RBD, containing an amphipathic sequence of alternating polar and hydrophobic amino acid
residues with selectively charged amino acids in a conserved order, lies on the spike protein
surface and is not buried in the domain core. The toxin-like sequence, in ball and stick
representation, and its location in the protein surface is illustrated in Figure 2. Neighboring
the ACE2 binding motif, this entity may interact with the human α7 nAChRs in a manner
similar to neurotoxins.

3.3. Interaction of SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 S1 with the ECD of human α7 nAChR
We have previously identified the interaction between the SARS-CoV-2 S1 glycoprotein (aa
381-386) and the α9 subunit of nAChR ECD (aa 189-192), a region that forms the core of the
nAChR "toxin-binding site". The interaction between the two proteins is caused by
complementarity of the hydrogen bonds and shape [18]. The interaction mode is very similar
to the interaction between α9 nAChR and both α-bungarotoxin and the homologous
neurotoxin NL1 (snake venom toxins are known to inhibit nAChRs). Similar interacting
surfaces were observed between the SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 S1 and the LBD of the
pentameric α7 nAChR chimera.
Herein, the HADDOCK models show that the interface of all studied protein complexes
involves the majority of the toxin like sequences within SARS-CoV S proteins and toxin
binding site of human α7 nAChR. The binding affinity (ΔG, expressed in kcal mol-1), the
dissociation constant (Kd at 25 , expressed in Molar), electrostatic energy (expressed in kcal

are presented in Table 1. The dissociation constant of all SARS-α7 nAChR complexes found
to be in the nM range, which is comparable with experimental supported Kds of well-known
enzymatic interacting partners that produce stable protein complexes (i.e., E2-E3 pairs in
ubiquitination pathway [33]).

Slightly different orientations of the protein interactions were observed between the open and
closed complexes of SARS-CoV-2 Spike with the LBD of α7 nicotinic receptor (Figure 5).
In both open and closed conformation, the orientation of the RBD of SARS CoV-2 when
interacting with the α7 subunit is more similar with the interaction of the closed, rather than
the open, conformation of the RBD of SARS CoV.

4. DISCUSSION

According to our hypothesis, SARS-CoV-2 Spike glycoprotein has a “toxin-like” sequence in
its RBD which could bind to the toxin-binding domain of the alpha subunit of the nAChRs.
This binding could produce a number of adverse effects by dysregulating the NCS, in which

α7 nAChRs are mainly involved. One of the effects could be the dysfunction of the
cholinergic anti-inflammatory pathway, resulting in cytokine storm and failure for the
immune response to return to homeostasis. Several clinical manifestations of COVID-19
could be explained by cholinergic dysfunction [34]. These findings, if proven in vivo, could
have important therapeutic implications.

Herein we extent our previous findings of an interaction between SARS-CoV-2 Spike
glycoprotein (aa 381-386) and the nAChR α9 subunit, by presenting the complexes of both
SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 Spike glycoproteins with the ECD of the model of the human

α7 nAChR pentamer, in their "open" and "closed" conformations.
Recently, Yan et al. characterized a conserved cryptic epitope on the Spike glycoprotein,
recognized by the human mAb CR3022, which does not appear to inhibit the binding to the
ACE2 protein [20]. Similarly, Liu et al. identified and characterized the COVA1-16 mAb,
which binds to SARS-CoV-2 Spike glycoprotein to a similar region [23]. Most RNA viruses
through antigenic mutation can avoid adaptive immunity of the host [35]. This is achieved
due to the error-prone nature of RNA polymerases which induces sequence variation in each
virus cycle replication, allowing frequent generation of mutant species [36]. Therefore,
naturally occurring “epitopes” in viral antigens, usually targeted by neutralizing antibodies,
are intrinsically subjected to antigenic variations. However, some proteins sites on the viral
surface are less susceptible to mutation [37-39]. Such conserved regions are typically related
to functions that are necessary for viral infection, such as receptor binding or membrane
fusion, and are, therefore, less affected by antigenic variability [40].

Quite surprisingly, the cryptic epitope on the SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 Spike
glycoproteins is highly conserved and coincides with the toxin-like sequence interacting with
nAChR. According to this hypothesis, CR3022, mutants of CR3022 with higher affinity to
SARS-CoV-2 Spike glycoprotein and the COVA1-16 antibody can inhibit the interaction
between Spike Glycoproteins and nicotinic cholinergic system.

5. CONCLUSIONS

These in silico findings support our recently published hypothesis that SARS-CoV-2 could
interact with nAChRs causing dysregulation of the NCS and the cholinergic antiinflammatory pathway. Such interactions may lead to uncontrolled immune response and
cytokine storm, which is implicated in severe COVID-19 pathophysiology. Our efforts
towards elucidating the potential molecular interactions between SARS-CoV-2 S
glycoprotein and human nAChRs could provide a basis for accelerated vaccine,
immunotherapy and diagnostic strategies against SARS-CoV-2 and other associated
betacoronaviruses that could pose a major global human threat in the future.
