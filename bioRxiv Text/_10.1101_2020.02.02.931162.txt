Abstract

There is rising global concern for the recently emerged novel Coronavirus (2019-nCov). Full genomic
sequences have been released by the worldwide scientific community in the last few weeks in order to
understand the evolutionary origin and molecular characteristics of this virus. Taking advantage of all the
genomic information currently available, we constructed a phylogenetic tree including also
representatives of other coronaviridae, such as Bat coronavirus (BCoV) and SARS. We confirm high
sequence similarity (>99%) between all sequenced 2019-nCoVs genomes available, with the closest BCoV
sequence sharing 96.2% sequence identity, confirming the notion of a zoonotic origin of 2019-nCoV.
Despite the low heterogeneity of the 2019-nCoV genomes, we could identify at least two hyper-variable
genomic hotspots, one of which is responsible for a Serine/Leucine variation in the viral ORF8-encoded
protein. Finally, we perform a full proteomic comparison with other coronaviridae, identifying key
aminoacidic differences to be considered for antiviral strategies deriving from previous anti-coronavirus
approaches.

Introduction

(CoVs) are the largest known single stranded RNA viruses [1]. They have been categorized
in three groups, based on phylogenetic analyses and antigenic criteria [2], specifically: 1) alpha-CoVs,
responsible for gastrointestinal disorders in human, dogs, pigs and cats; 2) beta-CoVs, including the Bat
coronavirus (BCoV), the human Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) virus and the Middle Eastern
Respiratory Syndrome (MERS) virus; 3) gamma-CoVs, which infect avian species.

Very recently, a novel beta-CoVs Coronavirus (2019-nCoV) originating from the province of Wuhan, China,
has been causally linked to severe respiratory infections in humans. At the time of writing, 14,441 cases
of 2019-nCoV-related pneumonia cases have been reported in China, plus 118 cases from 23 other
countries. There are currently 315 deaths linked to this pathogen (source: World Health Organization
report, 02-Feb-2020). Phylogenetic relationships between Bat and Human coronaviridae have been
discovered for SARS [3] and more recently also for 2019-nCoV [4], suggesting events of inter-species
transmissions [5].

No vaccine for 2019-nCoV has been publicly released, but a World effort has arisen towards the
characterization of the molecular determinants and evolutionary features of this novel virus. An initial
comparison of 10 genomic sequences from 2019-nCoV specimens has reported a low heterogeneity of this
viruses with intersample sequence identity above 99.9% [6]. There are currently 54 2019-nCoV complete
genome sequences from the Global Initiative for Sharing all Influenza Data (Gisaid [7]) and from GenBank
[8], plus two partial sequences obtained by the Spallanzani hospital in Rome, Italy (also from Gisaid).

In this short report, we set out to characterize the heterogeneity of all 2019-nCoV genomes and
proteomes available at the moment of the study, comparing them to other representative coronaviridae,

specifically SARS, MERS and BCoV. We will generate phylogenetic trees of the 2019-nCoV cases and apply
entropy-based analyses of position-wise variance and a Categorical Principal Component analysis as an
alternative method to estimate the sequence distance between all analyzed viruses.

We collected 53 full genomic 2019-nCoV sequences from the Gisaid database (Supplementary Table S1),
plus the GenBank-deposited sequence from the Wuhan seafood market pneumonia virus isolate WuhanHu-1 (NC_045512.2) and two partial sequences from Italian isolates (EPI_ISL_406959 and
EPI_ISL_406960). To compare 2019-nCoVs with closely related viral species, we obtained six sequences
from distinct human SARS genomes from GenBank (the reference NC_004718.3, plus the genomes
AY274119.3, GU553363.1, DQ182595.1, AY297028.1 and AY515512.1). We also obtained six Bat
coronavirus genomic sequences (DQ022305.2, DQ648857.1, JX993987.1, KJ473816.1, MG772934.1,
EPI_ISL_402131). Finally, as more distantly related beta-CoVs we analyzed also MERS genomes from
GenBank entries JX869059.2 and KT368829.1.

Similarly to a previous report with 10 virus specimens [6], we detected a very high conservation between
the 56 analyzed 2019-nCoV genomes, with sequence identity above 99%. We found a bat CoV genome
(Gisaid EPI_ISL_402131) with 96.2% sequence identity (and query coverage above 99%) to the 2019nCoV reference sequence (NC_045512.2), while the previously reported closest bat CoV (bat-SL-CoVZC45)
has a sequence similarity of 88% [6]. The reference human SARS genome (NC_004718.3) appears more
distant from the reference 2019-nCoV, with sequence identity of 80.26% and query coverage of 98%.

23

We aligned all the 70 coronavirus sequences using MUSCLE [9] and inferred the evolutionary
relationships between these sequences with a Tamura-Nei Maximum Likelihood estimation [10] with 100
bootstraps for model robustness estimation.

The results are shown in Figure 1 as a phylogenetic tree representation. All the human 2019-nCoV appear
very similar to each other, despite the different locations of sampling. Bat coronaviridae appear to be the
closet homologs. Two specific specimens gathered in 2013 and 2015 in China from the bat species
Rhinolophus affinis and Rhinolophus sinicus appear to be located between the Bat coronavirus and the
human 2019-nCoV groups, supporting the notion of a zoonotic transfer from bats to humans [4]. Human
SARS sequences group with Bat coronavirus sequences more distantly related to 2019-nCoV genomes.
Finally, MERS genomes are the most genetically distinct amongst the other sequences.

A purely topological representation of a bootstrapped Maximum Likelihood tree (Supplementary Figure
S1) shows that 2019-nCoV sequences are highly similar to each other, with poor support to the existence
of distinct subgroups.

Global Genomic Variance

Given the high homogeneity between 2019-nCoV genomes, we developed a novel method to classify
genomic sequences, based on categorical Principal Component Analysis (CATPCA, [11]). Briefly, this
analysis finds the eigenvectors describing the highest variance within a categorical dataset, like ours. Our
dataset derived from the MUSCLE MSA of of 70 genomes and generated 32,206 positions: the categories in
each coordinate could be A (Adenine), C (Cytosine), G (Guanine), (Thymine, although being a ssRNA virus,

dataset, and accounting for only 9 positions, or 0.0004% of all the data).

Our analysis shows similar results to phylogenetic tree representations. In Figure 2 A, we show the catPCA
of the first components for all analyzed genomes. The MERS/nonMERS grouping accounts for the largest
variance, while SARS and SARS-like BCoVs cluster together). While 2019-nCoV constitute a tightly similar
cluster, the two bat virus sequences MG772934.1 and EPI_ISL_402131 appear to be linking the human
2019-nCoV to the bat coronaviridae.

A catPCA analysis on the sole 2019-nCoV sequences highlights some internal variability (Figure 2 B), with
two likely outliers identified in the genome EPI_ISL_406862 (collected in Germany) and EPI_ISL_406592
(collected in Shenzhen, China).

Genomic variance estimation within 2019-nCoV genomes

19
20
21

For each position of the multi-aligned 54 2019-nCoV, we calculated Shannon Entropy as a measure of the
position variability [13]. Apart from the 5’ and 3’ ends, likely non-protein coding and less homogeneous,
we identified two hotspots of hypervariability at positions 8789 and 28151 (Figure 3 B and C).

22
23
24
25

Position 8789 witnesses the presence of either T (U) or C, and it falls within the polyprotein gene. It
causes a synonymous variation in the nucleotide triplet encoding for Serine 2839 (aminoacid coordinates
based on the reference genome NC_045512.2), so it is likely not to introduce phenotypical differences
between the different strains.

26
27
28
29

On the other hand, position 28151 falls within ORF8 and is characterized by the presence of either a C or a
U. This causes a Ser/Leu change in aminoacid (aa) 84, which can affect the conformation of the peptide,
given that Serine is a polar aminoacid, and Leucine is nonpolar. Aa84 appears to be non-conserved also
across other coronaviridae (Figure 4 A, black arrow).

We analyzed the alternative isoforms of 2019 nCoV ORF8-aa84 alternative isoforms, dubbed ORF8-L
(Leucine) and ORF8-S (Serine). Unfortunately, no crystal structures of close homologs to the ORF8 protein
are available for a reliable homology modelling to measure the structural impact of this aminoacid
substitution. The closest 3D model to 2019-nCoV ORF8 available in Protein Data Bank [14] is a short 22
aminoacid stretch in the protein entry 6P65, with a non-significant E-value of 0.848. We therefore
employed de novo methods to infer structural features of ORF8. One important effect we could detect is a
significant effect of Serine in ORF8-S in inducing structural disorder in the protein C-terminal portion,
which is not predicted to be present in the ORF8-L (Figure 4 B), using the Russell/Linding algorithm [15].
Moreover, it did not escape our attention that the ORF8-S could theoretically generate a novel
phosphorylation target for the mammalian host Serine/Threonine kinases of the host organism. So, we
searched for ORF8 homologous substrates in the Mammalia NCBI nr protein database, but could not find
matches within E-value threshold of 1.

Although the variability within the 2019-nCoV genomes is very low, we set out to discover possible hot
spots of hypervariability within the viral population. We analyzed the ~30,000nt of multiple genome
alignments performed on the 54 full 2019-nCoV genomes. Our analysis shows that these viruses have
largely the same genomic arrangement as the SARS species [12]. A large gene encoding for a polyprotein
(ORF1ab) at the 5’ end of the genome is followed by 4 major structural protein-coding genes: S = Spike
protein, E = Envelope protein, M = Membrane protein and N = Nucleocapsid protein. There are also at
least 6 other accessory ORFs (Open Reading Frames) (Figure 3 A).

Our analysis shows a close homology for all proteins with Bat sequence MG772934.1 (>80%), and more
distant with the other Bat sequence and SARS reference. Query (2019-nCoV) coverage was always above
99.0%. Generally, we could observe a high conservation for structural proteins E, M and A across the betacoronavirus family, while accessory proteins (especially ORF8) seem to have much stricter evolutionary
constraints (Table 1).

Discussion

Our results highlight a high level of conservation within 2019-nCoV genomes sequenced so far, and a clear
origin from other beta-CoVs, specifically BCoVs, SARS and MERS. Our analysis confirms previous results
highlighting the Bat coronavirus as a likely evolutionary link between the SARS viruses and the current
epidemic 2019-nCoV [4]. We could confirm this result both with standard phylogenetic analysis and a
newly developed visualization method for genomic distances, based on CATPCA.

The similarity between 2019-nCoV and the closest Bat relative is very high: all proteins in the coronavirus
proteome (with the exception of ORF10) have identities of above 85%, with full conservation of the
genome length (~30kb). We could report also the specific aminoacids that changed between SARS and
nCoV, with potential implication in epitope definition and possible repurposing of anti-SARS drugs and
vaccines.

Our analysis found low variability (>99% sequence identity) within the 56 2019-nCoV genomes available
at the time of writing, with only two core positions of high variability, one a silent variant in the ORF1ab
locus, and the other as an aminoacid polymorphism in ORF8. The mutation in ORF8 resulting in one of its
two variants, ORF8-L and ORF8-S, is predicted to be affecting the structural disorder of the protein.
Specifically, the amino acidic region aa83-aa89 is more likely to be disordered in the ORF8-S isoform.

In conclusion, our analysis confirms low variability within the new epidemic virus 2019-nCoV sequenced
specimens, while highlighting at least two nucleotide positions of higher variability within protein coding
regions, and specific aminoacid divergences compared to BCoVs and SARS [4]. These findings shed a
cautiously optimistic light on the possibility of finding effective treatment for this novel coronavirus,
starting from already existing anti-beta-coronaviridae compounds [16], which will be dealing with a
relatively homogenous viral population.

Methods

All genomic sequences were collected On 02-Feb-2020 from GenBank [8] or Gisaid [7].

19

MSA was performed using MUSCLE v3.8.31 [9].

20

MSA visualization was generated via Jalview v 2.11.0 [17].

21
22
23

Phylogenetic model generation and tree visualization was done using MEGAX v 10.1.7 [18], using the
Maximum Likelihood method and Tamura-Nei model [10]. The tree structure was validated by running
the analysis on 100 bootstrapped input datasets [19].

24
25
26
27
28
29

Categorical Principal Component Analysis was performed on R version 3.6.1 using the package
FactoMineR [11]. Specifically, a MSA FASTA file from MUSCLE is loaded in R and converted into a
categorical matrix, with genomes as rows and nucleotide coordinates as columns. Factors are defined as A,
C, G, T, N or – (gap), as described in results. Then, the FactoMineR Multiple Correspondence Analysis
(MCA) algorithm is run with default parameters and custom R functions are used to plot the component
values for each genome.

30
31
32

Pairwise protein identity and coverage was calculated using BLAST protein v2.6.0 [20] with BLOSUM62
matrix and default parameters. Nucleotide sequence identity and coverage were calculated using BLAST
nucleotide v2.6.0 [20].

33
34

Prediction of structural protein disorder was performed using GLOBPLOT2, an implementation of the
Russell/Linding algorithm [15].
