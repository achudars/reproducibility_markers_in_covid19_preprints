Abstract
Beside socio-economic issues, coronavirus pandemic COVID-19, the infectious disease
caused by the newly discovered coronavirus SARS-CoV-2, has caused a deep impact in
the scientific community, that has considerably increased its effort to discover the
infection strategies of the new virus. Among the extensive and crucial research that has
been carried out in the last few months, the analysis of the virus-host relationship plays
an important role in drug discovery. Virus-host protein-protein interactions are the
active agents in virus replication, and the analysis of virus-host protein-protein
interaction networks is fundamental to the study of the virus-host relationship. We have
adapted and implemented a recent integer linear programming model for protein-protein
interaction network alignment to virus-host networks, and obtained a consensus
alignment of the SARS-CoV-1 and SARS-CoV-2 virus-host protein-protein interaction
networks. Despite the lack of shared human proteins in these virus-host networks and
the low number of preserved virus-host interactions, the consensus alignment revealed
aligned human proteins that share a function related to viral infection, as well as human
proteins of high functional similarity that interact with SARS-CoV-1 and SARS-CoV-2
proteins, whose alignment would preserve these virus-host interactions.

Introduction

1

The present outbreak of a coronavirus-associated acute respiratory disease, the

2

COVID-19 pandemic, has forced the scientific community to rapidly analyse the

3

virus-host relationships of the new coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) human infection. Thus,

4

in less than a month, several databases as [1–3] have been created to collect all

5

SARS-CoV-2 and COVID-19 information, and the SARS-CoV-2-human protein-protein

6

interaction network was built [4]. As stated in [5], “The Coronaviridae Study Group

7

(CSG) of the International Committee on Taxonomy of Viruses [. . . ] has assessed the

8

placement of the human pathogen, tentatively named 2019-nCoV, within the

9

Coronaviridae. Based on phylogeny, taxonomy and established practice, the CSG

10

recognizes this virus as forming a sister clade to the prototype human and bat severe

11

acute respiratory syndrome coronaviruses (SARS-CoVs) of the species Severe acute

12

respiratory syndrome-related coronavirus, and designates it as SARS-CoV-2.” Therefore,

13

the closest known human pathogen to SARS-CoV-2 is the coronavirus SARS-CoV that

14

appeared in 2003 [6], also called SARS-CoV-1.

15

Understanding the mechanism of the SARS-CoV-2 infection is a crucial step towards
the discovery of antiviral drugs and vaccines. The modus operandi of every viral

17

infection is through the interaction between viral proteins and host proteins, in order to

18

use the host cells to replicate. In this line of research, virus-host protein-protein

19

interaction networks, a particular form of protein-protein interaction networks, have

20

become appropriate to analyse virus-host relationships, and information on well-known

21

and studied virus-host protein-protein interaction networks can be carried over to new

22

ones by way of protein-protein interaction network comparison and alignment. See [7, 8]

23

for comprehensive reviews.

24

The general problem of protein-protein interaction network alignment has been

25

explored in the last two decades, and several tools have been already proposed and

26

implemented [9–14]. However, the particular case of virus-host protein-protein

27

interaction network alignment problem has not been fully studied yet.

28

We have recently developed a compact reformulation of a quadratic programming

program, which has been proven to be suitable for the alignment of virus-host

protein-protein interaction networks [15]. Our proposed model can be solved using

32

state-of-the-art mathematical modeling software such as AMPL [16] and integer linear

33

programming software tools such as IBM ILOG CPLEX Optimization Studio and

34

Gurobi Optimizer. In this work, we adapt and implement a modification of the

35

aforementioned alignment method to align the virus-host protein-protein interaction

36

networks of SARS-CoV-1 and SARS-CoV-2, in order to elucidate information on the

37

infection mechanism of SARS-CoV-2 based on current knowledge on the infection

38

mechanism of SARS-CoV-1.

Materials and methods

In the integer linear programming formulation of the protein-protein interaction

41

network alignment problem, a virus-host protein-protein interaction network is

42

represented by an undirected bipartite graph G = (U, V, E), with a node u ∈ U for each

43

virus protein, a node v ∈ V for each host protein, and an edge {u, v} ∈ E for each

44

virus-host protein-protein interaction.

45

Let G = (U, V, E) and G0 = (U 0 , V 0 , E 0 ) be the two virus-host protein-protein

46

interaction networks to be aligned, and let A = (aij ) and B = (bk` ) be their weighted

47

adjacency matrices, where the weight of an entry aij ∈ [0, 1] is the confidence score of

48

the interaction {i, j} ∈ E, and the weight of an entry bk` ∈ [0, 1] is the confidence score

49

of the interaction {k, `} ∈ E 0 . Let also S = (sik ) be a similarity matrix between the

50

nodes of the two networks, with each sik ∈ [0, 1] the similarity score of i ∈ U ∪ V and

51

k ∈ U 0 ∪ V 0.

52

Let us define a binary variable xik for each i ∈ U ∪ V and each k ∈ U 0 ∪ V 0 , where
xik = 1 if node i of the first network is aligned with node k of the second network, and

54

xik = 0 otherwise. Then, an alignment of two virus-host protein-protein interaction

55

networks G = (U, V, E) and G0 = (U 0 , V 0 , E 0 ) is represented by the binary matrix

56

X = (xik ). Let us also define an integer variable yik for each i ∈ U ∪ V and each

57

k ∈ U 0 ∪ V 0 , where each integer variable yik is intended to represent

yik = xik

for i ∈ U ∪ V and k ∈ U 0 ∪ V 0 . In this way, if xik = 0, yik = 0, and if xik = 1, yik is the

weight of those edges incident to node i in G that are preserved by the alignment.

node scores are considered when λ = 1, and only edge scores are taken into account

Results and discussion

There are 130 interactions between 29 SARS-CoV-1 proteins and 109 human proteins in

92

the March 2020 release of the VirHostNet database [1], as well as 332 interactions

93

between 26 SARS-CoV-2 proteins and 332 human proteins from [4] in release 4.2.13 of

94

the IntAct database [2]. Thus, the SARS-CoV-1-Human network has 138 nodes and 130

95

edges, while the SARS-CoV-2-Human network has 358 nodes and 332 edges. Notice

96

that only 6 of these 109 and 332 human proteins (P27448, Q5JRX3, Q7KZI7, Q9BW92,

97

Q9H4F8,and Q9Y6E2) interact with both SARS-CoV-1 and SARS-CoV-2 proteins.

98

We have obtained the amino acid sequences for the SARS-CoV-1 and human

99

proteins from UniProt/SwissProt (119 sequences), UniProt/TrEMBL (2 sequences), and

100

NCBI RefSeq (14 sequences), and for the SARS-CoV-2 and human proteins from

101

UniProt/SwissProt (332 sequences) and from the supplementary material in [4] (26

102

sequences). We have taken the global alignment score between the amino acid sequences

103

of two proteins, as implemented in BioPython [17], with a gap opening penalty of −7

104

and a gap extension penalty of −1, and normalized to [0, 1], as the similarity score

105

between the proteins. In the protein sequences of P07203 and Q9BQE4, we substituted

106

C (cysteine) for the rare amino acid U (selenocysteine). The corresponding integer

linear programming problem instance has 83,628 variables, half of which are binary, and

108

84,069 constraints.

109

The alignment of the virus-host protein-protein interaction networks of SARS-CoV-1
and SARS-CoV-2 was computed with AMPL version 2018.10.22 [16] and Gurobi

111

Optimizer version 8.1.0, using a personal computer with an Intel Core i7-8550U

112

quad-core processor at 1.80 GHz and 32 GB of memory running Ubuntu 18.04 LTS. The

113

optimal alignment was found in 517.35 seconds of AMPL time plus 3.16697 seconds of

114

solver time for SARS-CoV-1 to SARS-CoV-2, and in 538.112 seconds of AMPL time

115

plus 3.45882 seconds of solver time for SARS-CoV-2 to SARS-CoV-1. We set λ = 0.5 in

116

both cases, and took the consensus between them as the alignment of the two virus-host

117

protein-protein interaction networks.

118

We considered the host proteins that interact with the viral proteins in the

119

consensus alignment, in each of the two networks. For these human proteins we

120

obtained their Gene Ontology (GO) term annotations using GOnet [18], and measured

121

the functional similarity between aligned human proteins with GOGO [19]. Tables 1

122

(structural proteins), 2–4 (non-structural proteins), and 5 (accessory proteins) show the

123

alignment of viral proteins in the consensus alignment, along with the alignment of the

124

human proteins they interact with, their molecular function ontology (MFO) score, their

125

biological process ontology (BPO) score, and their cellular component ontology (CCO)

126

score.

127

We can observe that the four structural proteins in one network were aligned with

128

the corresponding protein in the other network. Also, most of the non-structural

129

proteins and half of the accessory proteins in one network where aligned with the

130

corresponding protein in the other network. On the other hand, for each pair of aligned

131

viral proteins, the highlighted proteins in the same column of a viral protein are the

132

human proteins it interacts with. For instance, human proteins O00303 and Q9BYF1

133

interact with the SARS-CoV-1 spike protein P59594, while human protein Q7Z5G4

134

interacts with the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein P0DTC2. Table 1 shows that O00303 is

135

aligned with P48556, Q9BYF1 is aligned with Q7L8L6, and O95295 is aligned with

136

Q7Z5G4. Missing data is due to lack of GO term annotation for the two interacting

137

proteins.

138

As can be seen in these tables, most of the aligned proteins have a cellular

component ontology score above 0.700. This means that, despite the low number of

140

conserved interactions, the aligned proteins share their cellular location. For instance,

141

those human proteins that interact with the spike protein in SARS-CoV-1 are aligned

142

with human proteins that interact with the membrane protein in SARS-CoV-2.

143

However, some biological process ontology scores between aligned human proteins are

144

very low. This can be explained by the lack of biological process ontology GO term

145

annotation for one of the two interacting proteins.

146

With respect to molecular function ontology, it is remarkable that we obtained high

147

scores for aligned proteins that interact with structurally different viral proteins. Indeed,

148

one of the measures used to test the correctness of a protein-protein interaction network

149

alignment is the edge correctness score, which measures the ratio of conserved edges in a

150

given alignment. Edge correctness assumes that one of the aims of the alignment is to

151

find similar regions between the two aligned networks, in terms of network topology. In

152

the context of protein-protein interaction networks, it is also assumed that two proteins

153

interact when they together carry out some biological function. For virus-host

154

protein-protein interaction networks, viral proteins interact with host proteins to

155

perturb the intracellular networks of their hosts to their advantage, and many virus-host

156

interactions occur at the level of physical protein-protein interactions [7]. This means

157

that a viral protein interacts with a host protein to carry out a cellular process, and this

158

pathway of virus-host interactions constitutes the infection mechanism of the virus.

159

The question then arises, when a viral protein in one network is aligned with a viral

160

protein in another network, should the host proteins that interact with one viral protein

161

be aligned with those host proteins that interact with the other viral protein? Clearly

162

the answer is yes, when the viral-host protein-protein interaction is a similar infectious

163

process stage. Therefore, aligned virus-host interactions must entail conserved stages in

164

the infectious process. However, non-conserved edges do not necessarily imply incorrect

165

alignments. Indeed, when we analyze in more depth the functional description [3] in the

166

UniProt database of the aligned human proteins that interact with Coronavirus proteins,

167

we realise that they share a function related to viral infection, although their alignment

168

introduces a non-preserved interaction. This is the case of the following pairs of proteins:

172

On the other hand, human protein Q9UHD2 interacts with viral protein

173

P0DTD1-PRO 0000449630 (orf9b) of SARS-CoV-2. However, the functional

description of the aligned human proteins reflects correctness of the consensus

alignment:

176

• O14920: Serine kinase that plays an essential role in the NF-kappa-B

signaling pathway which is activated by multiple stimuli such as

178

inflammatory cytokines, bacterial or viral products.

179

• Q9UHD2: Serine/threonine kinase that plays an essential role in regulating

inflammatory responses to foreign agents. Following activation of toll-like

receptors by viral or bacterial components, associates with TRAF3 and

186

(nucleocapsid) of SARS-CoV-2, which is aligned with protein P59595

187

(nucleocapsid) of SARS-CoV-1. On the other hand, human protein Q92499

interacts with viral protein P0C6X7-PRO 0000037320 (proofreading

description of the aligned human proteins is:

191

• Q92499: Helicase required for Coronavirus IBV replication. Antiviral defense.

192

• Q9NR30: Component of a multi-helicase-TICAM1 complex that acts as a

in the activation of a cascade of antiviral responses including the induction of

reported in [?], “has uridine-specific endoribonuclease (endoU) activity and is

201

essential for viral RNA synthesis,” with the endoU domain being “one of the most

202

conserved proteins among CoVs and related viruses, suggesting important

203

functions in the viral replicative cycle.” The functional description of the aligned

204

human proteins is:

205

• P49703: Small GTP-binding protein which cycles between an inactive

206

GDP-bound and an active GTP-bound form, and the rate of cycling is

207

regulated by guanine nucleotide exchange factors (GEF) and

208

GTPase-activating proteins (GAP).

209

• P62330: GTP-binding protein involved in protein trafficking that regulates

210

endocytic recycling and cytoskeleton remodeling. Activation is generally

211

mediated by a guanine exchange factor (GEF), while inactivation through

212

hydrolysis of bound GTP is catalyzed by a GTPase activating protein (GAP).

213

Therefore, it is not clear whether or not edge preservation should always be required
in a correct alignment of virus-host protein-protein interaction networks. To reinforce

215

this idea, we considered the functional similarity of all pairs of human proteins whose

216

alignment would preserve edges, given the consensus alignment of 24 viral proteins. For

217

each pair of aligned viral proteins (say, membrane proteins) we considered the biological

218

process, the cell component, and the molecular function ontology scores of all pairs of

219

human proteins that interact with the aligned viral proteins (say, all pairs of human

220

proteins such that the first protein interacts with viral membrane protein P59596 of

221

SARS-CoV-1 and the second protein interacts with viral membrane protein P0DTC5 of

222

SARS-CoV-2). The cell component ontology score is above 0.800 for most of the aligned

223

human proteins, but the highest molecular function ontology score is 0.852, while it is

1.000 in the consensus alignment, and the highest biological process ontology score of

the aligned human proteins is 0.670, while it is 0.863 in the consensus alignment.

232

Appendix for more details.

233

We observed that, based on current knowledge, SARS-CoV-1 and SARS-CoV-2 share

234

only 6 human proteins in their virus-host protein-protein interaction networks. On the

235

one hand, aligned viral proteins in the consensus alignment obtained with our method

236

show a sequence similarity of over 75% on the average, and most of the SARS-CoV-1

237

proteins are aligned with SARS-CoV-2 proteins that belong to the same category (spike,

238

envelope, membrane, nucleocapsid, and the various non-structural and accessory

239

proteins) in the genome organization of the viruses. On the other hand, the proposed

alignment method does not preserve the virus-host interactions. This suggests that

241

these viruses, despite their classification as human pathogens within the Coronaviridae

242

family, do not follow the same detailed mechanism of host infection. We believe that

S1 Appendix. Human proteins that interact with SARS-CoV-1 and

250

SARS-CoV-2 structural proteins, whose alignment would preserve

251

virus-host interactions. For each pair of viral protein in the consensus alignment of

252

the virus-host protein-protein interaction networks for SARS-CoV-1 and SARS-CoV-2,

253

we show the molecular function ontology (MFO) score, the biological process ontology

254

(BPO) score, and the cellular component ontology (CCO) score of the human proteins

255

they interact with, in decreasing order of average score. Missing data is due to lack of

256

GO term annotation for the two interacting proteins.
