Abstract
In December 2019, severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2)
emerged in Wuhan, Hubei Province, China. No specific treatment has been established
against coronavirus disease-2019 (COVID-19) so far. Therefore, it is urgently needed to
identify effective antiviral agents for the treatment of this disease, and several approved
drugs such as lopinavir have been evaluated. Here, we report that nelfinavir, an HIV-1
protease inhibitor, potently inhibits replication of SARS-CoV-2. The effective
concentrations for 50% and 90% inhibition (EC50 and EC90) of nelfinavir were 1.13
µM and 1.76 µM respectively, the lowest of the nine HIV-1 protease inhibitors
including lopinavir. The trough and peak serum concentrations of nelfinavir were three
to six times higher than EC50 of this drug. These results suggest that nelfinavir is a
potential candidate drug for the treatment of COVID-19 and should be assessed in
patients with COVID-19.

Introduction
In December 2019, a novel betacoronavirus, designated as severe acute respiratory
syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), emerged in Wuhan, Hubei Province, China1,2.
As of March 16, 2020, 167,515 confirmed cases with 6,606 deaths were reported, and
150 countries/territories/areas were affected.
As of now, no specific treatment has been established against coronavirus
disease-2019 (COVID-19). After the outbreak of severe acute respiratory syndrome
(SARS) in 2003, screening of approved drugs identified at least two human
immunodeficiency virus type-1 (HIV-1) protease inhibitors, lopinavir and nelfinavir, as
compounds that inhibited SARS-CoV replication in vitro3,4. In the open-label study with
SARS patients in 2004, the group treated with lopinavir-ritonavir (400 mg and 100 mg,
respectively) in addition to ribavirin showed better clinical outcomes than the control
group treated with only ribavirin3. Because SARS-CoV-2 is relatively similar to
SARS-CoV5, it is expected that these drugs will be effective for the treatment of
COVID-19 patients. To select the candidate drug for the clinical evaluation, the data of
antiviral activity in vitro are of great help. However, there is no basic information about
the effective concentration of HIV-1 protease inhibitors to abrogate SARS-CoV-2
replication. Thus, in the present study, we evaluated the antiviral activity of nine
approved HIV-1 protease inhibitors against SARS-CoV-2 in vitro.
Results and Discussion
For the evaluation of the nine HIV-1 protease inhibitors, the 50% effective
concentration (EC50), the 50% cytotoxic concentration (CC50), and the selectivity index
(SI, CC50/EC50) were analyzed. Moreover, based on the mean peak and trough serum
concentration (Cmax and Ctrough) of the compounds in human, Cmax-EC50 ratio
(Cmax/EC50) and Ctrough-EC50 ratio (Ctrough/EC50) were calculated to assess the safety and
efficacy of these compounds.
Among these inhibitors tested, the high concentrations of drugs were required to
inhibit SARS-CoV-2 replication in amprenavir (EC50 = 31.32 µM, CC50 > 81 µM, SI >
2.59), darunavir (EC50 = 46.41 µM, CC50 > 81 µM, SI > 1.75), and indinavir (EC50 =
59.14 µM CC50 > 81 µM, SI > 1.37) (Fig. 1g, h, i, j). Tipranavir inhibited replication of
SARS-CoV-2, but SI was relatively low (EC50 = 13.34 µM, CC50 = 76.80 µM, SI =
5.76) (Fig. 1f, j).

Ritonavir (EC50 = 8.63 µM, CC50 = 74.11 µM, SI = 8.59), saquinavir

(EC50 = 8.83 µM, CC50 = 44.43 µM, SI = 5.03), and atazanavir (EC50 = 9.36 µM, CC50
> 81 µM, SI > 8.65) suppressed SARS-CoV-2 at less than 10 µM (Fig. 1c, d, e, j).
Lopinavir, which has been clinically tested in patients with SARS and COVID-19,
blocked SARS-CoV-2 replication at a low concentration range and its SI was relatively
high among nine inhibitors (EC50 = 5.73 µM, CC50 = 74.44 µM, SI = 12.99) (Fig. 1b, j).
Notably, nelfinavir (EC50 = 1.13 µM, CC50 = 24.32 µM, SI = 21.52) potently inhibited
virus replication at the lowest concentration and exhibited the highest SI in the tested
HIV-1 protease inhibitors (Fig. 1a, j). To examine the target step of HIV-1 protease
inhibitors in the virus life cycle, time-of-addition assays were performed. Intra-cellular
viral RNA was quantified at 6 hpi with varying timing of drug addition. Nelfinavir and
lopinavir suppressed multiplication of viral RNA in the cells even when these drugs
were added at 3.5 hpi (Fig. S1). These results suggest that both drugs functioned at the
post-entry step.
Next, Cmax-EC50 ratio and Ctrough-EC50 ratio of nine compounds were calculated to
estimate the clinical efficacy against COVID-19. Nelfinavir (Cmax/EC50 = 6.23,
Ctrough/EC50 = 3.43), lopinavir (Cmax/EC50 = 2.72, Ctrough/EC50 = 1.97), and tipranavir
(Cmax/EC50 = 6.46, Ctrough/EC50 = 2.89) exhibited Ctrough-EC50 ratio higher than one (Fig.
1k). Ritonavir exceeded one in Cmax-EC50 ratio, but did not in Ctrough-EC50 ratio
(Cmax/EC50 = 1.80, Ctrough/EC50 = 0.56).

Saquinavir (Cmax/EC50 = 0.73, Ctrough/EC50 =

0.07), atazanavir (Cmax/EC50 = 0.93, Ctrough/EC50 = 0.19), amprenavir (Cmax/EC50 = 0.46,
Ctrough/EC50 = 0.09), darunavir (Cmax/EC50 = 0.27, Ctrough/EC50 = 0.05), and indinavir
(Cmax/EC50 = 0.21, Ctrough/EC50 = 0.004) could not reach one in the Cmax-EC50 ratio.
These results suggest that nelfinavir, lopinavir, and tipranavir can achieve EC50 of each
drug in human and are effective in the treatment of COVID-19 patients.
Nelfinavir showed the lowest EC50 (1.13 µM), the highest SI (23.32), the second
highest Cmax-EC50 ratio (6.23), and the highest Ctrough-EC50 ratio (3.43) among the tested
HIV-1 protease inhibitors. These data indicate that nelfinavir is the best of nine drugs as
a potential drug candidate for the treatment of COVID-19. Lopinavir showed the
inferior results to nelfinavir, namely, higher EC50 (5.73 µM), lower SI (12.99), lower
Cmax-EC50 ratio (2.72), and lower Ctrough-EC50 ratio (1.97) than nelfinavir. In a recent
randomized, controlled, open-label trial, lopinavir-ritonavir did not significantly
accelerate clinical improvement, reduce 28-day mortality, or decrease throat viral RNA
amount in patients with severe COVID-196. One of the reasons why the efficacy of

bioRxiv preprint doi: https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.04.06.026476; this version posted April 8, 2020. The copyright holder for this preprint

lopinavir-ritonavir was not confirmed in the clinical trial might be associated with
insufficient Cmax-EC50 and Ctrough-EC50 ratio to treat severe COVID-19. It remains to be
determined whether earlier lopinavir–ritonavir treatment in mild COVID-19 could have
clinical benefit. Tipranavir showed the highest Cmax-EC50 ratio (6.46) and the second
highest Ctrough-EC50 ratio (2.89) of all tested drugs. This is because Cmax and Ctrough are
much higher than the other tested drugs (Fig. 1j). Since SI of tipranavir was less than
that of nelfinavir (5.76 vs. 21.52), nelfinavir seems better than tipranavir. The low SI of
tipranavir may raise concern about adverse effects to COVID-19 patients.
Our findings reveal that nelfinavir is highly effective in inhibiting SARS-CoV-2
replication in vitro and has the high Cmax-EC50 and Ctough-EC50 ratio. We suggest that
nelfinavir is a potential candidate drug for the treatment of COVID-19 and should be
assessed in the patients with COVID-19.
Materials and Methods
Cells, virus, and antiviral compounds.
VeroE6 cells expressing TMPRSS2 (VeroE6/TMPRSS2)7 were maintained in
Dulbecco’s modified Eagle medium (DMEM; Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO, USA)
supplemented with 5% fetal bovine serum (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA,
USA) at 37 °C in a humidified atmosphere of 5% CO2. SARS-CoV-2 was propagated in
VeroE6/TMPRSS2 cells. All the infection experiments were performed in a biosafety
level-3 (BSL-3) laboratory. Nelfinavir a kind gift from Torii pharmaceutical Co. Ltd.,
and lopinavir was a kind gift from Abbott laboratories. Ritonavir (cat. no. HY-90001),
saquinavir (HY-17003), atazanavir (HY-17367A), tipranavir (HY-15148), amprenavir
(HY-17430), darunavir (HY-17040), and indinavir (HY-B0689A) were purchased from
MedchemExpress (Monmouth Junction, NJ, USA). Camostat (3193, Tocris Bioscience,
Minneapolis, MN, USA) and E64d (330005, Calbiochem, San Diego, CA, USA) were
used as the entry inhibitors of SARS-CoV-2.
Evaluation of cytotoxicity and antiviral activity of the drugs
Confluent cells in 96-well plates were treated with the HIV-1 protease inhibitors. After
incubation for 24 h, MTS assays were performed to measure the cell viability using
CellTiter 96 AQueous One reagent (G3580, Promega, Madison, WI, USA) according to
the manufacturer’s instructions. To evaluate the antiviral efficacy of these drugs,

confluent cells in 96-well plates were infected with virus at a MOI of 0.01 in the
presence of the drugs. After 2 h of incubation, the media with the virus-drug mixture
were removed and cells were further cultured with the drug-containing media. The cell
culture supernatants collected at 24 hpi was diluted 10-fold in water, then boiled. For
time-of-addition assay, drugs were added to cell cultures at 0 or 3.5 hpi, and
subsequently cellular RNA was extracted at 6 hpi using a CellAmp Direct RNA Prep
Kit (3732, Takara Bio Inc., Shiga, Japan). The qRT-PCR assays were performed to
quantify the amount of SARS-CoV-2 RNA with QuantStudio 3 instrument (Thermo
Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA, USA) using primers and probes described
previously8,9 (N2 set or E set).
