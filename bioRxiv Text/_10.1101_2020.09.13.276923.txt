ABSTRACT
Angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) maintains cardiovascular and renal homeostasis but also serves
as the entry receptor for the novel severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2), the causal agent
of novel coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19)1. COVID-19 disease severity, while highly variable, is typically lower
in pediatric patients than adults (particularly the elderly), but increased rates of hospitalizations requiring intensive
care are observed in infants than in older children. The reasons for these differences are unknown. To detect
potential age-based correlates of disease severity, we measured ACE2 protein expression at the single cell level
in human lung tissue specimens from over 100 donors from ~4 months to 75 years of age. We found that expression
of ACE2 in distal lung epithelial cells generally increases with advancing age but exhibits extreme intra- and interindividual heterogeneity. Notably, we also detected ACE2 expression on neonatal airway epithelial cells and within
the lung parenchyma. Similar patterns were found at the transcript level: ACE2 mRNA is expressed in the lung and
trachea shortly after birth, downregulated during childhood, and again expressed at high levels in late adulthood
in alveolar epithelial cells. Furthermore, we find that apoptosis, which is a natural host defense system against
viral infection, is also dynamically regulated during lung maturation, resulting in periods of heightened apoptotic
priming and dependence on pro-survival BCL-2 family proteins including MCL-1. Infection of human lung cells with
SARS-CoV-2 triggers an unfolded protein stress response and upregulation of the endogenous MCL-1 inhibitor
Noxa; in juveniles, MCL-1 inhibition is sufficient to trigger apoptosis in lung epithelial cells – this may limit virion
production and inflammatory signaling. Overall, we identify strong and distinct correlates of COVID-19 disease
severity across lifespan and advance our understanding of the regulation of ACE2 and cell death programs in the
mammalian lung. Furthermore, our work provides the framework for potential translation of apoptosis modulating
drugs as novel treatments for COVID-19.
INTRODUCTION
The novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19) pandemic has caused infection of over 25.6 million individuals
globally as of 31 August 20202. Disease severity is typically lower in pediatric patients than adults (particularly the elderly),
but higher rates of hospitalizations requiring intensive care are observed in infants than in older children3–5. The causal
agent for COVID-19, the novel severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2), infects host cells through
interaction with the cell surface proteins angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) and the transmembrane serine
protease TMPRSS21. For SARS-CoV-2 infection to occur, the spike protein of a viral particle must bind ACE2 and
undergo cleavage by TMPRSS2 to allow fusion with the host plasma membrane and cell entry1. In the lung, where this
process is known to occur, developmental processes in early life require coordinated regulation of gene expression to
ensure proper formation and maturation of airways and alveoli6. It remains unknown how these developmental processes
affect ACE2 expression and potentially contribute to differences in COVID-19 disease severity across lifespan.
In addition to its role in SARS-CoV-2 infection, ACE2 regulates vascular homeostasis as part of the reninangiotensin system7. In this normal physiological role, ACE2 is expressed on cell membranes in a number of tissues
outside the lung. Several single-cell transcriptomic analyses have been performed to determine the tissue and cell type
distribution of ACE2 expression8–11. Although they have identified cell types that may be susceptible to infection, these
studies generally lack data across different ages and are unable to examine ACE2 translation and localization. Proteinlevel measurements, therefore, are required to determine whether ACE2 mRNA expression correlates robustly with
translated, membrane localized protein expression.

Viral entry represents just one of several steps in COVID-19 pathogenesis, each of which involves genes that
may potentially be developmentally regulated in the lung and elsewhere. Apoptotic and non-apoptotic host cell death
pathways also play important roles as they can modulate disease pathogenesis after viral infection12,13. Specifically,
coronavirus-infected cells typically experience endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress due the excessive production of
infectious virions and consequently activate the unfolded protein response (UPR) to adapt to this stress14. If the ER stress
is overwhelming, the cell undergoes intrinsic apoptosis (programmed cell death) by upregulating pro-apoptotic proteins –
this serves as a host defense mechanism by arresting virion production. Interestingly, virally-encoded proteins may
suppress this process during infection to enhance virion production15–17. Apoptosis is controlled by the members of the
BCL-2 family of proteins, which have pro-death or pro-survival roles in modulating mitochondrial release of cytochrome c,
the commitment point for intrinsic apoptosis18. We have previously found that apoptosis is dynamically regulated during
lifespan in multiple organs as they grow and mature19 - this could impact the degree to which cells tolerate ER stress and
thus extent of virion production upon infection.
Herein, we investigate how expression of viral entry and cell death genes in the lung might vary among different
age groups and how it relates to known differences in disease severity. We find age-based differences in ACE2
expression in mouse lung tissue that correlate with varying severity of human COVID-19 symptoms in adults, children,
and neonates. Importantly, we validate these differences by measuring expression of ACE2 at the protein level across
over 100 normal lung tissue specimens, extending the results of previous transcriptomic analyses. Notably, we detected
increased expression of this viral receptor on multiple cell types in the lung during key life stages and extreme levels of
inter- and intra-individual heterogeneity that may influence disease course across populations. Finally, we find that
apoptosis is dynamically regulated in the postnatal lung to create periods of heightened apoptotic priming and
dependence on pro-survival proteins that can limit the extent of virion production upon SARS-CoV-2 infection and has
implications for clinical translation.

RESULTS
In mouse and human lung, developmental processes in postnatal life require coordinated regulation of gene
expression in epithelial and endothelial cells to ensure proper formation and maturation of airways and highly vascularized
alveoli6. The importance of ACE2 in maintaining vascular homeostasis suggests that it may also be dynamically regulated
in the lung throughout life, which may in turn impact cellular entry and infection by coronaviruses including SARS-CoV-220.
Although previous reports have demonstrated expression of ACE2 in various adult cell types within the lung as well as in
small intestine, kidney, and testis tissue8–11, we sought to characterize how ACE2 expression changes at the transcript
and protein levels across the mammalian lifespan.
To detect potential changes in expression, we stained for ACE2 and cell markers of interest in two tissue
microarrays (TMA) comprising over 100 normal lung specimens from individuals ranging from 9 to 75 years of age. Due to
the pronounced autofluorescence of red blood cells (Figure 1A), we identified and segmented cells that stained positive
for DAPI to evaluate total cellular ACE2 expression levels in 1,408,152 nucleated cells (Figure 1B). We first compared
ACE2 expression in all lung cells across all individuals (Figure 1C) and found that the percentage of ACE2-expressing
cells in the lung increased with age but was profoundly heterogeneous (Figure 1D-F). In fact, while some normal lung
tissues from similarly aged individuals contained an extensive number of ACE2 + cells (>70% of DAPI+), others expressed
very few cells in the distal lung that can be infected by SARS-CoV-2 (<5% of DAPI+). We attempted to identify the cell
types in which ACE2 was expressed by co-staining for podoplanin (PDPN), a marker commonly expressed on alveolar
type 1 (AT1) cells that are responsible for gas exchange. Co-staining with PDPN showed increasing ACE2 expression in
PDPN+ cells with age and again demonstrated extensive heterogeneity within and between individuals (Figure 1G-J).
However, while we observed ACE2+ PDPN+ cells, their morphology was cuboidal instead of thin and elongated as would
be typically found in AT1 cells. This suggests that they may in fact be alveolar type 2 (AT2) cells, which secrete surfactant
and regenerate the alveolar epithelium, including AT1 cells, after injury21. Also, while PDPN was detected in these cells, it
was observed primarily in intracellular puncta, rather than on the luminal surface found commonly on AT1 cells. These
unexpected differences in PDPN staining may be due to the TMA tissue being sourced from patients at autopsy or from
normal lung tissue adjacent to lung tumors (see methods); either of these, as well as environmental or disease-associated
factors, could potentially reduce the specificity of PDPN staining for AT1 cells or alter AT1 cell morphology22,23. Finally,
although lung specimens from male donors tended to have higher expression of ACE2 in nucleated (Figure S1J) and
PDPN+ (Figure S1K) cells than female donors, the differences were not statistically significant and similar age-based
trends were evident for both sexes.
We next assessed levels of ACE2 expression specifically in AT2 cells by staining for aquaporin 3 (AQP3) in the
two TMAs. In contrast with PDPN+ cells, expression of ACE2 did not increase with age in AT2 cells in these specimens
(Figure 2A-D), although several of the specimens were removed from analysis due to inadequate specimen quantity or
quality (see methods). The expression of ACE2 was again highly heterogeneous (Figure 2E) with similarly aged

individuals expressing a wide range of ACE2 positivity (from ~0 to >90%). Since our TMAs did not contain specimens
from neonates or infants, we next sought to obtain neonatal lung tissue to assess the early-life expression of ACE2 in
human lung tissue. We detected ACE2 expression on the apical surfaces of airway epithelial cells (likely club cells) in
infant (age 3-5 months) lung tissue (Figure 2F, G). We also detected ACE2+ cells outside of the airway, where it seemed
to be expressed on epithelial cells.
Given the heterogeneity we observed in human ACE2 expression, we reasoned that examining ACE2 expression
in inbred mouse strains might minimize inter-individual variation and validate the age-dependent changes we observed in
human tissue. Although some temporal and spatial aspects of lung maturation vary between the mouse and human, the
stages of lung development are similar across all mammalian species24. In both the human and murine lung,
alveologenesis (formation of highly vascularized alveoli, which are the primary gas-exchange units in the lung), begins
prenatally but isn’t complete until young adulthood24 (~P36 in mice, ~21 years of age in human25,26). Furthermore, mouse
models have become critical for research into coronavirus infection pathogenesis. In particular, these models have shown
that host age, virus-host protein-protein interactions, and expression levels of viral receptors can all affect the “effective
dose” of viral particles experienced by cells in the lung; this dosage can in turn determine the severity of symptoms (Table
1)27. Therefore, we queried expression of both Ace2 and the serine protease Tmprss2 (a host cell protease required for
SARS-CoV-2 cell entry after binding to ACE220) across 156 samples comprising 31 microarray experiments using a tool
for combined analysis of published microarray data28. We found that lung tissue collected from newborn mice (postnatal
day 0-3 [P0-P3]) exhibited higher Ace2 expression levels than P4-15 adolescent mice and that expression increased
steadily after adolescence through to advanced age (P256+) (Figure 3A). A similar expression pattern was observed for
Tmprss2, although the magnitude of differences was smaller (Figure S2A). We confirmed these results in a separate set
of 66 samples from 5 additional experiments using a distinct microarray platform (Figure S2B-C).
For individual experiments from this collected dataset that included detailed time course data, patterns matched
those observed in the combined data. Analysis of a study of gene expression in P0, P3, P10, and P42 mice showed only
minor changes in Tmprss2 levels in whole lung and trachea, but Ace2 expression was lower at P10 than all other
timepoints in both tissues29 (Figure 3B). Ace2 and Tmprss2 were expressed at high levels in alveolar macrophages at P0
before declining substantially at P3 and later. Similarly, Tmprss2 and Ace2 levels were highest immediately after birth in a
study of lung tissue at P0, P1, and P330 (Figure 3C). Another study of tissue from P1, P8, and P28 mice did not show a
decline in Ace2 levels at P8, but did show elevated expression at P2831 (Figure S2D). Thus, across a diverse set of
microarray datasets, lung Ace2 levels were relatively high immediately after birth, significantly lower during adolescence,
and increased in adulthood, reaching their peak at advanced age.
To complement these microarray data, we queried the Lung Gene Expression Analysis (LGEA) database of
mouse RNA-seq data across developmental timepoints32. We again found that expression of Ace2 and Tmprss2 peaked
around birth, declined in young mice, and increased again in older mice (Figure 3D, E). In sorted cells from the LGEA
dataset, Ace2 levels in epithelial cells were high at birth and were reduced shortly after, followed by an upregulation when
alveologenesis is nearing completion24 (Figure 3F). Ace2 expression in vascular endothelial cells peaked at birth and then
decreased by P30. Tmprss2 was similarly expressed during this time period (Figure S2E).
In our human lung TMA experiments, we had examined ACE2 expression at the protein level but did not analyze
ACE2 mRNA transcripts. To compare with mouse transcriptional data, we analyzed the LungMAP database, which
contains RNA-seq data for sorted human lung cell types from donors of varying age 33. Consistent with murine data,
human epithelial cell expression of ACE2 and TMPRSS2 was detected in neonates, infants, children, and young adults
(24-40 years of age), with the highest levels evident in infant lung tissue (Figure 3G, H). The heterogeneity between
individuals was consistent with the protein-level heterogeneity observed in our analysis of the TMAs. Endothelial cells
within the human lung expressed higher ACE2 in adults than at other ages, although the sample size was limited.
These mouse and human data showed similar trends in expression by bulk RNA-seq, but the sorting strategy
employed in this analysis combined epithelial cells of various subtypes. Previous reports have demonstrated expression
of Ace2 specifically in AT2 epithelial cells8,10; we sought to determine whether this expression might vary with time. In
single cell RNA-seq data for AT2 cells and their embryonic precursors, we found Ace2 and Tmprss2 can be expressed in
AT2 cells as early as embryonic day 12 through to P7 (Figure 3I and S2F). In middle adulthood (4 months), single-cell
RNA-seq data showed that AT2 cells may express Ace2 and Tmprss2, but broader expression was detected in
bronchiolar epithelial cells including club and goblet cells (Figure 3J-N). These data strongly suggested that Ace2 is
dynamically expressed in major lung cell types during postnatal life, potentially modulating (in concert with Tmprss2 and
other proteases) the number and type of cells susceptible to SARS-CoV-2 infection (summarized in Table 2).
For a more direct comparison with our TMA staining, we next sought to investigate ACE2 protein expression
dynamics directly in mouse lung tissue across lifespan. We stained for ACE2 and relevant cell markers in lung tissue from
newborn (P0), young (P7), adult (3 months) and late adult (11 months) mice (Figure 4). We detected slightly elevated
levels of ACE2 across all nucleated cells immediately after birth, which were lower at P7 and increased by adulthood (3

months) (Figure 4A-B). We found that the higher perinatal ACE2 levels were at least in part attributable to its expression
in AQP3 positive AT2 cells (Figure 4A, C), which was consistent with our gene expression analysis. Unexpectedly, we
also found that ACE2 protein expression was strongly increased by late adulthood in AT2 cells, and that it was expressed
throughout the cell including the nucleus (Figure 4A). We also stained for secretoglobin 1A1 (SCGB1A1), a marker for
club cells within the airway (Figure 4D, E), and found that expression levels were high at P0, downregulated by P7, and
increased at later ages. Finally, in agreement with our human TMA data, faintly ACE2+ cells were observed that could be
AT1 given their proximity to PDPN (Figure 4, G). However, an AT2 co-stain as well as another AT1 marker (e.g. receptor
for advanced glycation end products - RAGE) would be required to confirm whether they are bona fide AT1 cells. In
summary, we detected age-based differences in ACE2 expression in multiple cell types within the lung (Figure 4H), which
may delineate the pool of cells that can be infected by SARS-CoV-2 at different ages. Intriguingly, changes in ACE2
expression, which are heterogeneous but broadly consistent across mouse and human samples, are correlated with
COVID-19 disease severity in human patients (Figure S1A-C).
These patterns suggested that higher lung ACE2 expression in infancy and late adulthood would broaden the
pool of cells that can be potentially infected by SARS-CoV-2 at those ages. However, in response to cellular stress
induced by viral infection, cells frequently trigger apoptosis as a host defense mechanism12,13. In the case of
coronaviruses, active infection and stimulation of virion production typically results in proteotoxic stress and consequent
activation of the unfolded protein response (UPR)16, which is also a potent inducer of apoptotic cell death34,35. Apoptosis
can be suppressed during infection by virally-encoded proteins to prolong virion production15–17. Members of the BCL-2
family of genes play pro-death and pro-survival roles in modulating apoptosis18, which may affect not only viral production
but also tissue damage and immune responses. We therefore investigated how the expression of BCL-2 family genes
changes in response to SARS-CoV-2 infection within a recently reported study36. We first confirmed that productive
SARS-CoV-2 infection of lung cell lines Calu-3 and A549 (both WT and ACE2 overexpressing) potently activates the
unfolded protein response as evidenced by the upregulation of canonical UPR-associated genes ATF4 and DDIT3
(C/EBP homologous protein [CHOP]) (Figure 5A, S3A). Furthermore, active infection also induced expression of proapoptotic BIM (BCL2L11) and especially the endogenous MCL-1 inhibitor protein Noxa (PMAIP1). Upregulation of Noxa is
sufficient to induce apoptosis in MCL-1 dependent cells37,38 and enhances dependence on other pro-survival proteins
such as BCL-2 or BCL-XL39,40.
We next assessed how BCL-2 family genes were regulated during postnatal lung maturation to potentially
modulate cell fate in response to SARS-CoV-2 infection. In LGEA RNA-seq data, pro-apoptotic genes Bcl2l11 (encoding
BIM) and Bmf were both highly expressed in young mouse lung tissue; both peaked at P1 and declined over the
remaining timepoints until P28 (late juvenile, early adult) (Figure 5B-C, S2B). Among pro-survival BCL-2 family members,
Mcl1 was most highly expressed, and similarly peaked at P1, as did the more moderately expressed Bcl2 (Figure S2C). In
contrast, expression of Bcl2l1 (coding for pro-survival BCL-XL protein) was low in P1 mice but increased by P28. Bax and
Bak1, which encode pore-forming proteins that trigger the apoptotic cascade when pro-apoptotic Bcl-2 family members
overwhelm pro-survival family members, were expressed at levels likely sufficient to allow apoptosis execution at all
timepoints (Figure S2D).
We next tested whether similar expression changes in BCL-2 family genes would be evident in human lung
tissue. We examined BCL-2 family RNA-seq data in epithelial cells within the LungMAP database and found that
expression patterns were largely consistent with mouse data. Pro-apoptotic BCL2L11 and BMF were again expressed at
increased levels in early life (neonates) and reduced in adult lung tissue while pro-survival MCL1, BCL2A1 (encoding
BFL-1/A1) and BCL2L1 (BCL-XL) increased with age (Figure 5D-G, S2E-G). These changes, consistent with a decrease
in apoptotic priming over time, were observed predominantly in epithelial and endothelial cells of the human lung.
These gene expression patterns suggested that young lung tissue would be more prone to undergoing apoptotic
cell death. We tested this at the functional level using BH3 profiling, an assay that tests mitochondrial sensitivity to titrated
doses of apoptosis-inducing peptides (Figure 5H, S2H)41. We found that lung epithelial cells (EPCAM+) are highly primed
for apoptosis at early age as evidenced by higher levels of cytochrome c release in response to pro-apoptotic BIM or BID
BH3 peptides in young (P1-P15) versus older lung tissue (Figure 5I). Importantly, adult lung epithelial cells were more
resistant to apoptosis, but the pathway remained intact as indicated by continued sensitivity to higher concentrations of
BH3 peptides. Interestingly, BH3 profiling also demonstrated that lung epithelial cells in the youngest mice were
dependent on BCL-2 and/or BCL-XL for survival but that this dependence switched to MCL-1 in the P12-P15 animals
(Figure 5J). Combined with results from cells actively infected with SARS-CoV-2 (Figure 5A-B), these data suggest that
infection of lung epithelial cells would trigger apoptosis more quickly and readily in the young lung than in the adult to limit
further virion production. Indeed, apoptotic resistance of infected cells has been previously shown to increase virion
production, infection severity and host mortality12,42–45.
While impairment of lung function is a major source of morbidity and mortality for COVID-19 patients, severe
damage to the cardiovascular, renal and gastrointestinal systems by SARS-CoV-2 is also evident in patients with poor

outcomes46. We therefore compared the expression of SARS-CoV-2 cell entry genes across major organs and found that
ACE2 expression in human lung was low, and TMPRSS2 expression was high, relative to other organs (Figure 6A) – this
is consistent with our immunofluorescence analysis showing cell type-specific lung expression of ACE2 at most ages.
Throughout the respiratory system, TMPRSS2 and ACE2 were broadly expressed and, consistent with previous reports,
ACE2 expression was particularly high in the nasopharynx11,47. Also consistent with previous reports48, ACE2 expression
was high in several extrapulmonary tissues, including human testis, kidney, and GI tract – several of these were
confirmed at the protein level by mass spectrometry49 (Figure 6B).
Finally, we extended our age-dependent gene expression analysis to additional human tissues to examine how
ACE2 and TMPRSS2 levels might change over lifespan. While cardiac tissue expressed ACE2 throughout prenatal and
postnatal life, expression levels were particularly high in early childhood and then declined with age (Figure 6C)50. It is
unclear whether this may be linked to the increasing evidence of cardiac dysfunction in young children diagnosed with
COVID-19 (whether via the enzymatic function of ACE2 or its role as a viral entry receptor)51,52. A similar pattern was
observed in testis tissue (Figure 6D). Little or no ACE2 expression was detected across lifespan in the brain or liver
(Figure S4A-C); limited postnatal expression data was available for kidney and ovary tissue, but available timepoints
showed moderate expression in the former and low expression in the latter (Figure S4A-E). Proteomic and genomic
measurements were mismatched for some tissues (e.g. ovary), suggesting potential posttranscriptional regulation of
ACE2 levels.

DISCUSSION
Our studies provide evidence that ACE2, TMPRSS2 and apoptotic programs are dynamically regulated by age
and cell type in the lung and correlate with severity of COVID-19 disease. Based on our study and our current
understanding of SARS-CoV-2 infection, it is plausible that increased expression of ACE2 in airway and alveolar epithelial
cells in infancy and old age contributes to the relative severity of COVID-19 symptoms in these populations (Tables 2 and
3). Furthermore, the strong upregulation of ACE2 in late adulthood across multiple cell types in the lung increases the
number of cells that can potentially be infected by SARS-CoV-2. ACE2 expression on fragile AT1 cells could be especially
problematic given their roles in barrier function and gas exchange. In severe cases of COVID-19, leakage of blood plasma
and interstitial fluid into the airspace can occur, along with severe inflammation and hyperproliferation of AT2 cells46,53;
rapid loss of infected AT1 cells would be expected to promote all these responses.
Our study also demonstrates that the apoptotic priming of young lung tissue is higher relative to adults; this has
been previously associated with decreased virion production due to earlier induction of apoptosis15,16. Our results suggest
that this mechanism, along with reduced ACE2 expression, may reduce COVID19 disease severity in children.
It is important to note that our study has limited racial diversity among donors of the TMA lung tissue. Only Asian
individuals were represented in these TMAs, preventing analysis of racial or ethnic differences in ACE2 expression.
However, given the substantial impact of social determinants of health on variable COVID19 mortality rates among racial
groups in the U.S.54, it is perhaps unlikely that ACE2 expression is a major contributor to these racial disparities.
Our results have important implications for the development of therapeutic approaches to COVID19. One
therapeutic under investigation is human recombinant soluble ACE2 (hrsACE2) 55; our results support the feasibility of this
approach, but suggest that with increasing age in patients, the number of available receptors for SARS-CoV-2 continually
increases, perhaps necessitating increasing doses of hrsACE2 to “compete away” viral particles from host cell receptors.
It remains unclear how the enzymatic activity of hrsACE2 might affect patient physiology and antiviral responses via
effects on the renin-angiotensin system. Our findings also suggest a potential therapeutic approach focused on cell death
responses to infection, wherein apoptotic priming in adult lung tissue would be modulated to match that in pediatric lung.
This approach, which could involve administration of BH3 mimetics (small molecule BCL-2 family inhibitors56) systemically
or directly to lung tissue via inhalation, would be expected to reduce virus replication in adults as infected, stressed cells
would undergo apoptosis earlier. Given the potential role of apoptotic cell death in suppressing inflammation, such a
treatment might further reduce negative outcomes in infected patients by immune-mediated mechanisms57. Finally, the
use of drugs that inhibit the activity of UPR proteins such as PERK or IRE1 may impair ER stress responses, increase
apoptotic signaling and accelerate the commitment to apoptosis in infected cells to reduce virion production16,58. However,
in each of these cases, the potential tissue damaging effects of apoptosis promotion require careful consideration
It is important to note that initial infection and cell death are only two of an extensive set of factors influencing
disease course in COVID-19 patients. Immune response36,59, host genetics60, environmental factors8, and therapeutic
interventions61,62 may all play contributing roles in determining infection outcome. Further, due to the dynamic regulation of
blood pressure, fluid and electrolytes by the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system63, it is likely that inter- and intraindividual variation in ACE2 expression will also impact disease course, which is consistent with the extreme

ACE2, TMRPRSS2 and apoptosis sensitivity in the lung shed light on potential determinants of disease severity in highly
susceptible individuals.

METHODS
Animal care and use
Mouse tissue immunofluorescence experiments described in these studies were approved by the Johns Hopkins University
Animal Care and Use Committee (Protocol Number: M019M332) and were performed according to the Guide for the Care
and Use of Laboratory Animals of the National Institutes of Health. Male and female C57BL/6J mice were obtained from the
Jackson Laboratory (#000664, Bar Harbor, ME) and bred and housed in the Johns Hopkins animal facility.
For BH3 profiling, cohorts of mice were housed and bred in a colony in accordance with the policies and regulations set
forth by the Harvard TH Chan School of Public Health’s IACUC, under protocol 5245. All animal experiments were approved
by IACUC under HSPH protocol #IS00001059-3. Black 6 mice, strain C57BL/6J, (WT) (Jackson Laboratories) were used
for tissue collection.
Human tissue samples
Human tissue microarrays were obtained from US Biomax, Inc. (Derwood, MD). Arrays LCN241 and LC2086a were selected
to represent the broadest possible age range of donors and overlapping donors from the two cores were excluded from
analysis of LC2086a. Properties of the donors are shown in Supplemental Figure 4. Morphology of the analyzed cores was
examined by a pathologist for signs of lung disease; the pathologist’s analysis is shown in Supplemental Figure 4 and cores
showing evidence of hemorrhage were excluded to avoid errors in quantification arising from the autofluorescence of red
blood cells in the stained cores.
Human infant lung samples were obtained and processed at autopsy from either patients with necrotizing enterocolitis or
age-matched infants that died from unrelated conditions that did not affect the lungs, with approval from the University of
Pittsburgh Institutional Review Board (CORID No. 491) and in accordance with the University of Pittsburgh anatomical
tissue procurement guidelines. All samples were de-identified via an independent honest broker assurance mechanism
(Approval #: HB#043) and transferred to Johns Hopkins University under the guidance of MTA approval (JUH MTA #
A26558) for analysis.
Analysis of public gene expression databases
Mouse and human microarray data were analyzed using Genevestigator (NEBION, Zurich, Switzerland). Mouse data were
filtered to exclude non-wild type genetic backgrounds and experimental treatments. The remaining lung gene expression
data were grouped by age and exported to generate plots. For human microarray data, samples were filtered to exclude
disease conditions or drug treatments. The remaining data were grouped by anatomy. Some exported groups included
broader (e.g. organ system) or narrower (e.g. organ, organ substructure) classifications; all the sample groups plotted were
mutually exclusive.
RNA-seq data was obtained from the LGEA32 and LungMAP33 databases, with corresponding protein levels in
extrapulmonary tissues confirmed using the Human Proteome Map 49 database. RNA sequencing data from SARS-CoV-2
infected cell lines was obtained from GEO accession GSE147507 36.
Single cell RNA sequencing
Previously published73,74 single cell RNA sequencing datasets were analyzed for expression of genes of interest. Time
course data were from accession GSE119228 and 4 month data were from accession GSE121611. Processing was
performed using the Seurat package in R75.
Immunofluorescence sample preparation and imaging
Immunofluorescent staining of lung tissues was performed on 4% paraformaldehyde-fixed 5 μm-thick paraffin sections. The
sections were first warmed to 56°C in a vacuum incubator (Isotemp Vacuum Oven, Fisher Scientific) then washed
immediately twice in xylene, gradually re-dehydrated in ethanol (100%, 95%, 70%, water), and then processed for antigen
retrieval by microwave heating (1000 watt, 6 minutes) in citrate buffer (10mM, pH6.0). Samples were then washed with
PBS, blocked with 1% BSA/5% donkey-serum (1 hour, room temperature), then incubated overnight at 4°C with primary
antibodies (1:200 dilutions in 0.5% BSA). The following day, samples were washed 3 times with PBS and incubated with
appropriate fluorescent-labeled secondary antibodies (1:1000 dilution in 0.5% BSA, Life Technologies Inc) and the nuclear
marker DAPI (Biolegend). Slides were mounted using Gelvatol (Sigma-Aldrich) solution prior to imaging. Initial imaging was
carried out using a 40x/1.3NA objective lens on a Nikon Eclipse Ti Confocal microscope (Nikon, Melville, NY). Pixel sizes
were 0.15 microns and z step size of 5 microns. High-resolution imaging was then conducted on the identical slides with a
Fluoview 1000 (Olympus Waltham, MA). Antibodies used for mouse lung immunostaining are listed in Table 4. Human TMA
samples were imaged on a widefield Rarecyte Cytefinder slide scanner with a 20x/0.75NA objective lens with pixel size
0.65 microns/pixel. The excitation and emission filters were DAPI (ex: 395/25, em: 438/26), FITC (ex: 485/25, em: 522/20),

Cy3 (ex: 555/20, em: 590/20), and Cy5 (ex: 651/11, em: 692/44). Exposure times were adjusted to maximize dynamic range
and eliminate saturation. High resolution representative images from selected cores were acquired using a Zeiss LSM 880
confocal microscope.
Image quantification
For quantification of immunofluorescence images of mouse samples, image datasets were saved as .nd2 files and analyzed
as maximum intensity projections since tissue samples had a thickness of one cell layer. Cells were segmented into
individual objects based on the DAPI channel. Due to the fact that nuclei boundaries are ambiguous and hard to identify in
tissue, we applied a preprocessing semantic segmentation step using a UNet model76 trained on hand annotated DAPIstained mouse and human tissue (https://github.com/HMS-IDAC/UnMicst). The architecture of the implemented model was
similar to Saka et al. (2019)77. Briefly, the model was trained to recognize and generate probability maps for nuclei contours,
nuclei centers, and background pixels. Cellprofiler78 was then used to further segment nuclei based on the nuclei center
probability maps made by the UNet model.
In Cellprofiler, nuclei were identified using the Identify Primary Objects module where clumped cells were identified based
on shape. Next, the corresponding whole cell region was obtained using the Identify Secondary Objects and dilating by 4
pixels since a common cytoplasm channel was absent from the experiment. The cytoplasmic regions were then obtained
using Identify Tertiary Objects. Before acquiring measurements, the green, red and Cy5 channels were background
subtracted by sampling the background intensities in the lower quartile range. The background subtracted median intensities
were then measured on a per-cell basis and exported to a csv file separated by nuclei, cytoplasm, and cell mask regions
with entire cell mask region being used for further analysis. Segmentation mask overlays were also saved and inspected to
evaluate the quality of segmentation. Image quantification values were reported as background-subtracted median ACE2
intensities in either all cells (DAPI+) or in cells positive (above background) for indicated markers.
For quantification of the human TMA samples, images were acquired as separate overlapping tiles from a slidescanner.
These
tiles
were
stitched
using
ASHLAR,
a
novel
stitching
and
registration
algorithm
(https://github.com/labsyspharm/ashlar). Other custom scripts were used to 1) systematically separate the stitched image
into organized individual tissue cores (Coreograph; https://github.com/HMS-IDAC/UNetCoreograph), preprocess the image
to identify cells and suppress artefacts based on the DAPI channel (UnMicst; https://github.com/HMS-IDAC/UnMicst), and
segment cells into individual objects (S3segmenter; https://github.com/HMS-IDAC/S3segmenter). Upon closer inspection,
we noticed that the staining quality of DAPI on the tissue cores was variable despite staining all cores under the same
conditions. It is known that DNA deteriorates with age of sample causing lower binding of DAPI. This causes the signal-tobackground ratio to be low where the nuclei are obfuscated by tissue autofluorescence and finally leading to poor nuclei
segmentation. We therefore inspected each core and only retained cores that had prominent DAPI staining above
background. From these remaining cores, background subtracted mean and median intensity measurements were obtained
on a single-cell basis and exported to a csv file. Because running a large number of cores manually would be tedious, prone
to errors, and require significant computational resources, all processes (stitching, core separation, preprocessing, single
cell segmentation, and quantification) were incorporated into a unified automated pipeline (mcmicro;
https://github.com/labsyspharm/mcmicro) that processed all samples in parallel on a high performance cluster. The
background subtracted median intensities were then measured on a per-cell basis and exported to a csv file separated by
nuclei, cytoplasm, and cell mask regions with entire cell mask being used for further analysis. Cores containing fewer than
100 cells of a given type were excluded from analysis. Segmentation mask overlays were also saved and inspected to
evaluate the quality of segmentation. Image quantification values were reported as background-subtracted ACE2 median
intensities in either all cells (DAPI+) or in cells positive (above background) for indicated markers.
BH3 profiling
Lung samples from mice of different ages (P0-P62) were dissociated into a single cell suspension using the Papain
Dissociation System (Worthington Biochemical Corporation) with a modified protocol. Briefly, 50-100g lung samples were
roughly chopped and submerged in 500μL of EBSS with 20 units/ml papain and 0.005% DNase and incubated at 37°C with
frequent agitation for 15 minutes. Samples were placed on ice and triturated with cut 1ml pipette, and were left to settle for
2-5 minutes before the cloudy cell suspension was transferred to new tubes and centrifuged at 200g for 5 minutes at 4°C.
The resulting pellet was resuspended in EBSS with 0.005% DNase, 1mg/ml bovine serum albumin and 1mg/ml Ovomucoid
protease inhibitor. This suspension was layered on top of a solution of EBSS with 10mg/ml bovine serum albumin and
10mg/ml Ovomucoid protease inhibitor to create a discontinuous density gradient, and then centrifuged at 72g for 6 minutes
at room temperature. Supernatant was discarded and the pellet was resuspended in 100µl FACS Stain Buffer (2% FBS in
PBS) with 1µl anti-CD45-APC/Cy7 (clone 30-F11, BioLegend) and 1µl anti-EPCAM-AlexaFluor488 (clone G8.8,
BioLegend).
Cells were stained on ice for 25 minutes away from light, then centrifuged at 200g for 5 minutes and subjected to flow
cytometry-based BH3 profiling as previously described 41. Briefly, cells were treated with activator or sensitizer BH3
