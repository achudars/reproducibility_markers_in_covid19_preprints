Abstract
COVID-19 is prevalent in the elderly. Old individuals are more likely to develop pneumonia and
respiratory failure due to alveolar damage, suggesting that lung senescence may increase the
susceptibility to SARS-CoV-2 infection and replication. Considering that human coronavirus
(HCoVs; SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV) require host cellular factors for infection and replication,
we analyzed Genotype-Tissue Expression (GTEx) data to test whether lung aging is associated with
transcriptional changes in human protein-coding genes that potentially interact with these viruses.
We found decreased expression of the gene tribbles homolog 3 (TRIB3) during aging in male
individuals, and its protein was predicted to interact with HCoVs nucleocapsid protein and RNAdependent RNA polymerase. Using publicly available lung single-cell data, we found TRIB3
expressed mainly in alveolar epithelial cells that express SARS-CoV-2 receptor ACE2. Functional
enrichment analysis of age-related genes, in common with SARS-CoV-induced perturbations,
revealed genes associated with the mitotic cell cycle and surfactant metabolism. Given that TRIB3
was previously reported to decrease virus infection and replication, the decreased expression of
TRIB3 in aged lungs may help explain why older male patients are related to more severe cases of
the COVID-19. Thus, drugs that stimulate TRIB3 expression should be evaluated as a potential
therapy for the disease.

Introduction
The first cases of infections with the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV2) in humans were identified in December 2019 in Wuhan, China1,2, and since then, the coronavirus
disease 2019 (COVID-19) rapidly became pandemic3. Studies have shown that older individuals
with comorbidities are associated with more severe cases of COVID-194. These patients are more
likely to develop pneumonia and respiratory failure due to alveolar damage5,6, suggesting that lung
aging impacts disease progression and mortality.
SARS-CoV-2 requires host cellular factors for successful infection and replication7. For example,
angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) is the receptor for the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein
receptor-binding domain (RBD) for viral attachment7,8. The conserved evolutionary relationship
between the 2019 novel SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV9 opens up the possibility to explore the
relationships between these human coronaviruses (HCoVs) in public databases. Computational
predictions of SARS-CoV–human protein-protein interactions (PPIs) may identify mechanisms of
viral infection and drug targets9–11. In this context, the Genotype-Tissue Expression (GTEx)
database12,13 has provided insights into age-related genes14,15 and, associated with single-cell
transcriptomics, could predict SARS-CoV-2–PPIs in aging lungs. This characterization is crucial for
older adults, which are more vulnerable to the disease16–18. Thus, we analyzed whether lung aging is
associated with transcriptional changes in proteins that potentially interact with SARS-CoV-2.
We first identified differentially expressed genes (DEGs) during aging in GTEx human lung samples
(release V7) (Data S1). The numbers of significant DEGs increased with aging (Log foldchange ≥ |1| and FDR < 0.05), and individuals of 60-69 year old (yo) presented the highest number
of DEGs, in comparison to young adults (20-20 yo) (Figures S1-S2, Table S1). Clustering of these
DEGs identified age-associated profiles (Figure 1a). Among the transcripts translated into proteins
predicted as interacting with SARS-CoV, the hyaluronan and proteoglycan link protein 2 (HAPLN2)
increased with aging, while tribbles homolog 3 (TRIB3) decreased (Figure 1b, Table S2). HAPLN2
was predicted to interact with virus proteins spike glycoprotein and E2 glycoprotein precursors,
while TRIB3 with nucleocapsid protein and RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (Figure 1b; Table
S3). Importantly, the SARS-CoV-2 nucleocapsid protein has a sequence identity of 89.6% compared
to SARS-CoV9. The expression of TRIB3 also decreased in the lung, specifically in males with ≥ 40
years (Figure 1c), in a cohort with additional samples (GTEx, release V8).

The reanalysis of lung single-cell RNA sequencing data

19,20

demonstrated TRIB3 expressed mainly

in alveolar type I (AT1) and type II (AT2) cells and in ciliated cells (Figure 1d-f, Figure S3), which
also express SARS-CoV-2 receptor ACE27,8,21. The involvement of TRIB3 in viral infection is
poorly understood; however, its inhibition was associated with an increase of hepatitis C virus
(HCV) replication22. Additionally, TRIB3 negatively regulates the entry step of the HCV life cycle
and propagation22 and thus may constitute a common protective host factor for other positive-sense
single-strand RNA viruses. TRIB3 is also one of the unfolded protein response (UPR)-related genes
with the strongest positive correlation with the intracellular abundance of the flavivirus dengue and
Zika23. Considering the need for drugs to treat COVID-19, the α-hydroxylinoleic acid (ABTL0812)
induces the expression of TRIB3 by inhibiting the PI3K/AKT/mTOR axis and promoting autophagy
cell death in cancer24. We highlight that the lifecycle of coronaviruses depends on several host-cell
encoded cellular pathways, and among these pathways, UPR and autophagy pathways of the host
cells are essential to the life cycle of coronaviruses25.
Finally, we compared SARS-CoV-induced perturbations in host gene expression, from public Gene
Expression Omnibus (GEO) datasets, with our list of DEGs in GTEx lung samples during aging
(Figure 2, Table S8). We found that genes that decrease their expression with aging and genes that
are up-regulated with SARS-CoV infections generated the most significant network, with overrepresented genes associated with mitotic cell cycle and surfactant metabolism (Figure 2). The
decreased capacity of cellular division on aging is associated with cellular senescence - a mechanism
that stops cells with damaged DNA from replicating26 - and progenitor cell exhaustion27. The altered
metabolism or secretion of surfactants by AT2 cells reduces the ability of the lungs to expand and
increases the risk of lung collapse in HCoVs infections28,29. Moreover, Sftpc-/- (Surfactant Protein C)
mice have worse viral infections than controls30, and its human homolog decreased with aging while
it is up-regulated on SARS-CoV infections (Figure 2). Thus, the pneumonia-like lung injury found
on severe cases of COVID-19 infections5,6 may be aggravated by impaired lung regeneration and
altered metabolism of surfactants in older male patients.
Although the genes and pathways we highlighted here were identified based on a robust statistical
significance, we emphasize that other methods of over-time gene expression analyses applying
different cutoffs could be considered; using GTEx V8 cohort or separating males and females may
result in different sets of age-related genes in the lung. Further analyses should be conducted to
identify more functional differences between male and female lungs during aging. Moreover, clinical
data from these individuals - such as diabetes or heart disease - important factors influencing

COVID-19 outcome - were not evaluated. However, due to the nature of GTEx donor consent, public
phenotypes (including clinical data) are limited. Access to the protected phenotypes of the
individuals needs an application via dbGaP (Genotypes and Phenotypes database), which, associated
with reanalysis of the transcriptomics data, may take a significant amount of time. Part of the results
presented herein derives from a previously unpublished paper focusing on aging lung on a different
topic. Nevertheless, we decided to release this data focusing on SARS-CoV-2, due to the emergency
of the current pandemic.
In conclusion, we show that lung gene expression of TRIB3, a protein predicted to interact with the
nucleocapsid protein and the RNA-dependent RNA polymerase of HCoVs, decreases specifically in
males during aging. This study provides insights into aging and COVID-19 based on the
transcriptional profile of the aging lung and reveals a potential role for TRIB3, surfactant
metabolism, and mitotic cell cycle. Considering that TRIB3 may decrease virus infection and
replication, strategies to stimulate TRIB3 expression should be tested for the treatment of COVID19.

Methods
Genes differentially expressed in GTEx lung samples during aging
The RNA-Seq data analysis of lung tissues was performed using 427 samples from males and
females available at the GTEx portal (release V7) (https://www.gtexportal.org/)31. We first used the
BioJupies platform (https://amp.pharm.mssm.edu/biojupies/)32 to identify the differentially expressed
genes (DEG) in lung samples during aging. The expression data of each subject was distributed
according to their age range: 30-39; 40-49; 50-59; 60-69 and 70-79 years old (yo), and each age
range was compared with the group of young adults (20-29 yo) as a common control (Data S1,
Supplementary Table S9. Genes with Log2 of fold change ≥ |1| and false discovery rate ( FDR) <
0.05 were considered as differentially expressed (DEGs).

Next, we performed a hierarchical clustering analysis based on Pearson correlation for age ranges
using the mean expression (Trimmed Mean of M-values, TMM) of the DEGs found previously in, at
least, one age range. This analysis aimed at the identification of clusters with gradients of gene
expression across age ranges, showing increased or decreased expression during aging (method
adapted from Theunissen et al., 201133). The clusterization of gene expression profiles on female
lung samples generated clusters with less evident gradients compared to the males (Figure 1a and
Figure S4). Thus, considering the clear clusterization found in males, and the fact that older males
seem to have a worse prognosis on COVID-196, we focused on male profiles to identify age-related
lung genes.
Our research group previously used the strategy described above to analyze RNA-Seq data of GTEx
lung samples (release V7) during aging. We reutilized these results due to the urgency of the current
pandemic situation (see limitations section). With the availability of the last release of the GTEx
dataset (release V8), which presents a higher number of lung samples with transcriptomic data from
individuals of both sexes (Table S10), we used this last available cohort (V8) for further genespecific analyses. The expression of HAPLN2 and TRIB3 (TMM normalized; V8 cohort) were
compared using One-way ANOVA followed by Dunnett’s multiple comparisons test, with the
GraphPad Prism version 6.00 for Windows (GraphPad Software, La Jolla, California, USA).
Differences with a P-value < 0.05 were considered significant.
Predicted virus-host protein-protein interactions based on lung genes that increase or decrease
expression during aging and SARS-CoV-induced perturbations
The conserved evolutionary relationship between the 2019 novel SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV9
opens up the possibility to explore the relationships of these human coronaviruses (HCoVs) in
publicly available databases. Thus, we compared the list of DEG in the lung during aging with
corresponding human proteins that potentially interact with HCoVs (Table S2). The HCoVs-human
PPIs were obtained using data from the Pathogen–Host Interactome Prediction using Structure
Similarity (P-HIPSTer, http://phipster.org/) database, which is a comprehensive catalog of the virus–
human PPIs predicted based on protein structural information11 (Table S2). P-HIPSTer has an
experimental validation rate of ∼76%11. We also compared the list of DEG with recently added
libraries for virus perturbations (up- and down-regulation) from GEO datasets (GSE33266,
GSE50000, GSE49262, GSE50878, GSE49263, GSE40824, GSE50878, GSE49263, GSE47960,
GSE47961, GSE47962, GSE17400, and GSE40824), available at the EnrichR database34. Access in
March 2020. Genes that are common in either direction of both conditions were analyzed on
STRING (https://string-db.org/) 35. Access in March 2020.
Single-cell analysis of human lung datasets
We analyzed the expression of TRIB3, HAPLN2, and ACE2, in different lung cell populations by
using two previously published human single-cell RNA-seq data (Table S4)19,20. The first dataset20
was explored in the UCSC Cell Browser (http://nupulmonary.org/resources/), aiming the
identification of the cell populations expressing those genes. The samples with pulmonary fibrosis
presented in this dataset were omitted from our analysis, and only non-diseased lung samples were
included (n=8). We further used an independent single-cell RNA-seq dataset19 (n=5), available at the

Human Cell Atlas Portal (https://data.humancellatlas.org/explore/projects/c4077b3c-5c98-4d26a614-246d12c2e5d7), to confirm that expression TRIB3 and ACE2 are expressed in alveolar
epithelial cells (types 1 and 2) and in ciliate cells. Access in March 2020.
Protein-Protein Interactions (PPI) networks based on lung genes that increase or decrease
expression during aging
The corresponding proteins of the DEG shared with the list of DEG from libraries for virus
perturbations were queried in the STRING database (Search Tool for Retrieval of Interacting Genes,
version 10.5; https://string-db.org/)35, for the construction of PPI networks. We considered the
following settings: text mining, experiments, databases, and co-expression as sources of active
interaction. We selected the minimum interaction score of 0.900 (highest confidence), and the
disconnected nodes were hidden to simplify the display. We evaluated the PPI enrichment P-values,
which verifies the number of interactions of a set of proteins compared with a random set of similar
size. The PPI enrichment P-value represents the statistical significance provided by STRING. Access
in March 2020.
Data representation and analysis
The clustering analyses of the expression profiles were performed using the web tool Morpheus
(https://software.broadinstitute.org/morpheus)36. Venn diagrams were plotted using the Jvenn online
tool (https://jvenn.toulouse.inra.fr)37. Volcano Plots were constructed using the web tool:

Figure S1. Volcano plot showing lung transcriptional deregulation in 286 GTEx male samples
during aging, represented as −log10 (adjusted p-value) and log fold change difference. Dashed lines
represent our cutoffs (LogFC ≥ |1| and FDR<0.05). The differentially expressed genes (DEG) with
age were identified by distributing the expression data of each individual into five age groups (30-39;
40-49; 50-59; 60-69 and 70-79 years old) and compared with a group of young individuals (20-29
years old). Number of men: 20-29 yo (n = 16), 30-39 yo (n = 21), 40-49 yo (n = 47), 50-59 yo (n =
109), 60-69 yo (n = 86), 70-79 yo (n = 7). Number of women: 20-29 yo (n = 11), 30-39 yo (n = 9),
40-49 yo (n = 29), 50-59 yo (n = 36), 60-69 yo (n = 53), 70-79 yo (n = 3). 7 genes were up regulated
on 40-49 yo, 56 on 50-59 yo, 217 on 60-69 yo, and 144 on 70-79 yo. 11 genes were down regulated
on 50-59 yo, 179 on 60-69 yo, and 291 on 70-79.

human samples in a t-distributed Stochastic Neighbor Embedding (tSNE) plot, as described
previously 20. Grey dots represent single-cells from pulmonary fibrosis samples that were not
included in the present analysis. Single-cell gene expression of TRIB3 (B), HAPLN2 (C), and ACE2
(D) in different cell populations of the lung. The images were generated using the dataset 20,
available at nupulmonary.org/resources/. The range represents the minimum and maximum
expression.
Figure S3. Heatmap with the mean expression of DEGs on female samples (n=129), normalized by
the Trimmed Mean of M-values (TMM) and Z-scored by row. Fewer genes clustered on gradients
compared with males (Figure 1), which could mean a more substantial noise on the data due to
decreased sample size or female hormonal cycle.
