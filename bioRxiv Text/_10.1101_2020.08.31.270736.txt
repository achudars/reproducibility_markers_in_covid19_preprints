SUMMARY
Diabetes is associated with increased mortality from Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome
Coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2). Given literature suggesting a potential association between
SARS-CoV-2 infection and diabetes induction, we examined pancreatic expression of the key
molecule for SARS-CoV-2 infection of cells, angiotensin-converting enzyme-2 (ACE2).
Specifically, we analyzed five public scRNAseq pancreas datasets and performed fluorescence
in situ hybridization, Western blotting, and immunolocalization for ACE2 with extensive reagent
validation on normal human pancreatic tissues across the lifespan, as well as those from
coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) patients. These in silico and ex vivo analyses
demonstrated pancreatic expression of ACE2 is prominent in pancreatic ductal epithelium and
the microvasculature, with rare endocrine cell expression of this molecule. Pancreata from
COVID-19 patients demonstrated multiple thrombotic lesions with SARS-CoV-2 nucleocapsid
protein expression primarily limited to ducts. SARS-CoV-2 infection of pancreatic endocrine
cells, via ACE2, appears an unlikely central pathogenic feature of COVID-19 as it relates to
diabetes.

INTRODUCTION
The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic caused by Severe Acute Respiratory
Syndrome-Coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) has created a global healthcare crisis (Mercatelli and
Giorgi, 2020). With infections continuing to rise in many countries and the potential for
continuing viral persistence in the absence of a vaccine, there is an urgent need to better
understand SARS-CoV-2-mediated pathology. Key to this are efforts examining human tissues
potentially susceptible to infection.
While initial reports primarily focused on pulmonary and cardiovascular manifestations,
other organs including the kidney, brain and intestines, as well as the pancreas, have since
been noted as affected by this disorder’s pathophysiology (Connors and Levy, 2020; Fox et al.,
2020; Hanley et al., 2020; Lee et al., 2020b; Liu et al., 2020; Menter et al., 2020; Rapkiewicz et
al., 2020; Varga et al., 2020; Wang et al., 2020; Wichmann et al., 2020). Indeed, recent reports
have raised the question of whether SARS-CoV-2 might infect the pancreas and possibly
potentiate or exacerbate diabetes in either of its predominant forms, type 1 or type 2 diabetes
(i.e., T1D or T2D, respectively). These studies noted elevated serum levels of the exocrine
pancreatic enzymes, amylase and lipase, as well as development or worsening of
hyperglycemia in SARS-CoV-2 positive individuals (Wang et al., 2020), high prevalence of
diabetic ketoacidosis in hospitalized COVID-19 patients (Goldman et al., 2020; Li et al., 2020),
increased COVID-19 mortality in patients with T1D and T2D (Barron et al., 2020; Holman et al.,
2020), increased incidence of new-onset T1D in specific geographic clusters (Unsworth et al.,
2020), case reports linking the timing of T1D onset to COVID-19 (Marchand et al., 2020), and
pancreatic expression of angiotensin-converting enzyme-2 (ACE2), through which SARS-CoV-2
gains access to cells (Chen and Hao, 2020), potentially including in insulin-producing β-cells
(Lee et al., 2020b; Yang et al., 2020). These reports have collectively led to the hypothesis that
SARS-CoV-2 expression in β-cells may potentiate or exacerbate T1D or T2D. However, ACE2
expression in the human pancreas is only partially characterized, with conflicting results in both

the endocrine and exocrine compartments (Fignani et al., 2020; Hikmet et al., 2020; Lee et al.,
2020b; Yang et al., 2010; Yang et al., 2020). Indeed, the most cited report (Yang et al., 2010)
utilized a single reagent (e.g., anti-ACE2 antibody), was limited in number of tissue
samples/cases, and lacked reagent validation.
To better understand the potential impact of SARS-CoV-2 on diabetes, we carried out an
extensive investigation of the human pancreas, with particular focus on its endocrine
component, the islet of Langerhans. Specifically, we performed an integration-analysis of
publicly available single cell RNA sequencing (scRNAseq) data from isolated human islets, and
coupled these findings with direct visualization of gene and protein expression for ACE2 using
single

(smFISH),

immunohistochemistry (IHC), and multicolor immunofluorescence (IF) in human tissue.
Importantly, we employed four commercially available ACE2 antibodies and included validation
studies by IHC and immunoblot using known ACE2 positive tissues. Finally, we analyzed
SARS-CoV-2 nucleocapsid protein (NP) expression in autopsy-derived tissues from deceased
COVID-19 patients to assess whether the virus was detected in pancreatic islet endocrine cells.

RESULTS AND DISCUSSION
Low ACE2 and TMPRSS2 Gene Expression in Human Pancreatic Endocrine Cells
Diabetes, obesity, and advanced age increase the risk of COVID-19 mortality (Zhou et al.,
2020). Autopsy studies of SARS-CoV-2 infected individuals demonstrate systemic viral
dissemination with persistence in multiple organs including lungs and kidneys (Hanley et al.,
2020; Liu et al., 2020; Menter et al., 2020; Wichmann et al., 2020). Autopsy studies of pancreas
have been limited, likely due to challenges related to its post-mortem autolysis and presumed
limited clinical significance for COVID-19. However, recent studies (Barron et al., 2020; Fignani
et al., 2020; Goldman et al., 2020; Holman et al., 2020; Li et al., 2020; Marchand et al., 2020;
Unsworth et al., 2020; Wang et al., 2020) spurred interest in ACE2 expression in the pancreas,
particularly the endocrine compartment, to address a potential relationship between diabetes
and COVID-19.
SARS-CoV-2 entry into cells via ACE2 can be facilitated by the mucosal serine
proteases, TMPRSS2 and TMPRSS4 (Lee et al., 2020b; Zang et al., 2020). Therefore, we
investigated expression patterns of these molecules in isolated human islets by conducting an
integrated analysis of scRNAseq data from five datasets including 22 non-diabetic and 8 T2D
individuals (Baron et al., 2016; Grün et al., 2016; Lawlor et al., 2017; Muraro et al., 2016;
Segerstolpe et al., 2016). This analysis revealed low frequency of ACE2 expressing cells and
low ACE2 expression levels in the majority of islet cell subsets (Fig. 1A,B). In non-diabetic
donors, ACE2 was expressed in <2% of endocrine, endothelial, and immune cells. ACE2 was
detectable in 4.11% of acinar cells and 5.54% of ductal cells in non-diabetic donors and 8.07%
of acinar and 8.13% of ductal cells in donors with T2D (Table S1). Expression levels of ACE2
were not different between non-diabetic donors and donors with T2D in any of the islet cell
subtypes. TMPRSS2 was detectable in 53.73% of acinar and 50.55% of ductal cells in nondiabetic donors, and 71.43% of acinar and 58.74% of ductal cells in donors with T2D (Table
S1). Apart from α-cells, which demonstrated 16.55% positivity in non-diabetic donors,
5

TMPRSS2 expression was low in the majority of endocrine cell subsets (Fig. 1C). TMPRSS2
showed higher relative expression levels in ductal and acinar cells compared to β-cells
(adjusted P = 1.31ൈ10-291 and P < 1ൈ10-300, respectively), and was detectable in an elevated
proportion of these cells in non-diabetic donors (P < 0.05) (Fig. 1D). Neither ACE2 nor
TMPRSS2 expression differed significantly in β-cells from non-diabetic versus T2D donors (Fig.
S1A,B).
We also investigated expression patterns for other SARS-CoV-2 associated genes,
including TMPRSS4, TMPRSS11D, CTSL and ADAM17 (Table S1 and Fig. S1C-H). Similar to
TMPRSS2, TMPRSS4 expression was enriched in acinar and ductal cells. While TMPRSS4
was expressed in a similar proportion of α- and β-cells, relative expression levels tended to be
low in the endocrine pancreas (Fig. S1C-D). CTSL and ADAM17 were detected at higher levels
in α- and β-cells (Fig. S1E-F), while TMPRSS11D expression was low in most cell types
examined (Fig. S1G). Within the β-cells, only CTSL showed higher expression in donors with
T2D compared to donors without diabetes (adjusted P = 8.94ൈ 10-32, Fig. S1H).
To directly visualize TMPRSS2 or ACE2 mRNA expression patterns, we used smFISH
to analyze non-diabetic, SARS-CoV-2 negative, “normal” human pancreata from six donors
across a wide age-span (Table S2 and Fig. 1E-G) with duodenum, ileum, and kidney used as
positive controls (Fig. S2A). Results from smFISH were consistent with scRNAseq analyses.
Specifically, ACE2 mRNA was observed at low frequency in the pancreas, its signal mostly
localized to acinar, ductal and CD34+ endothelial cells (Fig. 1E-F). TMPRSS2 showed a similar
pattern but was expressed at higher frequency. Finally, in the islets, we observed limited
expression of TMPRSS2 or ACE2 in insulin positive β-cells (Fig. 1G).

Information regarding ACE2 protein expression in pancreatic tissue sections remains limited
and unfortunately contradictory. A 2010 study on SARS-CoV and its relationship with diabetes
interrogated ACE2 expression in a single donor (43 years of age), with an unspecified antibody,
and reported weak ACE2 staining in exocrine tissues but pronounced expression in pancreatic
islets (Yang et al., 2010). A recent preprint (Fignani et al., 2020) described heterogenous ACE2
expression across donors, pancreatic lobes and islets, and identified three main ACE2expressing cell types in formalin fixed, paraffin embedded (FFPE) pancreatic sections from
seven donors (aged 22-59 years) probed with a single ACE2 antibody (MAB933): endothelial
cells/pericytes, ductal cells, and in an analysis of 128 islets, β-cells that often presented with a
granular staining pattern, partially overlapping with insulin. In contrast, an analysis of tissue
microarrays containing pancreatic FFPE sections from 10 donors (aged 30-79 years) utilizing
two ACE2 antibodies (MAB933 and HPA000288) reported ACE2 expression restricted to
endothelial cells/pericytes and interlobular ducts while ACE2 was not detectable in islets, acinar
glandular cells, intercalated ducts, or intralobular ducts (Hikmet et al., 2020). This study,
together with a preprint employing six ACE2 antibodies (Lee et al., 2020a), is noteworthy for the
broad range of major human tissues and organs investigated as well as the delineation of
mostly shared but also, some distinctive ACE2 antibody staining properties. In light of these
diverging observations, it is imperative to utilize multiple ACE2 antibodies on larger donor
cohorts to gather a comprehensive description of ACE2 expression in the pancreas.
We selected four widely referenced, commercially available antibodies recognizing
specific epitopes of ACE2 (Fig. 2A), to evaluate by immunoblot (Fig. 2B and Fig. S2B-C) using
protein extracts from three non-diabetic, SARS-CoV-2 negative, “normal” pancreas donors
(Table S2). ACE2 is an 805 amino acid protein (UniProt Q9BYF1) with a theoretical molecular
mass of 94.2 kDa but an actual mass of ~120 kDa due to glycosylation at N-terminus sites
(Tipnis et al., 2000). Accordingly, a pronounced ~120kDa band was readily visualized by AF933
and ab108252 while ab15348 and especially MAB933 revealed a much weaker band (Fig. 2B

and Fig. S2B). In our hands, all four antibodies demonstrated robust and essentially
commensurate staining in human duodenum and kidney FFPE sections (Fig. S2D), consistent
with (Hikmet et al., 2020; Lee et al., 2020a).
We next visualized ACE2 via chromogen-based IHC in FFPE pancreata from nondiabetic, SARS-CoV-2 negative “normal” donors using all four antibodies and consistently
observed positive staining in the microvasculature and ductal epithelium (Fig. 2C). To further
validate specificity, we utilized a peptide-blocking assay wherein ab108252 was pre-incubated
with an ACE2 peptide prior to IHC staining (Fig. S2E). Taking Western blot and IHC validation
into account, ab108252 produced a clearly detectable 120kDa band and crisp in situ staining
that was completely blocked by pre-incubation with the ACE2 peptide. This is a monoclonal
antibody, which offers a high degree of specificity and consistency between lots. Hence, we
elected to use ab108252 in subsequent IHC and IF assays.

Human Pancreatic Expression of ACE2 Protein is Primarily Localized to Duct Epithelium
and Microvasculature Across the Lifespan
To quantitatively evaluate pancreatic ACE2 protein expression, a FFPE tissue cross-section
from each of 36 SARS-CoV-2 negative donors without diabetes (aged 0-72 years, Table S2)
was stained for insulin and ACE2 (ab108252) and scanned to produce a whole-slide image. Colocalization of ACE2 with insulin was not observed (Fig. S3A-C). The tissue area staining
positive for ACE2 was analyzed using the HALO Area Quantification algorithm (Fig. 3A).
Donors were binned into six age groups: neonate (0-0.25 years, n=6), infant/toddler (0.25-2
years, n=6), child (2-11 years, n=6), adolescent (11-15 years, n=6), young adult (20-35 years,
n=6), and senior adult (51-72 years, n=6). Collectively, these data demonstrate the percentage
of tissue staining positive for ACE2 increases steadily from birth throughout childhood, peaking
in adolescence and maintained through early adulthood, followed by a decline in persons over
50 years of age (Fig. 3B).

To more precisely visualize pancreatic ACE2 localization, we performed IF staining for
ACE2 (again using ab108252) in conjunction with insulin and glucagon (Fig. 3C-F) or with CD34
(Fig. S3D-F). Across all ages, we observed ACE2 expression in the pancreatic ductal
epithelium (Fig. 3C) but not major blood vessels (Fig. 3D), based on their morphology and
geographic positioning. ACE2 was highly expressed in microvasculature within acinar and islet
regions, with no evidence of α-cells or β-cells expressing ACE2 (Fig. 3E,F and Fig. S3). Our
data corroborate findings by one group (Hikmet et al., 2020), yet contrast with two others
(Fignani et al., 2020; Yang et al., 2010). These disparate results may be due to technical (e.g.,
antigen retrieval, reagent), material (e.g., isolated islets versus tissue sections), or donor
differences. Though one cannot definitively exclude the possibility for ACE2 protein expression
in endocrine islet cells, our analysis of 36 donors across a wide age range provides a
comprehensive view of pancreatic ACE2 localization and is independently corroborated by
scRNAseq and smFISH gene expression data (Fig. 1).

SARS-CoV-2 NP Localized to Pancreatic Ductal Epithelium from COVID-19 Patients With
and Without T2D
Following autopsy, pancreatic pathology was reviewed by hematoxylin and eosin (H&E) stained
sections in three patients with fatal COVID-19 (aged 45-72 years, Fig. 4A-C), two of whom had
a previous diagnosis of T2D (Table S3). In Patient 1, who did not have diabetes, major findings
included severe fatty replacement of acinar cell mass and moderate arteriosclerosis (Fig. 4A).
Lobules contained fibrotic centers with residual acinar cells and islets surrounding ductules (Fig.
4A insert). Islets were observed primarily within fibrotic regions. Patient 2 had moderate fatty
replacement and limited centrolobular fibrosis (Fig. 4B). Dystrophic calcification of adipocytes
was rare. Numerous islets were observed. One microthrombus was observed without adjacent
hemorrhages (Fig. 4B insert). Patient 3 showed mild to moderate arteriosclerosis with acinar
regions containing mild centrolobular fibrosis (Fig. 4C). Moderate numbers of islets were

present of varying sizes (Fig. 4C insert). None of the patients showed islet amyloidosis or acute
polymorphonuclear cell infiltrates. These histopathological findings were compatible with the
normal range of expected lesions within the exocrine compartment in pancreata from aged
patients and those with T2D.
IHC showed islets containing insulin-positive (INS+) β-cells with mostly spherical
profiles, small to medium sizes, and varying proportions of β- to α-cells in all three patients (Fig.
4D). Numerous single and clustered INS+ and glucagon-positive (GCG+) cells were observed in
ductules of fibrotic foci. The endothelium showed moderate ACE2 staining intensity within both
endocrine and exocrine compartments. The ductal epithelium showed low to moderate ACE2
staining intensity throughout the cytoplasm similar to that observed in non-diabetic pancreas
donors (Fig. 3).
IHC for SARS-CoV-2 NP was also conducted to investigate the cellular distribution of the
virus. A lung sample from a patient with COVID-19 pneumonia was used to optimize staining
conditions. Immunopositive alveolar epithelial cells and macrophages were observed with
numerous viral inclusions (Fig. S4A-B). In Patient 1 SARS-CoV-2 NP was present in some
intralobular and interlobular ductal epithelial cells shown near an islet and widely scattered
throughout the exocrine regions (Fig. 4E,F and Fig. S4C). Pancreata from Patients 2 and 3,
who had T2D, showed little to no immunopositivity for SARS-CoV-2 NP.
We believe these data provide an important foundation for considerations of pancreatic
SARS-CoV-2 infection as a potential trigger for diabetes. However, the histopathology data
presented herein do not support a causative link between the two conditions via ACE2-mediated
in vivo infection of β-cells with SARS-CoV-2. Preferential ACE2 gene and protein expression in
microvascular and ductal structures suggest these cells may constitute a more likely target for
viral infection of islets rather than endocrine cells. Indeed, based on our observations from three
COVID-19 individuals, direct SARS-CoV-2 infection of the pancreas occurred to a very limited

degree within pancreatic ductal epithelium but not islet cells, and was not associated with
polymorphonuclear infiltrations.

Limitations of Study
In theoretical conflict with our efforts, Yang et al. reported ACE2 protein expression in endocrine
cells of isolated human islets and demonstrated their susceptibility to infection with SARS-CoV2 (Yang et al., 2020). With both public scRNAseq data and our in situ smFISH experiments
documenting the presence of ACE2 mRNA in small subsets of pancreatic endocrine cells, it
remains unclear whether this forms an extremely limited basis for susceptibility to SARS-CoV-2
infection. However, it remains unknown whether the process of islet isolation may influence
endocrine cell ACE2 expression or whether viral dosage might influence their ability to undergo
SARS-CoV-2 infection ex vivo. Contrasting epidemiological reports from the United Kingdom
and Germany (Tittel et al., 2020; Unsworth et al., 2020) not only underscore the requirement for
data on diabetes incidence and SARS-CoV-2 infection rates in defined populations over time,
but also raise the need for studying pancreatic tissues from a variety of geographic populations.

on deceased COVID-19 patients. nPOD tissues are freely available to approved investigators
following successful application to the nPOD Tissue Prioritization Committee (TPC).
Data and Code Availability
This study did not generate code. Single cell sequencing data were obtained from the Gene
Expression Omnibus (GEO) Repository: GSE84133 (Baron et al., 2016), GSE81076 (Grün et
al., 2016), GSE85241 (Muraro et al., 2016), and GSE86469 (Lawlor et al., 2017), as well as

histology and additional de-identified organ donor data are available from nPOD at the nPOD
online digital pathology database and from the corresponding author upon reasonable request.

EXPERIMENTAL MODEL AND SUBJECT DETAILS
nPOD Donors and Sample Processing
Transplant-quality pancreas, duodenum, and kidney were recovered by JDRF nPOD
(www.jdrfnpod.com) from 36 COVID-19 negative organ donors without diabetes (Table S2)
according to established protocols and procedures (Campbell-Thompson et al., 2012), as
approved by the University of Florida Institutional Review Board (201400486), the United
Network for Organ Sharing (UNOS), and according to federal guidelines with informed consent

obtained from each donor’s legal representative. Organs were shipped in transport media on ice
via organ courier to the nPOD Organ Pathology and Processing Core (OPPC) at the University
of Florida where tissues were processed (Campbell-Thompson et al., 2012). Medical chart and
medical-social questionnaire reviews were performed, and T1D-associated autoantibodies
measured by ELISA (Wasserfall et al., 2016) to confirm non-diabetic health status. Donor
demographics, hospitalization duration, and organ transport time were determined from hospital
records or UNOS.
Autopsy Subjects and Sample Processing
Pancreas was recovered from three patients who tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 by reverse
transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) test within 24-48 hours of death at the
University Medical Center New Orleans (New Orleans, LA), which is equipped with an autopsy
suite that meets U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention standards for autopsy of
patients with COVID-19 (Table S3). Consent for autopsy without restriction was given by each
patient’s next of kin, and the studies within this report were determined to be exempt from
oversight by the Institutional Review Board at Louisiana State University Health Sciences
Center.

METHOD DETAIL
Single Cell RNA-sequencing (scRNAseq) Data Analysis
Five human islet scRNA-seq datasets were obtained from publicly available repositories. These
included four datasets from the Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) Repository: GSE84133
(inDrop) (Baron et al., 2016), GSE81076 (Celseq) (Grün et al., 2016), GSE85241 (CelSeq2)
(Muraro et al., 2016), and GSE86469 (Fluidigm C1) (Lawlor et al., 2017). In addition, we
analyzed an ArrayExpress database under the accession number E-MTAB-5061 (SMARTSeq2) (Segerstolpe et al., 2016). For all scRNAseq datasets, the same initial normalization was
performed: gene expression values for each cell were divided by the total number of transcripts

and multiplied by 10,000. Following log-transformation, cells were filtered that expressed fewer
than 500 genes/cell (InDrops), 1,750 genes/cell (CelSeq), or 2,500 genes/cell (CelSeq2,
Fluidigm C1, and SMART-Seq2) in accordance with the methods employed in the original
corresponding publications, leaving 14,890 cells in total for the combined analysis. Pancreatic
islet cell subtypes were identified using methods outlined in (Butler et al., 2018).
To integrate scRNAseq data, we applied canonical correlation analysis (CCA) in Seurat
v.3 (Butler et al., 2018) using “FindIntegrationAnchors” and “IntegrateData” functions. We chose
the top 2,000 variable genes from each dataset to calculate the correlation components (CCs)
and “FindClusters” was utilized for shared nearest neighbor (SNN) graph-based clustering.
Clusters were visualized with t-distributed stochastic neighbor embedding (t-SNE) by running
dimensionality reduction with “RunTSNE” and “TSNEPlot”. To compare the average gene
expression within the same cluster between cells of different samples, we applied the
AverageExpression function. Statistical analyses are further described in QUANTIFICATION
AND STATISTICAL ANALYSIS below. Violin plots (VlnPlot) were used to visualize gene
expression levels (Fig. 1A-D and Fig. S1).

Single Molecular Fluorescent In-Situ Hybridization (smFISH)
To define mRNA expression patterns of ACE2 and TMPRSS2 in human pancreata, smFISH
was performed using the RNAscope® Multiplex Fluorescent V2 kit (Advanced Cell Diagnostics,
Newark, CA) in FFPE tissue cross-sections (5μm) from six non-diabetic, SARS-CoV-2 negative
human organ donors from nPOD (Table S2, Fig. 1E-G, and Fig. S2A). Slides were baked at
60°C for 1 hour, followed by dehydration with xylene for 5 minutes x 2 and 100% ethanol for 2
minutes at room temperature (RT). Next, slides were air dried at 60°C for 5 minutes, treated
with hydrogen peroxide for 10 minutes at RT, and washed 4 times with ddH2O, followed by
antigen-retrieval at 99°C for 15 minutes. After another wash with ddH2O at RT for 15 seconds,

slides were incubated at 100% ethanol for 3 minutes, air dried and then treated with protease
plus for 30 minutes at 40°C. Next, slides were hybridized with probes for ACE2 (Advanced Cell
Diagnostics) and TMPRSS2 (Advanced Cell Diagnostics) and detected using secondary TSA
plus fluorophores (1:1500 dilution) according to the manufacture’s protocol (Perkin Elmer,
Waltham, MA). Slides were immediately washed with 1X PBS and PBS containing 2% FBS for 5
minutes, blocked with donkey serum for 30 minutes, and incubated with ready to use (RTU)
guinea pig polyclonal anti-insulin (no dilution; Agilent Santa Clara, CA) and/or mouse
monoclonal anti-CD34 antibody (1:1,000 dilution, Novus Biologicals) overnight. The following
morning, slides were washed with 1X PBS and PBS containing 2% FBS for 5 minutes and
probed using either Alexa Fluor (AF)-488 goat anti-guinea pig IgG (1:500 dilution, Invitrogen,
Carlsbad, CA) or AF-488 donkey anti-mouse IgG (1:1,000 dilution, Invitrogen) secondary
antibodies. Finally, the slides were washed with PBS, counterstained with DAPI, and mounted
with a coverslip using ProLong™ Gold antifade mounting media (Thermo Fisher, Rockford, IL).
Images were acquired using an LSM800 confocal microscope (Carl Zeiss, Germany).

Tissue Homogenization
Pancreas tissues were homogenized in modified radioimmunoprecipitation (RIPA) buffer (50
mM Tris-HCl pH 7.4, 150 mM NaCl, 5 mM EDTA, 1 mM EGTA, 1% NP-40, 0.5% sodium
deoxycholate and 0.1% SDS) with freshly prepared protease and phosphatase inhibitor
cocktails (Thermo Fisher Scientific) using a Tissue Tearor (BioSpec Inc., Bartlesville, OK). After
homogenization, tissue was further disrupted with a Vibra-Cell™ sonicator (Sonics & Materials
Inc., Newtown, CT) for 15 seconds, placed on ice for 15 minutes, then sonicated again and
placed on ice for another 15 minutes. The tissue homogenates were centrifuged at 14,000 x g
for 20 minutes at 4°C, and the supernatants were assayed for total protein concentration using a
PierceTM BCA Assay kit (Thermo Fisher Scientific) and stored at -80°C until use.

Western Blotting
Fifty micrograms of protein lysates in Laemmli’s buffer containing 2.5% β-mercaptoethanol were
boiled at 100°C for 5 minutes prior to loading into a 4-20% gradient Mini-PROTEAN TGX™
Stain-Free gel (Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA). After protein separation, gels were activated using a
Gel DOCTM EZ imager (Bio-Rad), then transferred onto nitrocellulose membranes (LI-COR
Biosciences, Lincoln, NE). Following protein transfer, membranes were scanned with the Gel
DOCTM EZ imager, and total protein staining was visualized and quantified using Image Lab
software version 5.2.1 (Bio-Rad). Then, membranes were washed and blocked for 1 hour at RT
with InterceptTM Blocking Buffer (LI-COR Biosciences). Thereafter, the membranes were
incubated at 4°C overnight with one of four primary antibodies (rabbit monoclonal anti-ACE2
(1:1,000 dilution, Abcam), rabbit polyclonal anti-ACE2 (1:500 dilution, Abcam), mouse
monoclonal anti-ACE2 (1:1,000 dilution, R&D Systems), goat polyclonal anti-ACE2 (1:500
dilution, R&D Systems)) and mouse monoclonal anti-β-actin (1:10,000 dilution; Sigma-Aldrich,
St. Louis, MO) in InterceptTM Antibody Diluent (LI-COR Biosciences). The membranes were
then washed with Tris-buffered saline containing 0.1% Tween 20 (TBST) three times at 5
minute intervals, incubated with secondary antibodies (IRDye 800CW goat anti-rabbit IgG
(1:30,000 dilution), IRDye 800CW goat anti-mouse IgG (1:30,000 dilution), IRDye 800CW
donkey anti-goat IgG (1:30,000 dilution), or IRDye 680LT donkey anti-mouse (1:40,000 dilution),
all from LI-COR Biosciences) for 1 hour at RT. The membranes were washed three times with
TBST at 5-minute intervals. Immunoreactive bands were visualized and densitometrically
analyzed using Odyssey infrared scanner and Image Studio software version 3.1 (LI-COR
Biosciences) (Fig. 2B and Fig. S2B).

Immunohistochemistry
FFPE pancreas, duodenum, and kidney tissues were sectioned (4μm), deparaffinized,
rehydrated by serially passing through changes of xylene and graded ethanol, subjected to heat

induced antigen retrieval in 10mM Citra pH 6, and blocked with avidin, biotin, and goat serum.
For single-stained kidney, duodenum, and pancreas tissue sections (Fig. 2C and Fig. S2D) and
for SARS-CoV-2 NP single stained lung and pancreas sections (Fig. 4E-F and Fig. S4), slides
were incubated overnight at 4oC with one of four primary antibodies against ACE2 (rabbit
monoclonal anti-ACE2, 1:200 dilution (Abcam); rabbit polyclonal anti-ACE2, 1:2,000 dilution
(Abcam); mouse monoclonal anti-human ACE2, 1:100 dilution, (R&D Systems); goat polyclonal
anti-ACE2, 1:100 dilution, (R&D Systems)) or a primary antibody against SARS-CoV-2 NP
(mouse monoclonal anti-SARS-CoV-2 NP, 1:50 dilution, Invitrogen). Slides were washed, then
incubated for 30 minutes at RT with biotinylated secondary antibodies (biotinylated goat antirabbit IgG, 1:200 dilution (Vector Laboratories, Burlingame, CA); biotinylated horse anti-mouse
IgG, 1:200 dilution (Vector Laboratories); biotinylated rabbit anti-goat, 1:200 dilution (Vector
Laboratories)), and developed with ImmpactDAB (Vector Laboratories) followed by hematoxylin
counterstain.
For peptide blocking experiments (Fig. S2E) the primary antibody (monoclonal rabbit
anti-ACE2, 1:100 dilution (Abcam, Cambridge, MA)) was incubated with 1mg/mL ACE2 peptide
(Abcam) for one hour at RT, before applying to pancreas slides for overnight incubation at 4oC.
Thereafter, IHC methodology was carried out as described for single stained sections.
For double- and triple-stained slides, FFPE pancreas slides were prepared for heat
induced antigen retrieval in Borg Decloaker RTU (BioCare Medical, Pacheco, CA) followed by
3% H2O2. After washing, tissues were blocked with Background Sniper (BioCare Medical)
followed by staining. For insulin and ACE2 double-staining (Fig. 3A and Fig. S3A), blocked
slides were incubated for 20 minutes at RT with the first primary antibody (rabbit monoclonal
anti-ACE2, 1:200 dilution (Abcam)), then washed and incubated with MACH 2 Double Stain Kit
1 (BioCare Medical) for 20 minutes at RT. Slides were washed and developed using DAB
Chromogen solution (BioCare Medical), then subjected to a second round of heat-induced
antigen retrieval in Borg Decloaker RTU, followed by 3% H2O2. After washing, slides were again

blocked with Background Sniper, washed, and incubated with the second primary antibody
(rabbit monoclonal anti-insulin, 1:2,000 dilution (Abcam)) for 30 minutes at RT. After washing,
slides were incubated with MACH 2 Double Stain Kit 2 for 30 minutes at RT, washed, and
developed with Warp Red Chromogen solution (BioCare Medical) followed by Hematoxylin
counterstain. For ACE2, insulin and glucagon triple-staining (Fig. 4D), blocked slides were
incubated for 20 minutes at RT with a primary antibody cocktail (mouse monoclonal antiglucagon, 1:1,000 dilution (Abcam) plus rabbit monoclonal anti-ACE2, 1:200 dilution (Abcam)),
then washed and incubated with MACH 2 Double Stain Kit 1 (BioCare Medical) for 20 minutes
at RT. Slides were washed and developed using DAB Chromogen solution for ACE2
visualization followed by Ferangi Blue Chromogen solution (BioCare Medical) for glucagon
visualization. Slides were then subjected to a second round of heat-induced antigen retrieval in
Borg Decloaker RTU, followed by 3% H2O2. After washing, slides were again blocked with
Background Sniper, washed, and incubated with the third primary antibody (rabbit monoclonal
anti-insulin, 1:2,000 dilution (Abcam)) for 30 minutes at RT. After washing, slides were
incubated with MACH 2 Double Stain Kit 2 for 30 minutes at RT, washed, and developed with
Warp Red Chromogen solution (BioCare Medical) followed by Hematoxylin counterstain.
Following single-, double-, or triple-IHC staining, whole slides were scanned at an
absolute magnification of 20x using an Aperio CS2 Scanscope (Leica/Aperio, Vista, CA), and
stored in the nPOD online digital pathology database (eSLIDE version 12.4.0.5043,
Leica/Aperio).

RT in the dark with secondary antibodies: a) goat anti-rabbit IgG-AF555, goat anti-mouse IgGAF488, and goat anti-guinea pig IgG-AF647, or b) goat anti-rabbit IgG-AF594 and goat antimouse IgG-AF488 (all from Invitrogen). Slides were washed, then counterstained with DAPI and
viewed using a Keyence BZ-X700 automated fluorescence microscope.

H&E Staining
H&E staining was performed on FFPE pancreas tissues sections (4μm) from the three COVID19 autopsy subjects according to standard methodology. Whole slides were scanned using an
Aperio CS2 Scanscope (Leica/Aperio, Vista, CA), and stored in the nPOD online digital
pathology database (eSLIDE version 12.4.0.5043, Leica/Aperio).

QUANTIFICATION AND STATISTICAL ANALYSIS
For scRNAseq analysis, n represents the number of cells as indicated in the figure legends.
Analyses were performed in R as described in METHOD DETAIL above. Differences in the
average gene expression levels between pancreatic cell subsets or within each cell subset from
non-diabetic donors versus donors with T2D were compared using Wilcoxon rank sum tests,
requiring a minimum 1.19-fold change between the two groups and expression in at least 10%
of cells from either group. Bonferroni corrections were used to adjust for multiple
comparisons. Paired t-tests were used to compare proportions of cells with detectable gene
expression. P values < 0.05 were considered significant. Violin plot limits show maxima and
minima, and the dots represent individual data points. smFISH data was not quantitatively
evaluated. For the quantification of ACE2 protein expression throughout the human lifespan,

digitized images of ACE2 and insulin co-stained slides were analyzed using the HALO
quantitative image analysis platform V3.0.311.262 (Indica Labs, Inc, Corrales, NM) (Fig. 3A).
The annotation pen tool was used to outline the tissue section to determine total tissue area
(mm2). The Area quantification algorithm v2.1.3 based on red, blue, green (RBG) spectra was
employed to detect ACE2 positive tissue area stained for 3,3’-Diaminobenzidine (DAB, brown).
The algorithm detected DAB IHC positivity and calculated percentage of ACE2 positive area per
total tissue area. Donors (n=36) were binned into six age groups as described in the Results
section. Data were analyzed in GraphPad Prism v8.3 (GraphPad Software, San Diego, CA) by
one-way ANOVA followed by Tukey’s post hoc test for multiple comparisons with significance
defined as P < 0.05 and graphed with the median percent ACE2 area shown for each group in a
box and whisker plot. The remaining IF and IHC data were not quantitatively evaluated.
