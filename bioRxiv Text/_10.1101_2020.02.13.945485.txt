Abstract

28

The ongoing outbreak of viral pneumonia in China and beyond is associated with a novel

29

coronavirus, provisionally termed 2019-nCoV. This outbreak has been tentatively associated

30

with a seafood market in Wuhan, China, where the sale of wild animals may be the source of

31

zoonotic infection. Although bats are likely reservoir hosts for 2019-nCoV, the identity of

32

any intermediate host facilitating transfer to humans is unknown. Here, we report the

33

identification of 2019-nCoV related coronaviruses in pangolins (Manis javanica) seized in

34

anti-smuggling operations in southern China. Metagenomic sequencing identified pangolin

35

associated CoVs that belong to two sub-lineages of 2019-nCoV related coronaviruses,

36

including one very closely related to 2019-nCoV in the receptor-binding domain. The

37

discovery of multiple lineages of pangolin coronavirus and their similarity to 2019-nCoV

38

suggests that pangolins should be considered as possible intermediate hosts for this novel

39

human virus and should be removed from wet markets to prevent zoonotic transmission.

Text

41

An outbreak of serious pneumonia disease was reported in Wuhan, China on 30 December

42

2019. The causative agent was soon identified as a novel coronavirus - 2019-nCoV1. Case

43

numbers grew rapidly from 27 in December 2019 to 7,818 globally as of 30 January 20202,

44

leading to the WHO to declare a public health emergency. Many of the early cases were

45

linked to Huanan seafood market in Wuhan city, Hubei province, from where the probable

46

zoonotic source is speculated to originate3. Currently, only environmental samples taken from

47

the market have been reported as positive for 2019-nCoV by the China CDC4. However, as

48

similar wet markets were already implicated in the SARS outbreak of 2002-20035, it seems

49

likely that wild animals are also involved in the emergence of 2019-nCoV. Indeed, a number

50

of non-aquatic mammals were available for purchase in the Huanan seafood market prior to

51

the outbreak4. Unfortunately, because the market was cleared soon after the outbreak began,

52

determining the source virus in the wild animals from the market is challenging. Although a

53

coronavirus closely related to 2019-nCoV sampled from a Rhinolophus affinis bat in Yunnan

54

in 2013 has now been identified6, closely related viruses have not yet been detected in other

55

wildlife species. Here, we present the identification of 2019-nCoV related viruses in

56

pangolins smuggled into southern China.

57
58

We investigated the virome composition of pangolins (mammalian order Pholidota). These

59

animals are of growing importance and interest because they are the most illegally trafficked

60

of any group of mammal: they are used as both a food source and their scales are utilized in

61

traditional Chinese medicine. A number of pangolin species now are regarded as critically

62

endangered on the International Union for Conservation of Nature Red List of Threatened

63

Species. We received frozen tissue (lungs, intestine, blood) samples that were collected from

64

18 Malayan pangolins (Manis javanica) during August 2017-January 2018. These pangolins

65

were obtained during the anti-smuggling operations by Guangxi Customs. Strikingly, high-

66

throughput sequencing of their RNA revealed the presence of coronaviruses in six (two lung,

67

two intestine, one lung-intestine mix, one blood) of 43 samples. With the sequence read data,

68

and by filling gaps with amplicon sequencing, we were able to obtain six full or nearly full

69

genome sequences - denoted GX/P1E, GX/P2V, GX/P3B, GX/P4L, GX/P5E and GX/P5L -

70

that fall into the 2019-nCoV lineage (within the genus Betacoronavirus) in a phylogenetic

71

analysis (Figure 1a). These viruses also have similar genomic organization as 2019-nCoV,

72

with nine predicted open reading frames (Figure 1b; Extended Data Table S5). We were also

73

able to successfully isolate the virus using the Vero E6 cell line (Extended Data Figure S1).

74

Based on these new genome sequences, we designed primers for qPCR detection to confirm

75

that the raw samples were positive for the coronavirus. We conducted further qPCR testing

76

on another batch of archived pangolin samples collected between May-July 2018. Among the

77

19 samples (nine intestine tissues, ten lung tissues) tested from 12 animals, three lung tissue

78

samples were coronavirus positive.

79
80

In addition to the animals from Guangxi, after the start of the 2019-nCoV outbreak the

81

Guangzhou Customs Technology Center re-examined their five archived pangolin samples

82

(two skin swabs, one unknown tissue, one scale) obtained in previous anti-smuggling

83

operations in March 2019. Following high-throughput sequencing the scale sample was

84

found to contain coronavirus reads, and from these data we were able to assemble a partial

85

genome sequence of 21,505bp (denoted as GD/P2S), representing approximately 72% of the

86

2019-nCoV genome. This virus sequence on the scale may in fact come from contaminants of

87

other infected pangolin tissues. Notably, another study of diseased pangolins in Guangdong

88

performed in 2019 also identified viral contigs from lung samples that were similarly related

89

to 2019-nCoV7. Different assembly methods and manual curation were performed to generate

90

a partial genome sequence that comprised about 86.3% of the full-length virus genome

91

(denoted as GD/P1L in the Figure 1a tree).

92
93

These novel pangolin coronavirus genomes have approximately 85.5% to 92.4% similarity to

94

2019-nCoV, and represent two sub-lineages of 2019-nCoVs in the phylogenetic tree, one of

95

which (GD/P1L and GDP2S) is extremely closely related to 2019-nCoV (Figure 1; red

96

circles). It has previously been noted that members of the subgenus Sarbecovirus have

97

experienced widespread recombination8. In support of this, a recombination analysis

98

performed here revealed that bat coronaviruses ZC45 and ZCS21 are likely recombinants,

99

containing genome fragments from multiple SARS-CoV related lineages (genome regions 2,

100

5, 7) and 2019-nCoV related lineages including that from pangolins (regions 1, 3, 4, 6, 8).

101
102

More notable, however, was the observation of putative recombination signals between the

103

pangolins coronaviruses, bat coronaviruses RaTG13, and human 2019-nCoV (Figure 1c, d).

104

In particular, 2019-nCoV exhibits very high sequence similarity to the Guangdong pangolin

105

coronaviruses in the receptor-binding domain (RBD; 97.4% amino acid similarity; indicated

106

by red arrow in Figure 1c and Figure 2a), even though it is most closely related to bat

107

coronavirus RaTG13 in the remainder of the viral genome. Bat CoV RaTG and the human

108

2019-nCoV have only 89.2% amino acid similarity in RBD. Indeed, the Guangdong pangolin

109

coronaviruses and 2019-nCoV possess identical amino acids at the five critical residues of the

110

RBD, whereas RaTG13 only shares one amino acid with 2019-nCoV (residue 442, human

111

SARS-CoV numbering9). Interestingly, a phylogenetic analysis of synonymous sites alone in

112

the RBD revealed that the phylogenetic position of the Guangdong pangolin is consistent

113

with that in the remainder of the viral genome, rather than being the closest relative of 2019-

114

nCoV (Figure 2b). Hence, it is possible that the amino acid similarity between the RBD of

115

the Guangdong pangolin coronaviruses and 2019-nCoV is due to selectively-mediated

116

convergent evolution rather than recombination, although it is difficult to choose between

117

these scenarios on current data. Although the drivers of any convergent evolution are

118

unknown, its possible occurrence, as well as that of recombination, would further highlight

119

the role played by intermediate animal hosts in human virus emergence.

120
121

To date, pangolins are the only mammals other than bats documented to be infected by a

122

2019-nCoV related coronavirus. It is striking that two related lineages of CoVs are found in

123

pangolins and that both are also related to 2019-nCoV. This suggests that these animals may

124

be long-term reservoir hosts for these viruses, which is surprising as pangolins are solitary

125

animals with relatively small population sizes, reflecting their endangered status10. However,

126

it cannot be excluded that pangolins acquired their 2019-nCoV related viruses independently

127

from bats or another animal host. It is also notable that both lineages of pangolin

128

coronaviruses were obtained from trafficked Malayan pangolins, likely originating from

129

Southeast Asia, and there is a marked lack of knowledge of the viral diversity maintained by

130

this animal in regions where it is indigenous. Undoubtedly, the extent of virus transmission in

131

pangolin populations requires additional investigation, but the repeated occurrence of

132

infections with 2019-nCoV related coronaviruses in Guangxi and Guangdong provinces

133

suggests that this animal may be a potentially important host in coronavirus emergence.

134
135

Coronaviruses, including those related to 2019-nCoV, are clearly present in many wild

136

mammals in Asia5,6,7,11. Although the epidemiology, pathogenicity, interspecies infectivity

137

and transmissibility of coronaviruses in pangolins remains to be studied, the data presented

138

here strongly suggests that handling these animals requires considerable caution, and that

139

their sale in wet markets should be strictly prohibited. Further surveillance on pangolins in

140

the natural environment in China and Southeast Asia are clearly needed to understand their

141

role in the emergence of 2019-nCoV and the risk of future zoonotic transmission.

Ethics Statement

144

The animals studied here were rescued and treated by the Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous

145

Region Terrestrial Wildlife Medical-aid and Monitoring Epidemic Diseases Research Center

146

under the ethics approval (wild animal treatment regulation No. [2011] 85). The samples

147

were collected following the procedure guideline (Pangolins Rescue Procedure, November,

148

2016).

150

Sample collection, viral detection and sequencing of pangolins in Guangxi

151

We received frozen tissue samples of 18 pangolins (Manis javanica) from Guangxi Medical

152

University, China, which were collected between August 2017 – January 2018. These

153

pangolins were seized by the Guangxi Customs during their routine anti-smuggling

154

operations. All animal individuals comprised samples from multiple organs including lungs,

155

intestine and blood, with the exception of six individuals for which only lung tissues were

156

available, five with mixed intestine and lung tissues only, one with intestine tissues only, and

157

one comprising two blood samples. Using the intestine-lung mixed sample we were able to

158

isolate a novel Betacoronavirus using the Vero-E6 cell line (Extended Data Figure S1). A

159

High Pure Viral RNA Kit (Roche, Switzerland) was used for RNA extraction on all 43

160

samples. For RNA sequencing, a sequencing library was constructed using an Ion Total

161

RNA-Seq Kit v2 (Thermo Fisher Scientific, MA, USA), and the library was subsequently

162

sequenced using an Ion Torrent S5 sequencer (Thermo Fisher Scientific). Reverse

163

Transcription was performed using an SuperScript III First-Strand Synthesis System for RT-

164

PCR (Thermo Fisher Scientific, MA, USA). DNA libraries were constructed using the

165

NEBNext Ultra II DNA Library Prep Kit and sequenced on a MiSeq sequencer. The NGS

166

QC Toolkit V2.3.3 was used to remove low-quality and short reads. Both BLASTn and

167

BLASTx were used to search against a local virus database, utilizing the data available at

168

NCBI/GenBank. Genome sequences were assembled using the CLC Genomic Workbench

169

v.9.0. To fill gaps in high throughput sequencing and obtain the whole viral genome

170

sequence, amplicon primers based on the bat SARS-like coronavirus ZC45 (GenBank

171

accession number MG772933) sequence were designed for amplicon-based sequencing.

172
173

A total of six samples (including the virus isolate) contained reads that matched a

174

Betacoronavirus (Extended Data Table S1). We obtained near complete genomes from these

175

samples (98%, compared to 2019-nCoV), with the virus genomes denoted as GX/P1E,

176

GX/P2V, GX/P3B, GX/P4L, GX/P5E and GX/P5L. Based on these genome sequences, we

177

designed primers for qPCR to confirm the positivity of the original tissue samples (Extended

178

Data Table S4). This revealed an original lung tissue sample that was also qPCR positive, in

179

addition to the six original samples with coronavirus reads. We further tested an addition 19

180

samples (nine intestine tissues, ten lung tissues), from 12 smuggled pangolins sampled

181

between May-July 2018 by the group from Guangxi Medical University. The genome

182

sequences of GX/P1E, GX/P2V, GX/P3B, GX/P4L, GX/P5E and GX/P5L were submitted to

183

GenBank and GISAID databases, their accession numbers will be available as soon as it is

184

generated.

185
186

Sample collection, viral detection and sequencing of pangolins in Guangdong

187

After the start of the 2019-nCoV outbreak, the Guangzhou Customs Technology Center re-

188

examined their five archived pangolin samples (two skin swabs, one unknown tissue, one

189

scale) obtained in anti-smuggling operations undertaken in March 2019. RNA was extracted

190

from all five samples (Qiagen, USA), and was subjected to high-throughput RNA sequencing

191

on the Illumina HiSeq platform by Vision medicals, Guangdong, China. The scale sample

192

was found to contain coronavirus reads using BLAST methods. These reads were quality

193

assessed, cleaned and assembled into contigs by both de novo (MEGAHIT v1.1.312) and

194

using reference (BWA v0.7.1313) assembly methods, with BetaCoV/Wuhan/WIV04/2019 as

195

reference. The contigs were combined, and approximately 72% of the coronavirus genome

196

(21,505bp) was obtained. This sequence was denoted as pangolin CoV GD/P2S.

197
198

Liu et al. recently published a meta-transcriptomic study of pangolins7 and deposited 21

199

RNA-seq raw files on the SRA database (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/sra). We screened

200

these raw read files using BLAST methods and found that five (SRR10168374,

201

SRR10168376, SRR10168377, SRR10168378 and SRR10168392) contained reads that

202

mapped to 2019-nCoV. These reads were subjected to quality assessment, cleaning and then

203

de novo assembly using MEGAHIT12 and reference assembly using BWA13. These reads

204

were then merged and curated in a pileup alignment file to obtain the consensus sequences.

205

This combined consensus sequence is 25,753bp in length (about 86.3% of

206

BetaCoV/Wuhan/WIV04/2019) and denoted pangolin CoV GD/P1L. Notably, it has 66.8%

207

overlap and only 0.21% divergence (i.e. a sequence identify of 99.79%) with the GD/P2S

208

sequence. Since their genetic difference is so low, for the recombination analysis we merged

209

the GD/P1L and GD/P2S sequences into a single consensus sequence to minimize gap

210

regions within any sequences.

211
212

The viral genome organizations of Guangxi and Guangdong pangolin coronaviruses were

213

similar to 2019-nCoV. They had a total number of 9 open reading frames (ORFs) and shared

214

the same gene order of ORF1ab replicase, envelope glycoprotein spike (S), envelope (E),

215

membrane (M), nucleocapsid (N), plus other predicted ORFs. Detailed comparison of the

216

ORF length and similarity with 2019-nCoV and bat coronavirus RaTG13 is provided in

217

Extended Table S5.

219

Sequence, phylogenetic and recombination analyses

220

The human 2019-nCoV and bat RaTG13 coronavirus genome sequences were downloaded

221

from Virological.org (http://virological.org) and the GISAID (https://www.gisaid.org)

222

databases on 17 January 2020, with the data kindly shared by the submitters (Extended Data

223

Table S2). Other coronaviruses (subgenus Sarbecovirus) were downloaded from GenBank

224

(Extended Data Table S3) and compared to those obtained here. We constructed a multiple

225

sequence alignment of their complete genomes and individual genes using MAFFT v7.27314.

226

Maximum likelihood phylogenies were estimated using PhyML v3.115, utilizing the

227

GTR+I+G model of nucleotide substitution with 1,000 bootstrap replicates. To investigate

228

potential recombination events, we implemented a window sliding approach to determine the

229

changing patterns of sequence similarity and phylogenetic clustering between the query and

230

the reference sequences, as well as a scanning of phylogenetic clusters performed directly

231

from the multiple sequence alignment. Maximum likelihood trees were estimated from each

232

window extraction (i.e. genome regions 1 to 8) using PhyML as described above.

Figure 1. Phylogenetic analyses depicting the evolutionary relationship between human

307

2019-nCoV, the pangolin coronavirus sequences obtained in this study, and the other

308

reference coronaviruses. The phylogenies were estimated using a maximum likelihood

309

approach employing the GTR+I+G nucleotide substitution model and 1,000 bootstrap

310

replicates. (A) Phylogeny of the subgenus Sarbecovirus (genus Betacoronavirus) estimated

311

from the concatenated ORF1ab-S-E-M-N genes. Red circles indicate the pangolin

312

coronavirus sequences generated in this study. Note that GD/P1L is the consensus sequence

313

re-assembled from the raw data previously published7. (B) Genome organization of

314

coronaviruses including the pangolin coronaviruses, with the predicted ORFs shown in

315

different colors. (C) Sliding window analysis of changing patterns of sequence similarity

316

between 2019-nCoV, pangolin coronaviruses and bat coronavirus RaTG13. The name of the

317

query sequences are shown vertically on the right of the analysis boxes. The similarities to

318

different reference sequences are indicated by different colors shown in the legend box at the

319

top. Guangdong pangolin coronaviruses GD/P1L and GD/P2S were merged for this analysis.

320

The blue arrows at the top indicate the position of the ORFs in the alignment analyzed. The

321

potential recombination breakpoints are shown in pink dash lines, which together slice the

322

genomes into eight regions (regions with <200bp were omitted; indicated by the red line at

323

bottom) for phylogenetic analysis. (D) Phylogenetic trees of different genomic regions.

324

SARS-CoV and 2019-nCoV related lineages are shown in blue and red tree branches. Branch

325

scale bars are 0.1 substitutions/site.

Figure 2. (A) Sequence alignment showing the receptor-binding domain (RBD) in human,

328

pangolin and bat coronaviruses. The five critical residues for binding between SARS-CoV

329

RBD and human ACE2 protein are indicated in red boxes, and ACE2-contacting residues are

330

indicated with yellow boxes, following Wan et al.9. Note that in Guangdong pangolin

331

sequence, the codon positions coding for amino acid 337 proline, 420 aspartic acid, 499

332

proline and 519 asparagine have ambiguous nucleotide compositions, resulting to possibly

333

alternative amino acids threonine, glycine, threonine and lysine respectively. GD:

334

Guangdong, GX: Guangxi. (B) Phylogenetic trees of 2019-nCoV related lineage estimated

335

from the whole RBD region (upper) and synonymous sites only (lower). Branch supports

336

obtained from 1,000 bootstrap replicates are shown.
