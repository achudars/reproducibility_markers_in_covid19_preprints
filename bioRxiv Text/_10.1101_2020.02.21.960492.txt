ABSTRACT The leopard cat (Prionailurus bengalensis) has been listed as an

27

endangered species under the Wildlife Conservation Act in Taiwan since 2009. In

28

this study, we targeted viral pathogens, included carnivore protoparvovirus 1

29

(CPPV-1), feline leukemia virus (FeLV), feline immunodeficiency virus (FIV),

30

coronavirus (CoV), and canine morbillivirus (CMV), using molecular screening. The

31

spatial and temporal dynamics of the target pathogens were evaluated. Through

32

sequencing and phylogenetic analysis, we aimed to clarify the phylogenetic

33

relationship of isolated viral pathogens between leopard cats and domestic

34

carnivores. Samples from 23 and 29 leopard cats that were live-trapped and found

35

dead, respectively, were collected from Miaoli County from 2015 to 2019 in

36

northwestern Taiwan. CPPV-1 and coronavirus were detected in leopard cats. The

37

prevalence (95% confidence interval) of CPPV-1, and CoV was 63.5% (50.4%–76.6%)

38

and 8.8% (0%–18.4%), respectively. The majority of sequences of each CPPV-1

39

strain amplified from Taiwanese leopard cats and domestic carnivores were

40

identical. All the amplified CoV sequences from leopard cats were identified as

41

feline coronavirus. The spatial and temporal aggregation of CPPV-1 infection in

42

leopard cats was not determined in the sampling area, which indicated a wide

43

distribution of CPPV-1 in the leopard cat habitat. We consider sympatric domestic

44

carnivores to be the probable primary reservoir for the pathogens identified. We

strongly recommend establishing efforts to manage CPPV-1 and FCoV in the

IMPORTANCE The leopard cat (Prionailurus bengalensis) is an endangered

50

species in Taiwan. The effects of infectious diseases on the wildlife population have

51

increasingly been recognized. In this study, we targeted highly pathogenic viral

52

pathogens in wild cat species, included carnivore protoparvovirus 1 (CPPV-1), feline

53

leukemia virus (FeLV), feline immunodeficiency virus (FIV), coronavirus (CoV),

54

and canine morbillivirus (CMV), using molecular screening. Furthermore, we

55

collected the epidemiological and phylogenetic data to understand the spatial and

56

temporal dynamics of the target pathogens in the wild leopard cat population and

57

identified the possible origin of target pathogens. Based on our study, we consider

58

sympatric domestic carnivores to be the probable primary reservoir for the

59

pathogens identified. Our study provides a deeper understanding related to the

60

distribution of target viral pathogens in the wild leopard cats. The information is

61

essential for leopard cat conservation and pathogen management.

INTRODUCTION

T
66

he leopard cat (Prionailurus bengalensis) is an endangered felid species that

67

is distributed in East, Southeast, and South Asia (1). It was previously

68

commonly distributed in the lowland habitats throughout the island of Taiwan (2, 3).

69

However, the Wildlife Conservation Act of Taiwan listed the leopard cat as an

70

endangered species in 2009 after an island-wide decline in the population of this

71

species (4). Currently, the distribution of Taiwanese leopard cats is restricted to

72

small areas in 3 counties in Central Taiwan, namely Miaoli, Nantou, and Taichung

73

City. Studies in Miaoli County suggested that road traffic, habitat fragmentation and

74

degradation, illegal trapping, and poisoning are the principal threats to the

75

sustainability of the leopard cat population (5). However, the possible direct or

76

indirect effects of pathogens on the population of Taiwanese leopard cats have never

77

been evaluated. Moreover, information related to infectious agents distributed in the

78

wild Taiwanese leopard cat population has remained scarce. Our previous study

79

documented the distribution of carnivore protoparvovirus 1 in Taiwanese leopard

80

cats and its association with domestic carnivores (6). To our knowledge, this was the

81

only study on infectious agents in free-living leopard cats in Taiwan. The effects of

82

infectious diseases on the wildlife population have increasingly been recognized (7,

83

8). Conspicuous illness or the mass die-off of wild animals caused by specific agents

84

are easier to identify and are usually considered a threat to the abundance of wildlife

85

populations. Although unremarkable or sublethal diseases in wild animals are

86

difficult to identify, such diseases may reduce the fitness of wild animals through an

87

increased energy output or decreased food ingestion, arresting the growth of the

88

population substantially (7, 9).

89

Pathogen infection in wild felids has been documented worldwide with different

90

degrees of importance. Viral pathogens that have been identified in wild or captive

91

leopard cats include feline immunodeficiency virus (FIV) (10), carnivore

92

protoparvovirus 1 (CPPV-1) (6, 11, 12), feline herpesvirus type 1 (FHV-1) (11), and

93

feline calicivirus (FCV) (11). Furthermore, studies have recorded infection by

94

bacterial and parasitic agents including Anaplasma (13, 14), hemoplasma (13, 15),

95

Hepatozoon felis (16–18), and several helminths (19). Although the effects of the

96

recorded infectious agents on leopard cats remain unclear, identifying infectious

97

agents in the leopard cat population is essential for disease management and species

98

conservation.

99

Our previous study recorded carnivore protoparvovirus 1 (CPPV-1) infection in

100

free-living leopard cats, albeit with a limited sample size. In the present study, we

101

extended the target of viral pathogens for screening using a larger sample size. The

102

target viral pathogens were CPPV-1, feline leukemia virus (FeLV), FIV, coronavirus

(CoV), and canine morbillivirus (CMV).

104

Our objective was to identify the infection of selected viral pathogens based on

105

molecular screening. The spatial and temporal distribution of target pathogens was

106

described. Furthermore, through sequencing and phylogenetic analysis, we aimed to

107

clarify the phylogenetic relationship of isolated viral pathogens between leopard cats

108

and domestic carnivores.

MATERIALS AND METHODS

Study area. All the leopard cats samples were collected from Miaoli County in

112

northwestern Taiwan (Fig. 1). The sampling area has a hilly landscape with an

113

elevation of less than 320 m above sea level. The total area of Miaoli County is 1820

114

km2, consisting of 1245.3 km2 of forests (68.8%), 291.2 km2 of agricultural land

115

(16.1%), and 132.6 km2 of human construction (7.3%). A well-developed road

116

system, which includes a primary road (approximately 25 m wide), secondary roads

117

(approximately 10 m wide), and tertiary roads (approximately 5 m wide), and human

118

encroachment have fragmented the wildlife habitat in this rural area. The Taiwanese

119

leopard cat population was primarily distributed in the west half of Miaoli County

120

(20).

not available, they were commonly observed and were sympatric with the leopard

123

cats in the study area (20).

125

Sample collection. The leopard cat samples were collected from January 2015

126

to April 2019. Free-living leopard cats were trapped for radio telemetry tracking or

127

relocation of leopard cats that invaded poultry farms. Permission for conducting this

128

study was issued by the Forest Bureau (Permit no.: COA, Forestry Bureau,

129

1061702029, 1081603388). Steel-mesh box traps (108-Rigid Trap, Tomahawk Live

130

Trap, LLC., Hazelhurst, Wisconsin, USA) baited with live quails were employed for

131

trapping the leopard cats. The trapped leopard cats were anesthetized by

132

veterinarians using a mixture of dexmedetomidine hydrochloride (100 µg/kg) and

133

tiletamine HCl/zolazepam HCl (2 mg/kg). The procedures for leopard cat trapping,

134

anesthesia administration, and sample collection were approved by the Institutional

135

Animal Care and Use Committee of National Pingtung University of Science and

136

Technology (Approval no.: NPUST-106-014, NPUST-107-041).

137

The carcasses of found-dead (FD) leopard cats, with the majority of deaths

138

caused by vehicle collision, were collected and submitted by the County

139

Government of Miaoli for additional necropsy and sample collection.

of selected pathogens are displayed in Table 1.
We recorded sex and age for each leopard cat. Age classification was based on

143

guidelines from Chen et al. (6). The criteria of age classification were deciduous

144

dentition for juveniles, permanent dentition but not full growth for subadults, full

145

growth of permanent dentition to mild abrasion of canine teeth for young adults, and

146

moderate to severe abrasion of canine teeth for old adults.

Nucleic acid extraction and (RT)PCR screening for selected viral pathogens.

149

Samples were homogenized prior to nucleic acid extraction. Total DNA was

150

extracted from the collected tissues and blood samples using the DNeasy blood and

151

tissue kit and total RNA was extracted using the RNeasy minikit and QIAamp RNA

152

blood minikit (Qiagen, Valencia, CA, USA). We performed rectal swabs using the

153

QIAamp DNA stool minikit as well as the QIAamp Viral RNA minikit (Qiagen,

154

Valencia, CA, USA) to extract DNA and RNA, respectively.

155

The manufacturer’s recommended procedures were followed for nucleic acid

156

extraction. Reverse transcription of total RNA to cDNA was performed with the

157

iScript cDNA synthesis kit (Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA) following the manufacturer’s

158

instructions.

genetic divergence of pathogens in wildlife, which cannot be amplified by a specific

161

primer designed for analyzing domestic animals (21). Samples and primers selected

162

for (RT)PCR screening are listed in Table 1. The limitation of detection of (RT)PCR

163

under designed conditions for amplifying the genes of targeted infectious agents

164

ranged from 1 to 1000 gene copies/µL (Table 2).

165

The PCR amplicons of collected samples were sequenced in an ABI377

166

sequencer using an ABI PRISM dye-terminator cycle sequencing ready reaction kit

167

with Amplitaq DNA polymerase (Perkin-Elmer, Applied Biosystems). To identify

168

sequences similar to those of the amplicons, a BLAST search was performed using

169

GeneBank with the nt/nr database available on the BLAST website (BLAST;

181

Data analysis. We first estimated the prevalence of each targeted infectious

182

agent and its 95% confidence interval (CI) (32). As leopard cats are endangered, our

183

sample size was limited; thus, we did not intend to exclude the possible distribution

184

of the targeted infectious agents in the population of leopard cats if all individual

185

samples screened negative.

186

The samples from live-trapped (LT) and FD leopard cats were pooled to

187

evaluate a possible spatial or temporal cluster of target pathogens using SaTScan

188

version 9 (33) with the Bernoulli model (34).

RESULTS

Leopard cat sample collection and distribution in Miaoli County. From 2015

192

to 2019, we collected samples from 52 leopard cats, of which 23 were LT and 29

193

were FD (Table 3; Table S1). No significant difference in sex was noted between LT

194

and FD individuals (Pearson’s chi-squared test; p = 0.157). However, there were

195

significantly more adults in the FD group than in the LT group (Fisher’s exact test; p

196

= 0.0026). Samples were collected from leopard cats across western Miaoli County

197

in a landscape of fragmented secondary forest habitat surrounded by farmland and

201

Prevalence and distribution of targeted viral pathogens. For the targeted viral

202

pathogens, only CPPV-1 and coronavirus were detected in the collected samples of

203

leopard cats. The prevalences (95% CI) of CPPV-1 , FeLV, FIV, CoV, and CMV

204

were 63.5% (50.4%–76.6%), 0% (0%–6%), 0% (0%–5.9%), 8.8% (0%–18.4%), and

205

0% (0%–6.3%), respectively (Table 4). The prevalence of CPPV-1 in FD cats was

206

significantly higher than that in LT cats (Fisher’s exact test, p = 0.002). Furthermore,

207

the prevalence was significantly higher in adults than in subadults (Fisher’s exact

208

test, p = 0.01). We did not determine any difference in prevalence between the type

209

of sample, sex, and age for CoV (Table 4).

210

The spatial distribution of CPPV-1-positive individuals was scattered in the

211

west of Miaoli County. Three positive CoV samples were distributed in northwest

212

Miaoli (Fig. 2). We did not determine any spatial and temporal aggregation of

213

CPPV-1 infection in the sampling area (SaTScan, Bernoulli model, p = 0.094).

214

Spatial and temporal analyses were not performed for CoV, CMV, FeLV, and FIV,

215

because very few or no positive samples were detected.

218

of CPPV-1 was based on the VP2 amino acid sequences obtained from the 29

219

CPPV-1-positive leopard cats. We determined that 11, 7, 6, and 5 leopard cats were

220

infected with CPV-2a, CPV-2b, CPV-2c, and feline panleukopenia virus (FPV),

221

respectively (Table S2). The occurrence of CPPV-1 strain was significantly different

222

from 2015 to 2018 (Fisher’s exact test, p = 0.006), with CPV-2b occurrence

223

decreasing and CPV-2c and FPV increasing (Fig. 3).

224

Partial VP2 sequences of all CPPV-1 strains amplified from 29 leopard cats, 27

225

dogs, and 9 cats in Miaoli County and accessed from Genbank were included for

226

phylogenetic analysis (Table S3). We adopted the Tamura-Nei model to construct a

227

CPPV-1 phylogenetic tree based on the lowest BIC scores. The phylogenetic tree

228

indicated that each CPPV-1 strain amplified from leopard cats and domestic

229

carnivores from Miaoli County was primarily located in the same subcluster (Fig. 4).

230

Furthermore, the majority of sequences of each CPPV-1 strain amplified from

231

Taiwanese leopard cats and domestic carnivores were identical, comprising

232

sequence types CPV-2a/1, CPV-2b/5, CPV-2b/8, CPV-2c/3, and FPV-4 (Fig 4, Table

233

S3). However, certain sequence types were detected in leopard cats but not in

234

domestic carnivores (Fig. 4, Table S3). Most of the nucleotide mutations of different

235

CPPV-1 variants amplified from leopard cats were synonyms, which did not change

236

the encoded amino acid (Fig 4; Table S2). Nonsynonymous mutations of sequence

types amplified from leopard cats were determined in CPV-2a/3 with P352L and

238

P356S substitution, CPV-2b/7 with S339N substitution, CPV-2c/5 with G437E

239

substitution, FPV/5 with A379V substitution, and FPV/6 with Q310L, A334T,

240

R377K, or R382K substitution.

241

Phylogenetic analysis of the 3 sequences amplified from the RNA-dependent

242

DNA polymerase (RdRP) gene of CoV from leopard cats was first performed using

243

the Tamura 3-parameter model with discrete Gamma distribution. The phylogenetic

244

tree indicated that all the amplified CoV sequences from leopard cats were located in

245

a cluster of viral species, Alphacoronavirus 1, and a feline coronavirus subcluster

246

(Fig. 5).

247

248

DISCUSSION

249

In this study, we screened the selected viral pathogens using (RT)PCR and

250

determined the distribution of CPPV-1 and CoV in free-living leopard cats.

251

Phylogenetic analysis revealed that the majority of identical genetic types of

252

CPPV-1 strains were circulated between leopard cats and domestic carnivores;

253

however, unique genetic types were identified in leopard cats. On the basis of the

254

sequences of the RdRp gene, all the amplified CoV strains were identified as strains

255

of feline coronavirus (FCoV) in species of Alphacoronavirus 1.

256

To our knowledge, CPPV-1 and FCoV infection in free-living leopard cats has

257

only been reported in Taiwan (6), although CPPV-1 infection has been previously

258

reported in captive leopard cats from Taiwan and Vietnam (11, 12). The worldwide

259

distribution of CPPV-1 has resulted in the infection of various wild carnivorous

260

species (22, 35–38). Mech et al. (38) determined that CPPV-1 contributed to a 40%

261

to 60% reduction in wolf pup survival and impeded the population growth rate.

262

Disease induced by CPPV-1 infection was commonly found in the juvenile or

263

subadult individuals of domestic carnivores. However, adult individuals with severe

264

clinical signs of CPPV-1 infection were recorded (39–41). Studies are increasingly

265

reporting severe CPPV-1 enteritis in adult dogs (40, 42). Furthermore, a higher risk

266

of developing chronic gastrointestinal disease had been determined in dogs after

267

CPPV-1 infection (43). However, we observed a higher prevalence of CPPV-1 in FD

268

and adults. A higher prevalence may represent a higher risk of infection or lower

269

mortality. Prevalence data alone are not sufficient to evaluate the effect of CPPV-1

270

on different sample types or age categories. Therefore information regarding the

271

physical effects, pathological changes, and mortality caused by CPPV-1 is required.

FCoV infection has been documented in various domestic and wild felids (44–

273

47). The infection can be asymptomatic or associated with a fatal systematic disease,

274

feline infectious peritonitis (FIP), and enteric disease (48, 49). Mochizuki et al. (50)

275

screened serum antibodies of 17 iriomote cats (Prionailurus bengalensis

276

iriomotensis), a subspecies of leopard cats, for coronavirus and found a prevalence

277

of 82%. This study indicated frequent exposure to and transmission of FCoV in

278

leopard cats. Although FCoV is commonly detected in wild felids worldwide, only a

279

few species, such as cheetahs (Acinoyx jubatus), have been reported to exhibit FIP

280

(44, 46, 48). In our study, 2 out of 3 positive samples were from FD cats and 1 was

281

from an LT cat. We did not determine any pathological changes or clinical signs

282

related to FCoV. Nevertheless, felids infected with FCoV that display no evidence of

283

disease are considered to be chronic carriers that may increase other felids’ risk of

284

contracting FIP (45, 49).

285

In this study, the effects of CPPV-1 and FCoV on individuals or the population

286

of these leopard cats were not evaluated. However, based on the documented effects

287

and cases of CPPV-1 and FCoV on wild felids, the effect of CPPV-1 and FCoV on

288

leopard cats should not be overlooked, and continuous surveillance will be required.

289

Moreover, the spatial aggregation of CPPV-1 infection in leopard cats was not

290

determined in the sampling area, which indicated a wide distribution of CPPV-1 in

291

the habitat of leopard cats. CPPV-1 is stable in the environment and infectiousness

292

can be maintained for several months (35). Free-roaming domestic carnivores are

293

commonly observed in the sampling area, which is an active area with

294

well-developed road systems (51, 52). Although the sample size was small, we

295

found a very high prevalence of CPPV-1 (90%; n = 10; data not shown) in

296

free-roaming dogs and cats in our sampling area. These conditions aggravate the

297

transmission and distribution of CPPV-1 in the leopard cat habitat. Future studies

298

should evaluate the influence of domestic carnivores on the transmission of CPPV-1

299

in the habitat.

300

In addition to pathogen surveillance, application of molecular analysis

301

techniques for pathogens has been suggested for investigating several aspects of

302

pathogenesis (53), including pathogen characterization and pathogen transmission

303

(53). We identified the infection of 4 strains of CPPV-1 and FCoV in leopard cats

304

based on the sequences of each positive amplification for selected pathogens.

305

Temporal dynamics revealed that the infection of CPV-2c and FPV was increased,

306

whereas CPV-2b infection was decreased. The distribution of CPV-2c in Taiwan was

307

first detected in dogs in 2015 (54). Since then, CPV-2c has gradually become the

308

predominant variant of CPPV-1 in dogs (54). We first detected CPV-2c in leopard

309

cats in 2017, which indicates an original transmission direction of CPPV-1 from

310

domestic carnivores to leopard cats. Background information and surveillance data

311

for FPV are scarce. Therefore, factors that increase FPV infection rates still need to

312

be assessed.

313

Our previous study found that the majority of sequences of CPPV-1 variants

314

were identical between domestic carnivores and the leopard cats based on the partial

315

VP2 gene sequences (6), which suggested frequent transmission of CPPV-1 between

316

domestic and wild carnivores. In this study, we collected 2 times of leopard cat

317

samples and we recorded several different sequence types for each CPPV-1 variant

318

circulating in the leopard cat population (Fig. 4). However, the majority of

319

amplifications from both domestic carnivores and leopard cats belonged to a specific

320

sequence type of each variant. These results support the assumption that CPPV-1 is

321

transmitted between domestic carnivores and leopard cats. Although we identified

322

nonsynonymous mutations of sequence types from leopard cats, the causes and

323

function of amino acid substitutions were undetermined. The amplified DNA

324

sequence of CPPV-1 VP2 encoded amino acid from 300 to 437 residues (Table S2),

325

located in the GH loop, an externally exposed loop in the antigenic region with the

326

greatest variability (55). The sequence types of each variant found only in leopard

327

cats does not indicate an adoption to the leopard cat, as only a few sequences from

328

domestic carnivores in the sampling area were reported.

329

Cross-species transmission of CPPV-1 between domestic and free-living

330

carnivores has been demonstrated or suspected in several countries (35, 36). Due to

331

the critically endangered situation of leopard cats in Taiwan, sustained CPPV-1

332

transmission in this low-density population is improbable (56). We considered the

333

domestic carnivores as the primary reservoirs based on the evidence that dogs and

334

cats exhibited the highest abundance among carnivores in the study area, a high

335

prevalence of CPPV-1, and the fact that CPV-2c occurrence in domestic dogs was

336

earlier than in leopard cats.

337

In this study, we did not detect any current infection of FIV, FeLV, and CDV in

338

leopard cats. The 95% CI of prevalence for FIV, FeLV, and CDV was 0% to 5.9%,

339

0% to 6%, and 0% to 6.3%, respectively. On the basis of the long-lasting disease and

340

proviral DNA in peripheral blood monocytic cells characteristics of the FIV and

341

FeLV in Felidae, the possibility of a false negative is low. Therefore we considered a

342

low occurrence of FIV and FeLV in Taiwanese leopard cats. Studies have been

343

conducted involving serological surveys of FIV and FeLV in leopard cats in Taiwan

344

and Vietnam and did not detect any positive cases (12, 57). However, Hayama et al.

345

(10) determined a prevalence of 3% (n = 86) and 13.6% (n = 280) of FIV infection

346

in Tsushima leopard cats and domestic cats, respectively, in Kami-Shima, Tsushima

347

Island, Japan. The domestic cat was considered as the reservoir of FIV in the

348

Tsushima case (10, 58). The prevalence of FIV and FeLV varies between different

349

felids and geographic regions (59).

350

The infection of CDV has been reported in both wild and domestic felids (59,

351

60). Ikeda et al. (61) reported a captive leopard cat in Taiwan having antibodies

352

against CDV. Furthermore, a serological survey for CDV found a prevalence of

353

77.8% in wild Taiwanese leopard cats (62). Exposure to CDV in Taiwanese leopard

354

cats is considered to be high. However, none of the leopard cats manifested clinical

355

signs of CDV. Although we targeted amplifying the nucleotide sequence of CDV

356

and identifying the strain from leopard cats, the low detection probability was

357

expected because of a short virus shedding period. Furthermore, a diseased

358

individual may reduce their activity and thus the probability that they would be

359

sampled.

360

Our study revealed CPPV-1 and FCoV infection in free-living leopard cats. The

361

sympatric domestic carnivores are considered the primary reservoir for the

362

pathogens identified in our study. Although the effects of CPPV-1 and FCoV on

363

individual leopard cats and populations of leopard cats were not evaluated in this

364

study, we strongly recommend the establishment of programs to manage CPPV-1

365

and FCoV in the leopard cat habitat with an emphasis on vaccination programs and

366

population control measures for free-roaming dogs and cats. Previous studies have

367

indicated that because of antigenic differences among CPPV-1 variants, new

368

vaccines that also provide protection against the CPV-2c variant may need to be

369

developed (40, 63).
