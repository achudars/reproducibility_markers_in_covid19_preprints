Abstract
A novel coronavirus (the SARS-CoV-2) has been identified in January 2020 as the causal
pathogen for COVID-19 pneumonia, an outbreak started near the end of 2019 in Wuhan,
China. The SARS-CoV-2 was found to be closely related to the SARS-CoV, based on the
genomic analysis. The Angiotensin converting enzyme 2 protein (ACE2) utilized by the
SARS-CoV as a receptor was found to facilitate the infection of SARS-CoV-2, initiated by
the binding of the spike protein to the human ACE2. Using homology modeling and
molecular dynamics (MD) simulation methods, we report here the detailed structure of the
ACE2 in complex with the receptor binding domain (RBD) of the SARS-CoV-2 spike
protein. The predicted model is highly consistent with the experimentally determined
complex structures. Besides the binding interface reported in the crystal structures, new
plausible binding poses were revealed from all-atom MD simulations. The simulation data
helped identify critical residues at the complex interface and provided more details about
the interactions between the SARS-CoV-2 RBD and human ACE2. Two mutants
mimicking rat ACE2 were modeled to study the mutation effects on RBD binding to ACE2.
The simulations showed that the N-terminal helix and the K353 are very important for the
tight binding of the complex, the mutants were found to alter the binding modes of the
CoV2-RBD to ACE2.

Introduction
The outbreak of a new type of severe pneumonia COVID-19 started in December 2019 1
has been going on world-wide, and caused over 15,000 fatalities, infected more than
350,000 individuals globally. Although the earlier infected cases were mainly found in
China before March, 2020, particularly in Hubei Province, the confirmed COVID-19 cases
have been reported in more than 160 countries or territories by the end of March, 2020, and
still increasing rapidly. One urgent desire in coping with this global crisis is to develop or
discover drugs that can treat the diseases caused by the novel coronavirus, the SARS-CoV2 (also known as 2019-nCoV)2. According to the genome comparative studies, the SARSCoV-2 belongs to the genus beta-coronavirus, with nucleotide sequence identity of about

96% compared to the closest bat coronavirus RaTG13, about 89% compared to two other
bat SARS-like viruses (Bat-SL-CoVZC45 & Bat-SL-CoVZXC21), and 79% compared to
the SARS-CoV 3,4. Furthermore, the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein has a protein sequence
identity of 73% for the receptor binding domain (RBD) with the SARS-CoV RBD
(denoted as SARS-RBD in the following). The SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 both utilize
the human Angiotensin converting enzyme 2 protein (ACE2) to initiate the spike protein
binding and facilitate the fusion to host cells 5–9. The 193-residue RBD of the SARS-CoV
spike protein has been found to be sufficient to bind the human ACE2 6. Based on this fact,
the RBD of SARS-CoV-2 becomes a critical protein target for drug development to treat
the COVID-19. When this study was started, neither the crystal structure of the SARSCoV-2 spike protein nor the RBD segment were determined, so the homology modeling
approach was applied to construct the model of the SARS-CoV-2 spike RBD in complex
with the human ACE2 binding domain (denoted as CoV2-RBD/ACE2 in the following).
Similar approach has been applied to predict the complex structure and estimate the
binding energies 3. Because of the high sequence similarity between CoV2-RBD and
SARS-RBD, the predicted structure was found to be highly consistent with the resolved
crystal structures 10 (see another crystal structure at http://nmdc.cn/nCoV
entry:NMDCS0000001, PDBID: 6LZG). These structures laid the foundation for the
dynamics investigation of the CoV2-RBD/ACE2 complex using computational simulation
method. The predicted CoV2-RBD/ACE2 model was subjected to all-atom molecular
dynamics (MD) simulations to study the binding interactions.

Although the crystal structure and the predicted model of the CoV2-RBD/ACE2 complex
provide important information about the binding interactions at the molecular interfaces,
MD simulations can extend the knowledge to a dynamics regime in a fully solvated
environment. The importance of the ACE2 residues was investigated by simulating the
complexes with ACE2 mutants, in which partial dissociation from the ACE2 was observed
within 500 ns simulations. The control simulations of the SARS-RBD/ACE2 complexes
allowed the detailed comparison in receptor binding for the two different types of viruses.
The results showed that the wild type CoV2-RBD/ACE2 complex is stable in 500 ns
simulations, especially in the well-defined binding interface. On the other hand, the
mutations on the helix-1 or K353 of the ACE2 can alter the binding, revealing new binding
poses with reduced contacts compared to those in the crystal structures. The analysis of the
interaction energy showed that the binding is enhanced by adjusting conformations to form

more favorable interactions as the simulation progressed, consistent with the increased
hydrogen bonding patterns. Furthermore, the analysis also showed that SARS-RBD and
CoV2-RBD have comparable binding affinities to the ACE2, with the former slightly
stronger than the latter in terms of molecular mechanics energies. The dynamic
information obtained by this study shall be useful in understanding SARS-CoV-2 host
interaction and for designing inhibitors to block CoV2-RBD binding.

Methods
The computer model of the SARS-CoV-2 spike RBD in complex with human ACE2
The spike RBD of SARS-CoV-2 (GenBank: MN908947 2) comprises Cys336-Gly526
residues according to the sequence homology analysis with SARS-CoV spike RBD (see
Figure S1). The predicted three-dimensional structure model of these residues was
obtained with the SWISS-MODEL server 11. This predicted SARS-CoV-2 RBD model was
subsequently superimposed into the X-ray structure of SARS-CoV RBD in complex with
human ACE2 (PDB code:2AJF, Chain D 7). Finally, the computer model of SARS-CoV-2
RBD with human ACE2 (CoV2-RBD/ACE2) was obtained for further simulations and
analysis.

Mutant preparation
Based on the analysis of the predicted model, sequence alignment, and literature survey,
two other systems containing mutations in the human ACE2 were prepared and subject to
MD simulation studies. The mutant construct is based on the fact that Rat ACE2 markedly
diminishes interactions with SARS spike protein 12, and it was proposed that the rat ACE2
likely has reduced binding affinity to the CoV2-RBD 13. To investigate the roles of critical
residues on the ACE2, we created two mutants of the human ACE2 (see Table 1): (1)
mutant mut_h1, with the ACE2 N-terminal (residue 19-40) mutated to the residues of rat
ACE2; and (2) mutant K353H, in which the highly conserved K353 was mutated to
histidine (the corresponding amino acid in rat and mouse ACE2 proteins). To focus on the
impact of these two binding sites, the rest of the ACE2 were kept to be the same as human
ACE2.

The predicted model of CoV2-RBD/ACE2 complex was used as the starting models for MD
simulations. The spike protein RBD domain is composed of 180 residues (323-502), while
the ACE2 protein contains 597 residues (19-615) from the N-terminal domain. The
simulation parameterization and equilibration were prepared for complex structures including
the mutant systems, using the CHARMM-GUI webserver 14. Each system was solvated in
TIP3P water and sodium chloride ions were added to neutralize the systems to a salt
concentration of 150 mM. Approximately, each system was composed of about 220,000
atoms that were parametrized with the CHARMM36 force field 15.

After energy minimization using the steepest descent algorithm, each system was equilibrated
at human body temperature 310.15 K, which was maintained by Nose-Hoover scheme with
1.0 ps coupling constant in the NVT ensemble (constant volume and temperature) for 125.0
ps under periodic boundary conditions with harmonic restraint forces applied to the complex
molecules (400 kJ mol−1 nm−2 on backbone and 40 kJ mol−1 nm−2 on the side chains) 16,17. In
the subsequent step, the harmonic restraints were removed and the NPT ensembles were
simulated at one atmosphere pressure (105 Pa) and body temperature. The pressure was
maintained by isotropic Parrinello-Rahman barostat 18, with a compressibility of
4.5 × 10−5 bar−1 and coupling time constant of 5.0 ps. The simulation trajectories were
propagated to 500 nanoseconds using the GROMACS 5.1.2 package 19.

Three independent trajectories starting from random velocities based on Maxwell
distributions were simulated for both CoV2-RBD/ACE2 and SARS-RBD/ACE2 complex
systems in their wild types. In all simulations, a time step of 2.0 fs was used and the PME
(particle mesh Ewald) 20 was applied for long-range electrostatic interactions beyond 12.0 Å.
The van der Waals interactions were evaluated within the distance cutoff of 12.0 Å.
Hydrogen atoms were constrained using the LINCS algorithm 21.

The human ACE2 mutants in complex with CoV2-RBD were constructed as described
previously. Each mutant complex model was simulated in two independent trajectories.
Furthermore, as the crystal structure of the CoV2-RBD/ACE2 complex became available,
two additional simulations were carried out using the crystal structure as the starting model to
cross-validate the simulation results based on the homology model. Each trajectory was
propagated to 500 ns by following the same protocol as the wild type CoV2-RBD/ACE2
complex simulations.

Analyses were carried out with tools in GROMACS (rmsd, rmsf, energy, and pairdist) to
examine the system properties, including the overall stability, local residue and general
structure fluctuations through the simulations. The g_mmpbsa program 22 was applied to
extract the molecular mechanics energy EMM (Lennard Jones and electrostatic interactions)
between ACE2 and the RBD of spike proteins. VMD and Chimera were applied to analyze
the hydrogen bonds, molecular binding interface, water distributions, visualization, and
rending model images 23,24.

Results
The homology structure of the CoV2-RBD/ACE2 was compared to both the SARSRBD/ACE2 crystal structure and the newly resolved crystal structure of the CoV2RBD/ACE2. The results indicated that the homology model is accurate, especially at the
binding interface. The MD simulations further refined the side chain orientations to
improve the model quality. The simulation data confirmed the highly stable binding
between the CoV2-RBD and the ACE2, in spite of the conformational changes of the
ACE2. The relative movement between the CoV2-RBD and the ACE2 mainly exhibited as
a swinging motion pivoted at the binding interface. Simulations also revealed the roles of
water molecules in the binding of the RBD to the ACE2 receptor. The MD simulation of
complex with ACE2 mutants suggested that mutation to the ACE2 helix-1 and the K353
can alter the binding modes and binding affinity.

1. Homology modeling and comparison to the SARS-RBD/ACE2 complex
The predicted CoV2-RBD/ACE2 complex structure is highly similar to the SARSRBD/ACE2, as shown in Figure 1. The RBD domain has an RMSD of 0.99 Å for the
aligned residues (1.53 Å for all 174 residue pairs), indicating that the homology model of
the CoV2-RBD is in good agreement with the SARS-RBD. For ACE2 residues near the
binding interface (within 4.0 Å of the RBD), the RMSD is smaller than 0.43 Å compared
to the SARS-RBD/ACE2 complex. The superposed structures revealed that the
RBD/ACE2 interfaces are almost identical in two complexes(Figure 1c).

In a retrospective comparison, the homology model was superposed to a newly resolved
crystal structure (PDB ID: 6LZG; see Figure 2d for a detailed comparison at the interface).

The results indicate that the homology model is very accurate, especially for the binding
interface. The residues near the CoV2-RBD/ACE2 interface (defined as the combined set
of ACE2 residues within 4.0 Å of RBD and the RBD residues within 4.0 Å of the ACE2)
exhibited a difference of 0.43 Å RMSD, which is comparable to the difference between the
two independently reported crystal models (an RMSD of 0.25 Å for the same comparison).
The RMSD is about 0.77 Å for residues in an extended region within 10.0 Å of the binding
interface. The RBD domain of the spike protein showed an overall RMSD values less than
1.5 Å, and the ACE2 domain with an RMSD about 2.0 Å between the predicted model and
the crystal structures.

2. The conformational changes of the ACE2 and the CoV2-RBD
The structural comparison with respect to the starting structure revealed that MD
simulations mainly sampled the structures in the conformational space near the starting
model. The RMSD with respect to the starting model indicated that the sampled structures
were mostly 2.5 Å to 5.0 Å compared to the starting model (Figure 3a). The largest
contribution to the conformational changes in CoV2-RBD is from the loop regions,
indicated by the peaks shown in the fluctuation plots (Figure 3b). The residues with welldefined secondary structures (mainly β-strands) exhibited very small conformational
changes (the RMSD is about 1.0 Å including side chain atoms), while the loop regions
have RMSD values between 3.7 Å to 5.4 Å. This is consistent with the residue fluctuations
measured with the RMSF (root-mean-square-fluctuation) for the RBD subunit (Figure 3b).
For the ACE2 receptor domain, the major conformational change is the opening/closing of
the enzymatic active site, which is remote from the RBD binding interface (see Video 1).
The CoV2-RBD remained bound to human ACE2, even though substantial conformational
changes occurred to the ACE2 and the loop region of the RBD. This observation implies
that the binding of CoV2-RBD to the ACE2 is very stable, similar with the case of the
SARS-RBD that binds to both open and closed forms of human ACE2 7,25.

Based on the structural similarity, a clustering analysis was carried out to identify the most
populated structures, from which the representative model for each trajectory was selected
(Figure 3). The CoV2-RBD/ACE2 interfaces were highlighted using blue/red colors with
stick representations. The RMSD of structures in the simulations were calculated with
respect to the these representative models, in order to assess the model convergence and
coverage of the simulated conformations (Figure 3a, right panels). The RMSD values

indicated that a large portions of the structures sampled by the MD simulations are similar
to the representative model (Figure 3a, for trajectory 1, see Figure S2 for the other
trajectories). Furthermore, as the simulation progressed, the conformations converged to
the representative model obtained from this trajectory. This indicates that the selected
structure is plausible and stable. The representative structures for the other two trajectories
showed smaller deviations compared to the predicted model (Figure 2b and 2c).

In three simulations of the CoV2-RBD/ACE2 systems, the binding interface was highly
stable, exhibiting very small conformational changes, especially for the interfacing
residues of the ACE2 protein. The RMSD for the residues at the RBD binding interface is
0.85Å (+/-0.13Å) on average. Side chain atom positions were refined to form more
favorable interactions (Figure 2d). One outstanding example is the K31 side-chain, which
pointed in the wrong orientation in the predicted structure, was quickly refined to the
correct orientation, consistent with the crystal structure (right panel of Figure 2d).

In terms of collective conformational changes, the CoV2-RBD/ACE2 complex showed
two interesting movements: (1) the loop (L67) between β6 and β7 (residues between S477
and G485 in particular) of CoV2-RBD was found to expand its interactions with the Nterminal helix (the helix-1) of the ACE2 (Figure 2a), while it pointed away from the helix1 in the predicted and the crystal structures (Figure 2d, left); (2) a tilting movement of the
RBD relative to the ACE2 was observed, which can be depicted as a swinging motion with
the binding interface as the pivot (see Figure 4 for an illustration). In both predicted and
the crystal structures of the CoV2-RBD/ACE2 complex, the L67 does not form close
contacts with the ACE2. The analysis of the crystal packing revealed that this loop
participated in the interaction with another asymmetric unit (see Figure S3). Interestingly,
the simulation data suggested that the L67 could move towards the ACE2 and form contacts
with the helix-1. This can potentially enhance the binding, as reflected in the change of
interaction energies. In the crystal structure, the C480 and C488 of the RBD are crosslinked via a disulfide bond that reduces the flexibility of the L67 region, limiting its access
to the ACE2. On the other hand, it has been reported that the binding of SARS-RBD to
ACE2 is insensitive to the redox states of the cysteines to a high extend 26. Based on the
simulation results, we hypothesize that the reduced form of C480 and C488 can also exist
during the virus invasion to host cells, and the reduced cysteines can potentially enhance
the binding to ACE2. In the other two simulation trajectories, we found that the L67

remained in conformations similar to that in the crystal structure and the cysteines (C480
and C488) were close enough for disulfide bond formation.

3. Simulations revealed detailed binding interface interactions between the CoV2RBD and the ACE2
By examining the binding interface of CoV2-RBD and the ACE2, we found the polar and
charged residues account for a large fraction, therefore the electrostatic interactions play
critical roles for the complex formation. Based on the distances between the two proteins,
the key residues at the binding interface were identified and summarized in Table 2 for the
three representative models (see Figure 2). Majority of these residues are conserved for
these three models, except that the model#1 (Figure 2a) has additional contacts to the
ACE2 from residues in the L67 region (highlighted with green color in Table 2). As shown
in Figure 2, the L67 remained in the starting position for the other two representative
models (Figure 2b,c). The same simulations were carried out for the SARS-RBD/ACE2
complex, serving as a comparative system. Interestingly, the SARS-RBD counterpart of
the L67 in CoV2-RBD did not form close contacts with the ACE2 in three simulations. It is
worthwhile to mention that the sequence identity between CoV2-RBD and SARS-RBD is
low in this loop region, suggesting the loop region might be partially responsible for the
difference in the receptor binding.

The hydrogen bonds between the CoV2-RBD and ACE2 were extracted using VMD
program with default criteria (D-A distance cutoff=3.0 Å and D-H-A angle cutoff=20
degrees, where D,A,H are Donor atom, Acceptor atom, and the Hydrogen atom linked to
the Donor atom). The numbers of hydrogen bonds are summarized in Figure 5 for the
simulation trajectory#1. Because of the stringent criteria for hydrogen bonds, the numbers
are smaller compared to the reported values in other studies. For a larger distance cutoff of
3.9Å, there are about 8.3 hydrogen bonds on average (Figure 5b). We observed that the
number of hydrogen bonds fluctuated over time, and exhibiting an overall increasing trend
indicated by the fitted lines (Figure 5). Similar trends were observed in the other
simulations, suggesting that the binding became stronger as the simulation progressed (see
Figure S4). Based on the statistics of three simulation trajectories, the CoV2-RBD/ACE2
complex has 2.7 hydrogen bonds between the subunits on average with stringent criteria.
In comparison, the SARS-RBD/ACE2 has 3.2 hydrogen bonds on average (see Figure S4

for details). The statistics of hydrogen bonds suggest a slightly weaker binding between the
CoV2-RBD and the ACE2, relative to the SARS-RBD/ACE2 complex.

It is also noteworthy to point out the important roles of water molecules at the complex
interface for CoV2-RBD/ACE2 complex. At any instant time, there are approximately 15
water molecules at the binding interface, simultaneously located within 2.5 Å of both the
CoV2-RBD and the ACE2 (Figure 6). These water molecules can function as bridges by
forming hydrogen bonds with the residues from the RBD or the ACE2. The dwelling time
of water molecules at the interface can be a few nanoseconds, as revealed by the MD
simulations. This results is also consistent with the crystal structure, which has 12 water
molecules at the interface (Figure 6c). These discoveries emphasize the role of the water
molecules, which desires detailed quantification to understand the interactions between the
RBD and the ACE2.

4. Simulation of the human ACE2 mutants uncovers new binding modes
It has been demonstrated that the ACE2 from several mammalian species possess high
sequence similarities, yet their binding to the SARS-RBD differs significantly. In
particular, the binding of SARS-RBD to the rat ACE2 is much weaker as discovered in
experiments 12. Inspired by these information, two mutants of the CoV2-RBD/ACE2 were
constructed: (1) ACE2-mut-h1 by mutating N-terminal helix-1 to that of the rat ACE2; (2)
ACE2-K353H by mutating K353 to Histidine (the amino acid in wild type Rat ACE2).
Two 500-ns MD simulations were carried out for each mutant system. The simulation
showed that the mutations in ACE2-mut-h1 reduced the interaction between the CoV2RBD and the helix-1, and the ACE2-K353H showed weaker binding between the CoV2RBD and the β-hairpin centered at the H353. Using the clustering analysis, the
representative structures were identified from each simulation trajectory (Figure 7).
Although the overall topology is very similar to the wild type complex structure, there are
pronounced differences. For the ACE2-mut-h1 system, the CoV2-RBD tilted further away
from the ACE12 helix-1 in one simulation (Figure 7a); and the CoV2-RBD lost its contact
with helix-13 (G326 to N330) in another simulation for the ACE2-K353H (Figure 7c). In
the wild type ACE2, the K353 is a hydrogen donor, and its mutant H353 cannot form the
hydrogen bond with the CoV2-RBD as in the wild type CoV2-RBD/ACE2 complex. The
number of contacting residue pairs was significantly reduced in the ACE2-K353H mutant
system. This is in line with the report that K353 is more critical than the other residues, as

its hydrophobic neighborhood enables this positively charged residue high selectivity to
the RBD 27,28.

The physical interactions between the RBD and the ACE2 were quantified for the
simulated structures. We considered the molecular mechanics energy EMM , which is
composed of the van der Waals and the electrostatic interactions. Furthermore, the number
of residue contacts (NC) between (RBD and ACE2) was extracted from simulated
structures. Both the EMM and NC indicate that the RBD interactions with the ACE2 are
comparable for CoV2 and SARS spike proteins (Figure 8). From the simulations, the
CoV2-RBD has more close contacts with the ACE2 than the SARS-RBD: the numbers of
contacts for CoV2-RBD/ACE2 and SARS-RBD/ACE2 are 32.9 and 30.4 respectively. In
terms of interaction energies, CoV2-RBD showed slightly weaker interactions with the
ACE2 compared to the SARS-RBD (EMM values are -1017.1 kJ/mol vs. -1133.4 kJ/mol).
We would like to point out that the energy EMM is the physical interaction between the
RBD and the ACE2, rather than the binding energy, which requires accurately
incorporating solvation energy and entropy. Furthermore, the standard deviations of EMM
are 70.2 kJ/mol and 65.5 kJ/mol for the two complexes. Therefore, we infer that the
binding affinities are comparable for CoV2-RBD/ACE2 and SARS-RBD/ACE2. The
simulations started from the predicted and crystal models yielded very similar results
(purple triangles). This is in line with a recent study, in which the authors showed similar
binding affinity to human ACE2 for both SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV spike proteins 29.
They found the association rate constants kon to be the same at 1.4x105 M-1s-1, while the
SARS-CoV spike protein showed a faster dissociation, with the rate constant koff to be
7.1x10-4 s-1, about 4.4 times larger than the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein koff =1.6x10-4 s-1.
similar kon values and the equilibrium dissociation constants KD in nanomolar range were
reported in other studies for SARS-CoV-2 spike protein (or RBD) binding to human
ACE210,30.

More interestingly, the mutation impacts were reflected in the EMM and NC analysis: the
ACE2-mut_h1 is likely to reduce the binding to the ACE2 due to the tilting movement of
CoV2-RBD, making it further from the ACE2 helix-1 (the blue triangle symbol at lower

K353H mutants (green diamonds), the number of contacts were both reduced compared to
the wild type system. In one simulation, the contacts between the CoV2-RBD and the
Helix-13 of the ACE2 were completely lost (see Figure 7c), consistent with the less
favorable interactions reflected on an increase of EMM. For the SARS-RBD interaction with
the ACE2-mut_h1, both simulations revealed fewer contacts compared to the wild type
SARS-RBD/ACE2 complex (purple stars in Figure 8). Although direct observation of
dissociation is beyond the reach of all-atom MD simulations, the reduced contacts for
mutant ACE2 indicates the weaker binding affinity compared to the wild type human
ACE2.

Discussions and Conclusion
The homology modeling of the CoV2-RBD/ACE2 complex yielded highly consistent
models compared to the crystal structures. All-atom molecular dynamics simulations were
carried out to study the dynamic interactions of CoV2-RBD with human ACE2, the results
were compared to the SARS-RBD/ACE2 system. The human ACE2 mutants were also
constructed to mimic the rat ACE2 to investigate the roles of critical residues, and possible
binding modes in other mammals. It is observed that MD simulations improved the
structure at the binding interface and strengthened the interactions between the subunits.
The structure of the complex interface is highly stable for all simulations of CoV2RBD/ACE2 complex in the wild type. The loop region between β6 and β7 can potentially
form more contacts with the ACE2 as observed in one simulation trajectory. The
simulations results also reveal that the interactions between CoV2-RBD and the ACE2 are
mediated by water molecules at the interfaces, stressing the necessity of accounting for the
explicit water molecules when quantifying the binding affinity.

The interactions between the RBD and the ACE2 were quantified by physical interaction
energies (molecular mechanics energy) and the number of contacting residues. The
detailed comparison results suggest that the CoV2-RBD and the SARS-RBD bind to
human ACE2 with comparable affinity. The comparison between the SARS-RBD/ACE2
and the CoV2-RBD/ACE2 complexes, with the former forms fewer contacts than the latter
(Figure 8), yet exhibiting stronger interactions. The decomposition of the EMM to the van
der Waals and the electrostatic interactions revealed that the major difference is attributed
to the electrostatic interactions. Furthermore, we compared the major contacting residues

and found that the SARS-RBD has two charged residues (R426 and D463) and the CoV2RBD has only one charged residue (K417) at the complex interface. The polar and
hydrophobic residues are comparable in the two RBDs. This is consistent with the statistics
of hydrogen bonds at the complex interfaces.

This study was started with a structure predicted using homology modeling method, which
later found to be highly consistent with the crystal structure, demonstrating the potentiality
of structure prediction and dynamics simulation in revealing molecular details before the
availability of high resolution experimental information. Furthermore, the interactions
between CoV2-RBD and the ACE2 mutants mimicking rat ACE2 protein were
investigated. The results provide valuable information at the atomic level for the reduced
binding affinity. The recent report on the SARS-CoV-2 infection to a dog 31 raise the
concerns about the COVID-19 transmissions to pet animals. The approach discussed in this
study can be applied to analyze the CoV2-RBD interaction with a broader ACE2 variants,
including the genetic polymorphism of the ACE2 in human and the ACE2 of other
mammalian animals. Preliminary analysis of several ACE2 proteins from mammalian
animals using homology modeling and active site prediction methods shows that the
binding sites exhibit different features compared to the human ACE2. More thorough and
deeper analysis can be carried out using the presented approach.

The high quality homology model allowed us to start the simulation analysis before the
high resolution experimental data became available. The protein structure prediction
community are making efforts to provide high quality models using advanced modeling
and prediction methods 32–35. Based on predicted and experimentally determined structures,
molecular dynamics simulations will add more insights to the molecular mechanism and
allow better probing properties due to mutation or modification to proteins.
