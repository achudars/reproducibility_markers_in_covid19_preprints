ABSTRACT
18

By late 2020, the coronavirus disease (COVID-19) pandemic, caused by SARS-CoV-2
has caused tens of millions of infections and over 1 million deaths worldwide. A protective

20

vaccine and more effective therapeutics are urgently needed. We evaluated a new PARP
inhibitor, stenoparib, which was recently advanced to Stage II clinical trials for treatment of

22

ovarian cancer, for activity against human respiratory coronaviruses, including SARS-CoV-2, in
vitro. Stenoparib exhibits dose-dependent suppression of SARS-CoV-2 multiplication and spread

24

in Vero E6 monkey kidney and Calu-3 human lung adenocarcinoma cells. Stenoparib was also

strongly inhibitory to the HCoV-NL63 human seasonal respiratory coronavirus. Compared to
26

remdesivir, which inhibits viral replication downstream of cell entry, stenoparib impedes entry
and post-entry processes as determined by time-of-addition (TOA) experiments. Moreover, a 10

28

µM dosage of stenoparib – below the approximated 25.5 µM half-maximally effective
concentration (EC50), combined with 0.5 µM remdesivir suppressed coronavirus growth by more

30

than 90%, indicating a potentially synergistic effect for this drug combination. Stenoparib as a
standalone or as part of combinatorial therapy with remdesivir should be a valuable addition to

32

the arsenal against COVID-19.

Importance
36

New therapeutics are urgently needed in the fight against COVID-19. Repurposing drugs
that are either already approved for human use or are in advanced stages of the approval process

38

can facilitate more rapid advances toward this goal. The PARP inhibitor stenoparib may be such
a drug, as it is currently in Stage II clinical trials for the treatment of ovarian cancer and its safety

40

and dosage in humans has already been established. Our results indicate that stenoparib
possesses strong antiviral activity against SARS-CoV-2 and other coronaviruses in vitro. This

42

activity appears to be based on multiple modes of action, where both pre-entry and post-entry
viral replication processes are impeded. This may provide a therapeutic advantage over many

44

current options that have a narrower target range. Moreover, our results suggest that stenoparib
and remdesivir in combination may be especially potent against coronavirus infection.

Introduction
The novel SARS-CoV-2 coronavirus emerged from Wuhan, China in late 2019, and

50

rapidly spanned the globe in a devastating pandemic (1). The disease, COVID-19, compromises
the upper and lower respiratory systems and may affect all people (2). Although in many cases

52

COVID-19 symptoms may be mild, some patients present with pulmonary distress leading to
severe lung damage, and treatment options are limited (1, 3-5). Mortality estimates range from

54

0.5% to more than 5% (6). According to the Johns Hopkins COVID Resource Center (7), as of
Nov. 10, 2020, over 10 million infections and more than 240,000 deaths have occurred due to

56

COVID-19 in the USA alone, and the pandemic continues (8). A protective vaccine may become
available (1, 2), but unless sufficient immunity can be achieved in the population, COVID-19 has

58

the potential to cause morbidity and mortality for years to come. Without a protective vaccine,
COVID-19 has largely been controlled through non-pharmaceutical measures such as quarantine,

60

social isolation, and the use of personal protective equipment. Clearly, more efficacious
treatments are needed.

62

Individuals who contract COVID-19 are most commonly infected by person-to-person
transmission, where inhaled droplets containing infectious virions are seeded into the respiratory

64

tract (1). The virions bind to respiratory epithelium via the affinity of the virus spike (S) complex
to the angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) receptor (9). A cellular serine protease

66

TMPRSS2 plays a pivotal role in S protein priming (10), which in turn facilitates fusion between
the viral and cellular plasma membranes and internalization of the virus-receptor complex by

68

endocytosis. Subsequently, the virus is uncoated and releases its single-stranded RNA genome,
which is processed, translated, and replicated in the host cytosol. Copies of the viral genome are

70

packaged into bilayer membrane envelopes, and these new infectious virions are exported from

the cell (11, 12). The SARS-CoV-2 lifecycle is typical of other coronaviruses, including the
72

highly virulent SARS-CoV, the cause of Severe Acquired Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) (9).
Conservation of key steps in the coronavirus viral lifecycles potentially constitutes an ‘Achilles

74

Heel’ that is broadly susceptible to therapeutic intervention.
Antiviral therapeutics impede interactions between the virus and the host cell. Potential

76

targets include the virus binding to the cellular receptor, viral entry or virus-host membrane
fusion, viral transcription, translation, replication and export. (1). Stenoparib is an

78

investigational, orally-available small molecule that inhibits poly (ADP- ribose) polymerase
(PARP), a key enzyme in DNA repair (13). Stenoparib is unique in that it has dual inhibitory

80

activity against the PARP 1/2 and tankyrase 1/2 enzymes, which are important regulators of the
canonical Wnt/β-catenin checkpoint that is often dysregulated in metastatic breast cancer (14).

82

Until August 2020, stenoparib was known as "2X-121” and previously as “E7449". Recently,
another PARP inhibitor mefuparib (CVL218) was shown to inhibit SARS-CoV-2 in vitro.

84

CVL218 suppressed SARS-CoV-2 infection in Vero E6 African Green Monkey cells (15). As
implied by molecular modeling studies, CVL218 and other PARP inhibitors may block viral

86

replication by interfering the viral nucleocapsid (N) protein binding to an RNA template (15).
The practice of repurposing existing drugs for new indications has advantages over

88

developing an entirely new drug (16, 17). There are numerous repurposed drugs in use, including
zidovudine, which was repurposed from the treatment of cancer to treat HIV/AIDS; the epilepsy

90

drug topiramate, which is used to treat obesity; aspirin for analgesia and the prevention of
colorectal cancer, among other examples (16). With repurposing, the risk of failure is lower

92

compared to developing a new drug, because safety trials have already been completed and the in
vivo pharmacokinetics have been characterized; thus, cost and time of development are reduced.

94

Moreover, the repurposing endeavor itself may reveal new disease targets and pathways.
Altogether, reproposing can produce more rapid and efficient returns (16, 18). Stenoparib is

96

currently in Phase II clinical trials for the treatment of ovarian cancer (14). Based on the recent
promising results of the PARP inhibitor CVL218 against SARS-CoV-2 in vitro (15), we

98

evaluated the activity of stenoparib against SARS-CoV-2, with an eye toward its use as a
treatment for COVID-19.

Results
Stenoparib inhibits the replication of SARS-CoV-2 in Vero E6 cells. Based on the

104

reported antiviral activity of other PARP inhibitors on SARS-CoV-2 in vitro (15) we aimed to
determine whether stenoparib possessed a similar activity against the virus. Stenoparib was

106

prepared as a solution in dimethylsulfoxide (DMSO) and used to treat Vero E6 cells infected
with SARS-CoV-2 (USA-WA1/2020). Vero E6 is a common cell platform for propagating

108

coronaviruses, including SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV (19, 20). At 48 hours (h) after infection,
RNA was isolated from cell supernatants, and viral copy number was estimated by reverse-

110

transcription quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (RT-qPCR). Viral RNA
measurements were compared to untreated cell controls, and to infected cells treated with a

112

cocktail of camostat mesylate and E64d (‘C/E’), which are protease inhibitors that impede
processing of the virus spike protein and interfere with its entry into the cell (10, 21). In parallel,

114

we assessed potential toxic effects of stenoparib using the lactate dehydrogenase release assay,
which indicates cytotoxicity due to cell lysis. As shown in Fig. 1, stenoparib demonstrated dose-

116

dependent activity against SARS-CoV-2 at concentrations up to 30 µM with negligible
cytotoxicity. The significant 63.2% reduction in viral load following treatment (t=8.608,

118

P=0.0010) is comparable to the results reported for the CVL218 PARP inhibitor (35.2-99.7%
inhibition) at comparable concentrations (15).

120

At concentrations higher than 30 µM, and treatment durations exceeding 48 h, stenoparib
displayed marked cytotoxicity to Vero E6 cells (Fig. 2A), which limited our capacity to

122

comprehensively test the activity of the drug. We used a stenoparib response software predictor
to pre-assess the susceptibility of human tumor cells based on the quantitative activity of 414

124

genes (22). When applied to human cell lines used with SARS-CoV-2 (23), the algorithm

predicted that LLC-MK2 cells would be less sensitive to stenoparib toxicity than Vero E6 cells.
126

The cell line Calu-3, originally isolated from the pleural effusion of a patient with lung
adenocarcinoma (24), was predicted to be even more resistant than LLC-MK2. We verified this

128

prediction for Calu-3 cells using stenoparib concentrations up to 60 µM, and exposure for up to
120 h, with no elevation in cytotoxicity over baseline conditions (t=8.237, P=0.0144) (Fig. 2B).

130

Calu-3 lung epithelial cells as a platform for SARS-CoV-2. Since Calu-3 cells were
more resistant to the toxic effects of stenoparib than Vero E6 cells, we utilized Calu-3 cells to

132

test the effectiveness of higher doses than were previously achievable with Vero E6. The viral
plaque assay comprehensively assesses inhibitors on the viral intracellular lifecycle, from virus

134

entry, to multiplication, and cell to cell spread. Plaques result from cell damage and death
following infection, appearing as empty regions or “dead zones” in the cell monolayer (25).

136

Fresh media containing 2% FBS, with or without stenoparib or C/E control inhibitors, was
applied to confluent monolayers of Calu-3 cells, which were then infected with SARS-CoV-2 for

138

1 h. At this time the infection media was removed, and the cells were overlaid with a semisolid
matrix consisting of cell growth medium in 1.2% low melting temperature agarose, with or

140

without stenoparib or control inhibitors. At 120 h post infection, cells were fixed with
paraformaldehyde, stained with crystal violet, and the number of plaques were visually counted.

142

As shown in Fig. 3A (see also Fig. S1), treatment with 30 µM stenoparib resulted in a 30.6%
reduction of plaque forming units (PFUs) per well compared to infected, untreated cells (t=3.054,

144

P=0.0379). Using a higher dose of 60 µM stenoparib, we observed near complete inhibition of
plaque formation (94.0%; t=10.24, P=0.0005) with no significant cytotoxicity (t=0.446,

146

P=0.6992), approaching the effect of the C/E control inhibitor (Fig. S1). These observations are
mirrored by the results from RT-qPCR, which showed an 80.6% reduction of viral copy number

148

with 60 µM stenoparib (P<0.0001). These observations affirm the prediction that Calu-3 cells are
more resistant to the effects of stenoparib than Vero E6 cells and are suitable hosts for SARS-

150

CoV-2 in vitro. It is interesting to speculate that Calu-3 cells may exhibit a degree of resistance
to conditions that can be rapidly toxic in other, more rapidly dividing cell lines, which warrants

152

further exploration. Indeed, the in vitro doubling time of Calu-3 cells (>60 h) was notably slower
than either the Vero E6 (~24 h) or the LLC-MK2 (~36 h) cell lines.

154

The NL63 virus as a surrogate in vitro model. In addition to SARS-CoV-2, several
other human coronaviruses, including SARS-CoV, interact with human cells via the ACE2

156

receptor, and multiply intracellularly utilizing similar pathways (9). This group includes the
respiratory coronavirus HCoV-NL63 (or just ‘NL63’), which is a cause of the seasonal colds in

158

humans. While symptoms are generally mild, NL63 infections can be serious in infants and
immunocompromised individuals (26-28). Based on its relatedness to SARS-CoV-2, and to

160

establish a surrogate system for use in Biosafety Level-2 (BSL-2) instead of BSL-3 laboratory
conditions, we evaluated NL63 for testing the effects of stenoparib.

162

The NL63 virus (NR-470) was propagated in LLC-MK2 Rhesus macaque kidney cells
(29). Viral replication levels were assessed by plaque assay and RT-qPCR as performed for

164

SARS-CoV-2. Controls were infected/untreated cells, and infected cells treated with the C/E
inhibitor cocktail. Overall, the effects of stenoparib on NL63 corroborated the results of our

166

experiments with SARS-CoV-2. Treatment resulted in a dose-dependent decrease in virus
replication, achieving a 69.3% and 95.8% reduction of plaquing efficiency and viral copy

168

number with 30 µM stenoparib, measured by plaque assay and RT-qPCR, respectively,
compared to untreated controls (t=7.982 and 12.82, P=0.0002 for both) (Fig. 4A and Fig. 4B).

170

Identifying effects of stenoparib on the coronavirus lifecycle. Coronavirus inhibitors
may target one or several intracellular growth stages, including virus entry (camostat mesylate,

172

hydroxychloroquine), endosomal processing (hydroxychloroquine, rapamycin), translation and
RNA processing (lopinavir), and transcription and replication (remdesivir) (1, 11, 30). By

174

altering the time of addition (TOA) and duration of treatment in vitro, we can discern whether a
drug affects virus entry, intracellular growth, or both. TOA experiments were conducted using

176

the viral plaque assay with NL63 as a surrogate for SARS-CoV-2. RT-qPCR was performed in
parallel to measure viral loads. We used remdesivir as a reference inhibitor, since its mechanism,

178

target and dosage range are known (31). Experiments to determine the lifecycle stages affected
by stenoparib were performed as follows: a) to ascertain the effect on virus entry, cells were

180

transiently exposed to compounds starting 1 h before infection, and ending 1 h after infection; b)
for effects on post-entry events, including transcription, processing, translation or replication,

182

compounds were added 1 h after infection, when a number of virions would have already entered
cells, and treatment was continued until the experimental endpoint at 120 h; c) to examine the

184

maximum achievable effect of the compounds, a full-time assay was performed. Treatment was
initiated simultaneously with virus infection and continued until the 120 h endpoint (see

186

Methods for a detailed description).
As shown in Fig. 5A, the antiviral activity of stenoparib is most notable when added

188

post-infection. The 60 µM stenoparib dose achieved complete inhibition of NL63 plaquing, with
no detectable (N/D) plaques following post-entry treatment compared to untreated cells

190

(P<0.0001). This is on par with the effect of 4 µM remdesivir, which also eliminated plaque
formation. Likewise, assay results for the full-time treatment were comparable between

192

stenoparib and remdesivir, with 88.4% reduction in plaque efficiency for stenoparib (t=5.582,

10

P=0.0051), and full inhibition for remdesivir vs. untreated cells. This is consistent with our
194

results from RT-qPCR, where stenoparib produced 98.7% (t=9.988, P=0.0099) and 95.5%
(t=9.663, P=0.0105) inhibition vs. untreated controls for post-entry and full-time drug exposure,

196

and also comparable to the activity of remdesivir. These data are in line with those reported
previously for the CVL218 PARP inhibitor and remdesivir (15).

198

With the plaque assay, we noticed a 16.5% reduction in plaque formation following
transient treatment with stenoparib early in the infection time course (i.e. ‘Entry’; Fig. 5A). This

200

effect was not markedly different than the results recorded for remdesivir (-27.8%; t=1.919,
P=0.1275). Inhibition of virus entry is not expected for remdesivir since its activity is specific to

202

blocking of RNA replication (31, 32), which is a mid-late event in the viral lifecycle. In contrast,
our results from RT-qPCR strongly support a specific effect for stenoparib on inhibiting virus

204

entry, where a 37.9% reduction in viral load is observed in the entry assay compared to just a
3.1% reduction for remdesivir (t=4.352, P=0.0121) (Fig. 5B). Effects on viral entry are

206

consistent with the predicted activity of stenoparib on processes involved in early coronavirus
infection events (see Discussion). Taken as a whole, these observations suggest that stenoparib

208

may affect multiple targets that play roles in the early and late stages of coronavirus intracellular
multiplication.

210

The combination of stenoparib and remdesivir strongly inhibits NL63. Combination
drug therapies are widely used for the treatment for some of the worst human diseases, including

212

cancer (33), HIV/AIDS (34), and multidrug-resistant tuberculosis (35). The strategy of
combination therapy seeks to increase the beneficial effects of multiple drugs, lower their doses

214

to reduce adverse effects, and minimize the induction of resistance (36). Generally, the activity
of a drug combination is considered additive when the combined effect of two drugs is

11

216

equivalent to their individual doses, while if the effect is less than additive, the combination is
considered antagonistic. Synergy occurs when the combined effect is greater than the additive

218

effect (36). Combinations of two or more drugs may lead to a synergistic effect by combining
different mechanisms of action (MOA). Examples of synergistic combinations of drugs with

220

distinct MOAs include streptomycin–penicillin (37), trimethoprim–sulfa drugs (Co-trimoxazole)
(38), and b-lactam/b-lactamase inhibitor combinations such as amoxicillin-clavulanate (39)

222

against bacterial infections.
Based on the fact that stenoparib and remdesivir inhibit coronavirus by distinct MOAs

224

(31, 32, 40), we approximated the half maximal effective concentration (EC50) of stenoparib and
remdesivir as 25.5 µM and 0.46 µM using the NL63 virus and plaque assays. Calculations were

226

aided by the online calculator from AAT Bioquest ("Quest Graph™ EC50 Calculator." AAT
Bioquest, Inc, 26 Oct. 2020, https://www.aatbio.com/tools/ec50-calculator). We hypothesized

228

that a combination of stenoparib and remdesivir would be more potent than the individual
compounds. To test this, we combined a range of doses of stenoparib with 0.5 µM remdesivir

230

and tested these for activity against NL63.
As shown in Fig. 6, complete inhibition of NL63 plaque formation was achieved with 60

232

µM stenoparib, in line with our earlier results with SARS-CoV-2 and Calu-3 cells (Fig. 3).
Complete inhibition was also achieved with 1.0 µM remdesivir. However, a combination of 10

234

µM stenoparib and 0.5 µM remdesivir was more effective than either compound alone at these
doses, achieving 90.7% inhibition for the combination, vs. 18.5% inhibition for 10 µM

236

stenoparib, and 65.6% for 0.5 µM remdesivir, suggesting at least additive effects when the drugs
are combined. Notably, the stenoparib dose (10 µM) used in the combination is far below the

stenoparib and remdesivir as a combinatorial therapy for SARS-family coronavirus infections.

Discussion
242

Prior to the emergence of COVID-19, attempts to identify inhibitors of coronavirus were
mainly focused on SARS- and MERS-CoVs. The recent efforts to develop COVID-19

244

therapeutics spans the gamut from new drug discovery to repurposing existing drugs. There are
some excellent reviews on the subject (17, 41). Here, we focus on the compound stenoparib,

246

formerly known as 2X-121, an inhibitor of the cellular enzyme PARP-1/2. Stenoparib is thought
to inhibit SARS-CoV-2 by multiple mechanisms, predominately by inhibiting of ADP-

248

ribosylation of proteins required for virus replication and assembly (42). ADP-ribosylation is a
conserved, post-translational modification that is key for proper formation of the coronavirus

250

nucleocapsid, and inhibition can negatively affect packaging of the viral genome and virion
stability. Specific targets of ADP-ribosylation include viral nsp3 protein, which is essential for

252

virulence and a component of the replication/transcription complex (RTC) (43, 44). Moreover,
PARP inhibitors may exert additional protective effects at the host and cellular levels by

254

reducing depletion of NAD+ and ATP that leads to cell necrosis (40), as well as decreasing the
pro-inflammatory NF-kB-triggered cytokine storm that can damage host organs (45). It has also

256

been suggested that PARP inhibitors enhance the degradation of the host type I interferon
receptor (IFN-1R), which would also have a modulatory effect on the host inflammatory

258

response (46).
In this study, inhibition of SARS-family coronaviruses by stenoparib in vitro is likely due

260

to interference with multiple stages of the virus lifecycle. Consistent with its predicted
mechanism, stenoparib is effective when introduced post-infection. Additionally, we noted an

262

association between stenoparib treatment and decreased virus counts soon after infection. This
may reflect activity against multiple targets, including those involved in promoting virus entry.

Stenoparib interference with the activity of tankyrase and Wnt/b-catenin signaling can
downregulate expression of the ACE2 receptor, leading to a decrease in the number of viruses

266

that can enter the cell, which is consistent with effects on virus entry and with our observations.
In contrast, inhibition by remdesivir was predominately on post-entry events – its effect on virus

268

entry was minimal at best, which is in line with its specific MOA of targeting the virus
replication machinery. Overall, our observations imply multiple mechanisms for stenoparib,

270

including impeding of viral entry and intracellular growth via modifications of multiple viral and
host proteins.

272

Other human coronaviruses that utilize ACE2 for binding and entry may be suitable as
surrogate platforms for the study of SARS-CoV-2 in vitro, so long as they can be propagated in

274

the laboratory and are able to elicit cellular infection phenotypes that can be quantitatively
measured. We show that the human seasonal coronavirus NL63, which can cause a cold-like

276

illness in humans (26), is such an example. Like SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV, NL63 is
internalized following the binding of viral S-complex proteins to the ACE2 receptor (28, 47-49).

278

According to our observations, NL63 is susceptible to inhibition by compounds that affect
SARS-CoV-2, including remdesivir, the protease inhibitors camostat mesylate and E64d, and

280

stenoparib, the subject of this study.
In light of the in vitro cytotoxic effects of stenoparib, we were unable to test it in Vero E6

282

cells against SARS-CoV-2 at doses exceeding 30 µM. Stenoparib was developed as a cytotoxic
drug for cancer treatment (14), so it is not surprising that it showed dose-dependent cytotoxicity

284

against rapidly-dividing Vero E6 cells. PARP inhibitors typically express their lethality after
several replication cycles (50). The susceptibility of Vero E6 cells to stenoparib toxicity may be

286

linked to its fast-growing phenotype, since two replication cycles can be achieved in as little as

15

48 h. Although LLC-MK2 cells, which are utilized for propagation and testing of NL63 are
288

substantially more resistant to stenoparib, their susceptibility to SARS-CoV-2 infection is
suboptimal. We were thus presented with a conundrum in how to test high doses of stenoparib

290

against SARS-CoV-2 to assess its maximum activity. This was addressed through the use of the
Calu-3 human lung carcinoma cell line to model SARS-CoV-2 infections. Our results confirm

292

the suitability of Calu-3 as a host for SARS-CoV-2 and its high degree of resistance to stenoparib
toxicity. This characteristic of Calu-3 cells was predicted in silico using a method previously

294

employed on clinical tumor biopsies (22), and experimentally validated in this study. Infection of
Calu-3 monolayers with SARS-CoV-2 formed large, clearly visible plaques, and in this regard,

296

the performance of Calu-3 surpassed Vero E6. A notable characteristic of Calu-3 is its slow
growth properties, which may coincide with a general degree of resistance to compounds that

298

target essential cellular pathways and are toxic to more rapidly dividing cells.
A promising drug to emerge from COVID therapeutic trials is the nucleoside analog

300

remdesivir, which shows activity against phylogenetically diverse viruses including Ebola,
Nipah, respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), and coronaviruses such as SARS- and MERS-CoV

302

(51), SARS-CoV-2 (31) and, as reported here, the seasonal human HCoV-NL63. Reviews on the
MOA of remdesivir have been published (17, 41, 51). After entering the cell, remdesivir is triple

304

phosphorylated to form remdesivir-triphosphate, and this structure is thought to inhibit RNA
polymerase, resulting in chain termination. While the precise molecular mechanism is not clear

306

(51), the EC50 of remdesivir has been reported to be 0.77 µM for SARS-CoV-2 (31), which is in
line with our measurement of 0.54 µM for SARS-CoV-2, and comparable to our experimentally-

308

determined EC50 of 0.46 µM against NL63.

While remdesivir inhibits the viral replicon, our data support multiple targets for
310

stenoparib. Moreover, stenoparib and remdesivir may be a potent combination at inhibiting
SARS-family coronaviruses inside cells. A mixture of 10 µM stenoparib and 0.5 µM remdesivir

312

was more successful at inhibiting the NL63 virus than either compound alone at these doses.
Considering their distinct mechanisms and high potency, a combination of remdesivir and

314

stenoparib is likely to produce a synergistic effect on additional SARS-family coronaviruses,
including SARS-CoV-2. Studies involving this combination in susceptible COVID-19 animal

316

models are in line for efficacy testing.

Materials and Methods
320

The antiviral activity of stenoparib in vitro was assessed against the novel coronavirus
SARS-CoV-2 isolate USA-WA1/2020 (BEI Resources, NIAID, NIH: SARS-Related

322

Coronavirus 2, Isolate USA-WA1/2020, NR-52281) and human coronavirus strain HCoV_NL63
(BEI Resources, NIAID, NIH NR-470). We used Vero E6 (ATCC CRL-1586) and Calu-3 cells

324

(ATCC HTB-55) from the American Type Culture Collection (ATCC, Manassas, VA, USA) in
EMEM (Eagle’s Minimum Essential Medium) supplemented with 2% or 10% fetal bovine serum

326

(FBS), 100 U/mL penicillin, 100 µg/mL streptomycin ‘pen-strep’, 0.01 M HEPES, 1 mM
sodium pyruvate, 1x non-essential amino acids solution (SH3023801, Thermo Fisher), and 2 mM

328

L-glutamine, for the propagation and experimentation with SARS-CoV-2. LLC-MK2 cells
(ATCC CCL-7), maintained in Medium 199 (M4530, Millipore Sigma) supplemented with FBS

330

and pen-strep, were used for the experiments with the NL63 coronavirus. Inhibition of viral
replication was assessed using reverse-transcription quantitative real-time PCR (RT-qPCR) to

332

measure the number of virions released into the cellular supernatant.
Plaque assays. 6-well plates (CLS3516, Millipore Sigma) were seeded with ~3.0x10^5

334

cells/well and incubated for 48-72 h at 37°C in 5% CO2 until 80-90% confluency was reached.
Calu-3 cells were incubated for >10 days to achieve 80-90% confluency. Prior to infection the

336

media was replaced with fresh media containing 2.0% FBS with varying concentrations of
stenoparib as appropriate for each experiment (see results) and infected with coronavirus (SARS-

338

CoV-2 or NL63) at an MOI of 0.013 for SARs-CoV-2 and 0.003 for NL63. Media was then
replaced with a 1 X Dulbecco’s MEM (DMEM - Millipore Sigma) / 1.2% low-melting agarose

340

(Bio-Rad) overlay containing the appropriate drug concentration for each experiment. This was
allowed to solidify at room temperature for 15 minutes, and incubated for 120 h at 37°C in a 5%

342

CO2 atmosphere. A cocktail of the protease inhibitors camostat mesylate and E64d (C/E) was a
control for all experiments (21). SARS-CoV-2 manipulations were conducted in a BSL-3

344

facility. 2.0 ml of 4% paraformaldehyde was added to each overlay for 30 minutes, followed by
staining with 1.0% crystal violet, removal of the overlay, and a triple rinse with PBS. Plaque

346

forming units (pfu) were counted, averaged, and normalized to the untreated control group. Each
run contained three biological replicates and was conducted a minimum of two times. Standard

348

deviation was calculated using the variation of averaged counts among all runs. Values were
plotted using GraphPad Prism version 8.0.0 for Windows (GraphPad Software) and annotated

350

using Adobe Illustrator (Adobe Systems Incorporated). Statistical significance was determined
using a parametric unpaired t-test in GraphPad Prism version 8.0.0.

352

RT-qPCR: Infection and viral RNA extraction. 12-well plates (CLS3513, Millipore
Sigma) were seeded with ~1.0x10^5 cells/well and incubated until 80-90% confluency was

354

reached. Growth media was replaced and infected with coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2 or NL63) at
an MOI of 0.04 for SARs-CoV-2 and 0.01 for NL63 for up to 120 h at 37°C in 5% CO2

356

atmosphere. C/E was used as a control inhibitor for all experiments. Each run contained two
biological replicates and was conducted three times. 400 µL of supernatant was harvested at 48 h

358

for SARS-CoV-2, 120 h for NL63. RNA was extracted using Invitrogen Pure-Link RNA kits
(Thermo Fisher) according to their recommendations.

360

RT-qPCR: Signature identification and qPCR assay design. Two TaqMan qPCR
assays were designed for the SARS-CoV-2 or the NL63 coronaviruses. For NL63, the reference

362

genome (NC_005831) was divided into 200 nucleotide fragments, which were aligned against a
set of 2,771 coronavirus genomes with BLAT v36.2 (52) in conjunction with LS-BSR v1.2.2

364

(53). Regions were identified that had a BLAST score ratio (BSR) (54) value ≥0.8 in 60 NL63

genomes, and a BSR value <0.4 in all other coronavirus genomes. A total of 10 fragments were
366

highly specific to all NL63 genomes. Primers and probes were identified using Primer3 v2.3.6
(55). A similar process was conducted for SARS-CoV-2 assay design, except the

368

GCF_009858895.2 reference genome was used. A total of 4 fragments were unique to 64 distinct
SARS-CoV-2 genomes. A probe was designed targeting the spike (S) protein furin cleavage site

370

with Primer3.
The SARS-CoV-2 qPCR amplified a 125 bp region of the S protein using forward primer

372

CoV2-S_19F (5’-GCTGAACATGTCAACAACTC-3’) and reverse primer CoV2-S_143R (5’GCAATGATGGATTGACTAGC-3’) with MGB TaqMan probe CoV2-S_93FP (5’-

374

ACTAATTCTCCTCGGCGGGC-3’) labeled with FAM dye, which was designed based off the
SARS-CoV-2 genome GCF_009858895.2 (GenBank: MN908947.3), while the NL63 qPCR

376

amplified a 191 bp region of a membrane protein (GenBank: YP_003770.1) using forward
primer NL63_10F (5’-TGGTCGCTCTGTTAATGAAA-3’) and reverse primer NL63_200R (5’-

378

AAATTTCTTCCTAGCAGCTC-3’) with MGB TaqMan probe NL63_102RP (5’CCCTCCTGAGAGGCAACACC-3’), labeled with a VIC dye, which was based off the

380

HCoV_NL63 genome (GenBank: MN306040.1).
RT-qPCR: Reverse transcription and PCR amplification. We initially used a two-step

382

method where viral RNA was converted into cDNA using Invitrogen SuperScript IV VILO
Master Mix (11766500, Thermo Fisher) in 96-well format (18021-014, Thermo Fisher); in a

384

SimpliAmp® thermocycler (Applied Biosystems). 1 µL of template cDNA was then subjected to
qPCR in 10 µL reactions containing 1x TaqMan Universal Master Mix II (w/o AmpERASE

386

UNG), with 0.2 µM of each forward and reverse primer and 0.1 µM of probe for the SARSCoV-2 qPCR and 0.25 µM of each forward and reverse primer and 0.125 µM of probe for the

NL63 qPCR). Amplification was performed in triplicate using either a QuantStudio 7 flex or
QuantStudio 12K (Applied Biosystems) utilizing: 10’ at 95°C, then 40 X at 95°C 15”, 60°C for

390

1’. Another approach employed a one-step procedure in which viral RNA was converted to
cDNA using the TaqMan primers, followed by qPCR (4x Reliance One-Step Multiplex RT-

392

qPCR Supermix) with the same primers, probes, and concentrations as for the two-step approach.
Triplicate reactions were performed using QuantStudio under the following conditions: 50°C for

394

10’; 95°C, 10’; 40 cycles of 95°C 10” and 60°C 30”. Positive amplification and non-template
controls were included on every run.

396

RT-qPCR: Data analysis. Synthetic double-stranded DNA fragments were generated
(gBlocks Gene Fragments, Integrated DNA Technologies) as qPCR controls, and contained

398

amplification primers for either SARS-CoV-2 or NL63 targets, and were elongated to 200 bp.
These gBlocks were resuspended according to the manufacturer’s protocol and quantified using a

400

Qubit 4 fluorometer with a dsDNA HS assay kit (Q32851 Thermo Fisher), then normalized to
10^8 copies per µL. Using serial dilution, we were able to extrapolate viral copy number in each

402

of the experimental samples. Based on these standards, the QuantStudio instrument software
generated a curve to quantify sample reactions. The calculated quantities for each sample were

404

averaged, and the standard deviation was calculated among reactions. Values for the
experimental replicates and the standard deviations among experimental runs were averaged, and

406

then normalized to the untreated control group to obtain percent inhibition values. These were
plotted using GraphPad Prism version 8.0.0 for Windows and annotations were added using

408

Adobe Illustrator. Where appropriate, statistical significance was determined using a parametric
unpaired t-test in GraphPad Prism version 8.0.0.

Cytotoxicity. Cytotoxicity was measured using the Promega™ CytoTox 96™
Nonradioactive Cytotoxicity Assay kit (G1780) in 50 µL reactions according to the

412

manufacturer’s protocol. The absorbance at 490 nm (A490) was measured using a BioTeK

Time of addition experiments. For the full-time experiments, virus, drug and cells were
incubated for 1 h. Media was then replaced with fresh media containing the drug. Entry

418

experiments were pretreated with drug for 1 h and then infected with virus for an additional hour,
followed by media replacement that lacked drug. Post-entry experiments utilized cells that were

Fig. 6. Stenoparib and remdesivir in combination is a potent inhibitor of NL63. Plaque
assays were performed a minimum of two times and replicate values from each run were
averaged. Plaquing efficiency values are normalized as a percentage of inhibition compared to
infected, but untreated cells. Three data sets are plotted to illustrate the treatment of NL63 with
1) stenoparib and 2) remdesivir as monotherapies and as a 3) combination therapy, whereby
increasing concentrations of stenoparib are combined with 0.5 µM remdesivir; the EC50 was
computationally approximated at 0.46 µM. The stenoparib monotherapy data is the same as
previously reported (Fig. 4A). The synergistic activity threshold is defined as the sum of the
mean values of 10 µM stenoparib and 0.5 µM remdesivir as monotherapies, while the grey
highlighted area represents the minimum and maximum possible additive activity values based
on the range of error for those same concentrations observed during these experiments.

Fig. S1. Stenoparib inhibits plaque formation in Calu-3 cells. Plaque assays were performed
using Calu-3 cells infected with SARS-CoV-2 and treated with varying concentrations of
stenoparib. Plaques are identified as empty regions or “dead zones” in the cellular monolayer and
are expressed as plaque forming units (PFUs) per well. Plaques were manually counted and
averaged among experimental replicates. This score is normalized as a percentage of untreated,
but infected cells. In this representative image of the SARS-CoV-2/Calu-3 experiment, plaques
are dark scars on the cellular monolayer. Controls were 1) uninfected cells (Cell Ctl), 2)
untreated, but infected cells (0 µM), and 3) a camostat mesylate and E64d (C/E) inhibitor control
(Inhibitor Ctl). Treatment with stenoparib at 10 µM and 30 µM led to a marked reduction in
plaquing efficiency, whereas 60 µM resulted in near complete inhibition.
