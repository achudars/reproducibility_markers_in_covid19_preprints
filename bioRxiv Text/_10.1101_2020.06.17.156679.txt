Abstract

17

Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is the etiological cause of the

18

coronavirus disease 2019, for which no effective therapeutics are available. The SARS-CoV-2 main

19

protease (Mpro) is essential for viral replication and constitutes a promising therapeutic target. Many

20

efforts aimed at deriving effective Mpro inhibitors are currently underway, including an international

21

open-science discovery project, codenamed COVID Moonshot. As part of COVID Moonshot, we used

22

saturation transfer difference nuclear magnetic resonance (STD-NMR) spectroscopy to assess the

23

binding of putative Mpro ligands to the viral protease, including molecules identified by

24

crystallographic fragment screening and novel compounds designed as Mpro inhibitors. In this

25

manner, we aimed to complement enzymatic activity assays of Mpro performed by other groups with

26

information on ligand affinity. We have made the Mpro STD-NMR data publicly available. Here, we

27

provide detailed information on the NMR protocols used and challenges faced, thereby placing these

28

data into context. Our goal is to assist the interpretation of Mpro STD-NMR data, thereby accelerating

29

ongoing drug design efforts.

Introduction

33

Infections by the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) resulted in

34

approximately 1.8 million deaths in 2020 (1) and led to the coronavirus 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic

35

(2-4). SARS-CoV-2 is a zoonotic betacoronavirus highly similar to SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, which

36

caused outbreaks in 2002 and 2012, respectively (5-7). SARS-CoV-2 encodes its proteome in a single,

37

positive-sense, linear RNA molecule of ~30 kb length, the majority of which (~21.5 kb) is translated

38

into two polypeptides, pp1a and pp1ab, via ribosomal frame-shifting (8, 9). Key viral enzymes and

39

factors, including most proteins of the reverse-transcriptase machinery, inhibitors of host translation

40

and molecules signalling for host cell survival, are released from pp1a and pp1ab via post-

41

translational cleavage by two viral cysteine proteases (10). These proteases, a papain-like enzyme

42

cleaving pp1ab at three sites, and a 3C-like protease cleaving the polypeptide at 11 sites, are primary

43

targets for the development of antiviral drugs.

44

The 3C-like protease of SARS-CoV-2, also known as the viral main protease (Mpro), has been the

45

target of intense study owing to its centrality in viral replication. Mpro studies have benefited from

46

previous structural analyses of the SARC-CoV 3C-like protease and the earlier development of

47

putative inhibitors (11-14). The active sites of these proteases are highly conserved, and

48

peptidomimetic inhibitors active against Mpro are also potent against the SARS-CoV 3C-like protease

49

(15, 16). However, to date no Mpro-targeting inhibitors have been validated in clinical trials. In order

50

to accelerate Mpro inhibitor development, an international, crowd-funded, open-science project was

51

formed under the banner of COVID Moonshot (17), combining high-throughput crystallographic

52

screening (18), computational chemistry, enzymatic activity assays and mass spectroscopy (19)

53

among the many methodologies contributed by collaborating groups.

54

As part of COVID Moonshot, we utilised saturation transfer difference nuclear magnetic

55

resonance (STD-NMR) spectroscopy (20-22) to investigate the Mpro binding of ligands initially

56

identified by crystallographic screening, as well as molecules designed specifically as non-covalent

57

inhibitors of this protease. Our goal was to provide orthogonal information on ligand binding to that

58

which could be gained by enzymatic activity assays conducted in parallel by other groups. STD-NMR

59

is a proven method for characterising the binding of small molecules to biological macromolecules,

60

able to provide both quantitative affinity information and structural data on the proximity of ligand

61

chemical groups to the protein. Here, we provide detailed documentation on the NMR protocols

62

used to record these data and highlight the advantages, limitations and assumptions underpinning

63

our approach. Our aim is to assist the comparison of Mpro STD-NMR data with other quantitative

64

measurements, and facilitate the consideration of these data when designing future Mpro inhibitors.

Materials and Methods

66

Protein production and purification

67

We created a SARS-CoV-2 Mpro genetic construct in pFLOAT vector (23), encoding for the viral

68

protease and an N-terminal His6-tag separated by a modified human rhinovirus (HRV) 3C protease

69

recognition site, designed to reconstitute a native Mpro N-terminus upon HRV 3C cleavage. The Mpro

70

construct was transformed into Escherichia coli strain Rosetta(DE3) (Novagen) and transformed

71

clones were pre-cultured at 37 °C for 5 h in lysogeny broth supplemented with appropriate

72

antibiotics. Starter cultures were used to inoculate 1 L of Terrific Broth Autoinduction Media

73

(Formedium) supplemented with 10% v/v glycerol and appropriate antibiotics. Cell cultures were

74

grown at 37 °C for 5 h and then cooled to 18 °C for 12 h. Bacterial cells were harvested by

75

centrifugation at 5,000 x g for 15 min.

76

Cell pellets were resuspended in 50 mM trisaminomethane (Tris)-Cl pH 8, 300 mM NaCl, 10 mM

77

imidazole buffer, incubated with 0.05 mg/ml benzonase nuclease (Sigma Aldrich) and lysed by

78

sonication on ice. Lysates were clarified by centrifugation at 50,000 x g at 4 °C for 1 h. Lysate

79

supernatants were loaded onto a HiTrap Talon metal affinity column (GE Healthcare) pre-

80

equilibrated with lysis buffer. Column wash was performed with 50 mM Tris-Cl pH 8, 300 mM NaCl

81

and 25 mM imidazole, followed by protein elution using the same buffer and an imidazole gradient

82

from 25 to 500 mM concentration. The His6-tag was cleaved using home-made HRV 3C protease. The

83

HRV 3C protease, His6-tag and further impurities were removed by a reverse HiTrap Talon column.

84

Flow-through fractions were concentrated and applied to a Superdex75 26/600 size exclusion

85

column (GE Healthcare) equilibrated in NMR buffer (150 mM NaCl, 20 mM Na2HPO4 pH 7.4).

86
87

Nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy

88

All NMR experiments were performed using a 950 MHz solution-state instrument comprising an

89

Oxford Instruments superconducting magnet, Bruker Avance III console and TCI probehead. A Bruker

90

SampleJet sample changer was used for sample manipulation. Experiments were performed and

91

data processed using TopSpin (Bruker). For direct STD-NMR measurements, samples comprised 10

92

μM Mpro and variable concentrations (20 μM – 4 mM) of ligand compounds formulated in NMR

93

buffer supplemented with 10% v/v D2O and deuterated dimethyl sulfoxide (D6-DMSO, 99.96% D,

94

Sigma Aldrich) to 5% v/v final D6-DMSO concentration. In competition experiments, samples

95

comprised 2 μM Mpro, 0.8 mM of ligand x0434 and variable concentrations (0 – 20 μM) of competing

96

compound in NMR buffer supplemented with D2O and D6-DMSO as above. Sample volume was 140

97

μL and samples were loaded in 3 mm outer diameter SampleJet NMR tubes (Bruker) placed in 96-

98

tube racks. NMR tubes were sealed with POM balls.

99

STD-NMR experiments were performed at 10 oC using a pulse sequence described previously (20)

100

and an excitation sculpting water-suppression scheme (24). Protein signals were suppressed in STD-

101

NMR by the application of a 30 msec spin-lock pulse. We collected time-domain data of 16,384

102

complex points and 41.6 μsec dwell time (12.02 kHz sweepwidth). Data were collected in an

103

interleaved pattern, with on- and off-resonance irradiation data separated into 16 blocks of 16

104

transients each (256 total transients per irradiation frequency). Transient recycle delay was 4 sec and

105

on- or off-resonance irradiation was performed using 0.1 mW of power for 3.5 sec at 0.5 ppm or 26

106

ppm, respectively, for a total experiment time of approximately 50 minutes. Reconstructed time-

107

domain data from the difference of on- and off-resonance irradiation (STD spectra) or only the off-

108

resonance irradiation (reference spectra) were processed by applying a 2 Hz exponential line

109

broadening function and 2-fold zero-filling prior to Fourier transformation. Phasing parameters were

110

derived for each sample from the reference spectra and copied to the STD spectra. 1H peak

111

intensities were integrated in TopSpin using a local-baseline adjustment function. Data fitting to

112

extract Kd values were performed in OriginPro (OriginLab). The folded state of Mpro in the presence

113

of each ligand was verified by collecting 1H NMR spectra similar to Fig. 1A from all samples ahead of

114

STD-NMR experiments.

115
116

Ligand handling

117

Compounds for the initial STD-NMR assessment of crystallographic fragment binding to Mpro were

118

provided by the XChem group at Diamond Light Source in the form of a 384-well plated library (DSI-

119

poised, Enamine), with compounds dissolved in D6-DMSO at 500 mM nominal concentration. 1 μL of

120

dissolved compounds was aspirated from this library and immediately mixed with 9 μL of D6-DMSO

121

for a final fragment concentration of 50 mM, from which NMR samples were formulated. For

122

titrations of the same crystallographic fragments compounds were procured directly from Enamine

123

in the form of lyophilized powder, which was dissolved in D6-DMSO to derive compound stocks at 10

124

mM and 100 mM concentrations for NMR sample formulation.

125

STD-NMR assays of bespoke Mpro ligands used compounds commercially synthesised for COVID

126

Moonshot. These ligands were provided to us by the XChem group in 96-well plates, containing 0.7

127

μL of 20 mM D6-DMSO-disolved compound per well. Plates were created using an Echo liquid

128

handling robot (Labcyte) and immediately sealed and frozen at -20 oC. For use, ligand plates were

129

thoroughly defrosted at room temperature and spun at 3,500 g for 5 minutes. In single-

130

concentration STD-NMR experiments, 140 μL of a pre-formulated mixture of Mpro and NMR buffer

131

with D2O and D6-DMSO were added to each well to create the final NMR sample. For STD-NMR

132

competition experiments, 0.5 μL of ligands were aspirated from the plates and immediately mixed

133

with 19.5 μL of D6-DMSO for final ligand concentration of 0.5 mM from which NMR samples were

134

formulated.

136

Molecular dynamics (MD) simulations

137

The monomeric complexes of Mpro bound to chemical fragments were obtained from the RCSB

138

Protein Data Bank entries 5R81 (ligand x0195), 5REB (x0387), 5RGI (x0397), 5RGK (x0426), 5R83

139

(x0434) and 5REH (x0540) for MD simulations with GROMACS version 2018 (25) and the

140

AMBER99SB-ILDN force field (26). All complexes were inserted in a pre-equilibrated box containing

141

water implemented using the TIP3P water model (26). Force field parameters for the six ligands

142

were generated using the general Amber force field and HF/6 – 31G*– derived RESP atomic charges

143

(27). The reference system consisted of the protein, the ligand, ~31,400 water molecules, 95 Na and

144

95 Cl ions in a 100 x 100 x 100 Å simulation box, resulting in a total number of ~98,000 atoms. Each

145

system was energy-minimized and subsequently subjected to a 20 ns MD equilibration, with an

146

isothermal-isobaric ensemble using isotropic pressure control (28), and positional restraints on

147

protein and ligand coordinates. The resulting equilibrated systems were replicated 4 times and

148

independent 200 ns MD trajectories were produced with a time step of 2 fs, in constant temperature

149

of 300 K, using separate v-rescale thermostats (28) for the protein, ligand and solvent molecules.

150

Lennard-Jones interactions were computed using a cut-oﬀ of 10 Å and electrostac interacons were

151

treated using particle mesh Ewald (29) with the same real-space cut-off. Analysis on the resulting

152

trajectories was performed using MDAnalysis (30, 31). Structures were visualised using PyMOL (32).

STD-NMR assays of Mpro ligand binding

160

Mpro forms dimers in crystals via an extensive interaction interface involving two domains (15).

161

Mpro dimers likely have a sub-μM solution dissociation constant (Kd) by analogy to previously studied

162

3C-like coronavirus proteases (34). At the 10 μM protein concentration of our NMR assays Mpro is,

163

thus, expected to be dimeric with an estimated molecular weight of nearly 70 kDa. Despite the

164

relatively large size of Mpro for solution NMR, 1H spectra of the protease readily showed the presence

165

of multiple up-field shifted (<0.5 ppm) peaks corresponding to protein methyl groups (Fig. 1A). In

166

addition to demonstrating that Mpro is folded under the conditions tested, these spectra allowed us

167

to identify the chemical shifts of Mpro methyl groups that may be suitable for on-resonance

168

irradiation in STD-NMR experiments. Trials with on-resonance irradiation applied to different methyl

169

group peaks showed that irradiating at 0.5 ppm (Fig. 1A) produced the strongest STD signal from

170

ligands in the presence of Mpro, while simultaneously avoiding ligand excitation that would yield

171

false-positive signals in the absence of Mpro (Fig. 1B). Further, we noted that small molecules

172

abundant in the samples but not binding specifically to Mpro, such as DMSO, produced pseudo-

173

dispersive residual signal lineshapes in STD spectra, while true Mpro ligands produced peaks in STD

174

with absorptive 1H lineshapes. We surmised that STD-NMR is suitable for screening ligand binding to

175

Mpro, requiring relatively small amounts (10-50 μgr) of protein and time (under 1 hour) per sample

176

studied.

177

The strength of STD signal is quantified by calculating the ratio of integrated signal intensity of

178

peaks in the STD spectrum over that of the reference spectrum (STDratio). The STDratio factor is

179

inversely proportional to ligand Kd, as ܵܶ‫ܦ‬௥௔௧௜௢ ‫ ן‬௄

180

Measuring STDratio values over a range of ligand concentrations allows fitting of the proportionality

181

constant and calculation of ligand Kd. However, time and sample-amount considerations, including

182

the limited availability of bespoke compounds synthesized for the COVID Moonshot project, made

183

recording full STD-NMR titrations impractical for screening hundreds of ligands. Thus, we evaluated

184

whether measuring the STDratio value at a single ligand concentration may be an informative

185

alternative to Kd, provided restraints could be placed, for example, on the proportionality constant.

where [L] is ligand concentration.

186

Theoretical and practical considerations suggested that three parameters influence our

187

evaluation of single-concentration STDratio values towards an affinity context. Firstly, the STDratio

188

factor is affected by the efficiency of NOE magnetisation transfer between protein and ligand, which

189

in turn depends on the proximity of ligand and protein groups, and the chemical nature of these

190

groups (20-22). To minimize the influence of these factors across diverse ligands, we sought to

191

quantify the STDratio of only aromatic ligand groups, and only consider those showing the strongest

192

STD signal; thus, that are in closest proximity to the protein. Second, STD-NMR assays require ligand

193

exchange between protein-bound and -free states in the timeframe of the experiment; strongly

194

bound compounds that dissociate very slowly from the protein would yield reduced STDratio values

195

compared to weaker ligands that dissociate more readily. Structures of Mpro with many different

196

ligands show that the protein conformation does not change upon complex formation and that the

197

active site is fully solvent-exposed (18), which suggests that ligand association can proceed with high

198

rate (107 – 108 M-1s-1). Under this assumption, the ligand dissociation rate is the primary determinant

199

of interaction strength. Given the duration of the STD-NMR experiment in our assays, and the ratios

200

of ligand:protein used, we estimated that significant protein – ligand exchange will take place even

201

for interactions as strong as low-μM Kd. Finally, uncertainties or errors in nominal ligand

202

concentration skew the correlation of STDratio to compound affinities; as shown in Fig. S1, STDratio

203

values increase strongly when very small amounts of ligands are assessed. Thus, overly large STDratio

204

values may be measured if ligand concentrations are significantly lower than anticipated.

205
206

Quantitating Mpro binding of ligands identified by crystallographic screening

207

Mindful of the limitations inherent to measuring single-concentration STDratio values, and prior to

208

using STD-NMR to evaluate bespoke Mpro ligands, we used this method to assess binding to the

209

protease of small chemical fragments identified in crystallographic screening experiments (18). In

210

crystallographic screening campaigns of other target proteins such fragments were seen to have

211

very weak affinities (> 1 mM Kd, e.g. (35)), thereby satisfying the exchange criterion set out above. 39

212

non-covalent Mpro interactors are part of the DSI-poised fragment library to which we were given

213

access, comprising 17 active site binders, two compounds targeting the Mpro dimerisation interface

214

and 20 molecules binding elsewhere on the protein surface (18). We initially recorded STD-NMR

215

spectra from these compounds in the absence of Mpro to confirm that we obtained no or minimal

216

STD signal when protease is omitted, and to verify ligand identity from reference 1H spectra. Five

217

ligands gave no solution NMR signal or produced reference 1H spectra inconsistent with the

218

compound chemical structure; these ligands were not evaluated further. Samples of 10 μM Mpro and

219

0.8 mM nominal ligand concentration were then formulated from the remaining 34 compounds

220

(Table S1), and STD-NMR spectra were recorded, from which only aromatic ligand STD signals were

221

considered for further analysis.

222

We observed large variations in STD signal intensity and STDratio values in the presence of Mpro

223

across compounds (Fig. 2A,B; Table S1), with many ligands producing little or no STD signal,

224

suggesting substantial differences in compound affinity for the protease. However, we also noted

225

that ligand reference spectra different substantially in intensity (Fig. 2C), despite compounds being

226

at the same nominal concentration. Integrating ligand peaks in these reference spectra revealed

227

differences in per-1H intensity of up to ~15-fold, indicating significant variation of ligand

228

concentrations in solution (Table S1). Such concentration differences could arise from errors in

229

sample formulation or from concentration inconsistencies in the compound library. To evaluate the

230

former we also integrated the residual 1H signal of D6-DMSO in our reference spectra, and found it to

231

vary by less than 35% across any pair of samples (11% average deviation). As DMSO was added

232

alongside ligands in our samples, we concluded that sample formulation may have contributed

233

errors in compound concentration of up to ~1/3, but did not account for the ~15-fold differences in

234

concentration observed.

235

Given that differences in compound concentration can skew the relative STDratio values of ligands

236

(Fig. S1), and that such concentration differences were also observed among newly designed Mpro

237

inhibitors (see below), we questioned whether recording STDratio values under these conditions can

238

provide useful information. To address this question we attempted to quantify the affinity of

239

crystallographic fragments to Mpro, selecting ligands that showed clear differences in STDratio values

240

in the assays above and focusing on compounds binding at the Mpro active site; hence, that are of

241

potential interest to inhibitor development. We performed Mpro binding titrations monitored by STD-

242

NMR of compounds x0195, x0354, x0426 and x0434 in 50 μM – 4 mM concentrations (Fig. S2), and

243

noted that only compounds x0434 and x0195, which show the highest STDratio (Fig. 2A), bound

244

strongly enough for an affinity constant to be estimated (Kd of 1.6 ± 0.2 mM and 1.7 ± 0.2 mM,

245

respectively). In contrast, the titrations of x0354 and x0426, which yielded lower STDratio values,

246

could not be fit to extract a Kd indicating weaker binding to Mpro.

247

To further this analysis, we assessed the binding of fragments x0195, x0387, x0397, x0426, x0434

248

and x0540 to the Mpro active site using quadruplicate atomistic molecular dynamics (MD) simulations

249

of 200 nsec duration. As shown in Fig. S3A,B, and Movies S1 and S2, fragments with high STDradio

250

values (x0434 and x0195) always located in the Mpro active site despite exchanging between

251

different binding conformations (Fig. S4), with average ligand root-mean-square-deviation (RMSD) of

252

3.2 Å and 5.1 Å respectively after the first 100 nsec of simulation. Medium STDratio value fragments

253

(x0426 and x0540, Fig. S3C,D, and Movies S3 and S4) show average RMSDs of approximately 9 Å in

254

the same simulation timeframe, frequently exchanging to alternative binding poses and with x0540

255

occasionally exiting the Mpro active site. In contrast, fragments showing very little STD NMR signal

uncertainties in ligand amounts, STDratio values recorded at single compound concentration can act

260

as proxy measurements of Mpro affinity for ligands.

261
262

Assessment of Mpro binding by COVID Moonshot ligands

263

We proceeded to characterise by STD-NMR the Mpro binding of bespoke ligands created as part of

264

the COVID Moonshot project and designed to act as non-covalent inhibitors of the protease (17).

265

Similar to the assays of crystallographic fragments above, we focused our analysis of STD signals to

266

aromatic moieties of ligands binding to the Mpro active side and extracted STDratio values only from

267

the strongest STD peaks. Once again, we noted substantial differences in apparent compound

268

concentrations, judging from reference 1H spectral intensities (Fig. 3A), which could not be

269

attributed to errors in sample preparation as the standard deviation of residual 1H intensity in the

270

D6-DMSO peak did not exceed 5% in any of the ligand batches tested. Crucially, out of 650 different

271

molecules tested, samples of 35 compounds (7.6%) contained no ligand and 86 (13.2%) very little

272

ligand (Fig. 3A). In these cases, NMR assays were repeated using a separate batch of compound;

273

however, 96.2% of repeat experiments yielded the same outcome of no or very little ligand in the

274

NMR samples.

275

We measured STDratio values from samples were ligands produced sufficiently strong reference 1H

276

NMR spectra to be readily visible, and deposited these values and associated raw NMR data to the

277

Collaborative Drug Discovery database (33). Some of these ligands were assessed independently for

278

enzymatic inhibition of Mpro using a mass spectroscopy method as part of the COVID Moonshot

279

collaboration (17). Where both parameters are available, we compared the STDratio values and 50%

280

inhibition concentrations (IC50) of these ligands. As shown in Fig. 3B, STDratio and IC50 values show

281

weak correlation (R2=30%) for most ligands tested; however, a subset of ligands displayed

282

conspicuously low or even no STD signals considering their effect on Mpro activity, and presented

283

themselves as outliers in the correlation graph. As these outlier ligands had IC50 values below 10 μM,

284

suggesting that their affinities to the protease may be in the μM Kd region, we considered whether

285

our approach gives rise to false-negative STD results, for example through slow ligand dissociation

286

from Mpro.

287

To address this question, we derived an assay whereby the bespoke, high-affinity Mpro inhibitor

288

would outcompete a lower-affinity ligand known to provide strong STD signal from the protease

289

active site. In these experiments the lower-affinity ligand would act as ‘spy’ molecule whose STD

290

signal reduces as function of inhibitor concentration. We used fragment x0434, which yields

291

substantial STD signal with Mpro (Fig. 1B and 2A), as ‘spy’, and tested protease inhibitors EDJ-MED-

292

a364e151-1, LON-WEI-ff7b210a-5, CHO-MSK-6e55470f-14 and LOR-NOR-30067bb9-11 as x0434

293

competitors. Of these inhibitors, EDJ-MED-a364e151-1 gave rise to substantial STD signal in earlier

294

assays, whereas the remaining produced little or no STD signal; yet, all four inhibitors were reported

295

to have low-μM or sub-μM IC50 values based on Mpro enzymatic assays. In these competition

296

experiments, both EDJ-MED-a364e151-1 and LON-WEI-ff7b210a-5 yielded Kd parameters

297

comparable to the reported IC50 values (Fig. S5A,B), showing that at least in the case of LON-WEI-

298

ff7b210a-5 the absence of STD signal in the single-concentration NMR assays above represented a

299

false-negative result. In contrast, CHO-MSK-6e55470f-14 and LOR-NOR-30067bb9-11 were unable to

300

compete x0434 from the protease active site (Fig. S5C,D), suggesting that in these two cases the

301

reported IC50 values do not reflect inhibitor binding to the protease, and that the weak STD signal of

302

the initial assays was a better proxy of affinity. We surmised that although some low STDratio values

303

of Mpro inhibitors may not accurately reflect compound affinity to the protease, such values cannot

304

be discounted as a whole as they may correspond to non-binding ligands.

Discussion

314

Fragment-based screening is a tried and tested method for reducing the number of compounds

315

that need to be assessed for binding against a specific target in order to sample chemical space (36).

316

Combined with X-ray crystallography, which provides information on the target site and binding

317

pose of ligands, initial fragments can quickly be iterated into potent and specifically-interacting

318

compounds. The COVID Moonshot collaboration (17) took advantage of crystallographic fragment-

319

based screening (18) to initiate the design of novel inhibitors targeting the essential main protease

320

of the SARS-CoV-2 coronavirus; however crystallographic structures do not report on ligand affinity

321

and inhibitory potency in enzymatic assays does not always correlate with ligand binding. Thus,

322

supplementing these methods with solution NMR tools highly sensitive to ligand binding can provide

323

a powerful combination of orthogonal information and assurance against false starts.

324

We showed that STD-NMR is a suitable method for characterising ligand binding to Mpro, allowing

325

us to assess ligand interactions using relatively small amounts of protein and in under one hour of

326

experiment time per ligand (Fig. 1B). However, screening compounds in a high-throughput manner is

327

not compatible with the time- and ligand-amount requirements of full STD-NMR titrations. Thus, we

328

resorted to using an unconventional metric, the single-concentration STDratio value, as proxy for

329

ligand affinity. Although this metric has limitations due to its dependency on magnetisation transfer

330

between protein and ligand, and on relatively rapid exchange between the ligand-free and -bound

331

states, we demonstrated that it can nevertheless be informative. Specifically, the relative STDratio

332

values of chemical fragments bound to the Mpro active site provided insight on fragment affinity (Fig.

333

2A), as crosschecked by quantitative titrations (Fig. S2) and MD simulations (Fig. S3). Furthermore,

334

STDratio values of COVID Moonshot compounds held a weak correlation to enzymatic IC50 parameters

335

(Fig. 3B), although false-negative and -positive results from both methods contribute to multiple

336

outliers. Thus, in our view the biggest limitation of using the single-concentration STDratio value as

337

metric relates to its supra-linear sensitivity to ligand concentration (Fig. S1), which as demonstrated

338

here can vary substantially across ligands in a large project (Fig. 3A).

339

How then should the STD data recorded as part of COVID Moonshot be used? Firstly, we showed

340

that at least for some bespoke Mpro ligands the STDratio value obtained is a better proxy for

341

compound affinity compared to IC50 parameters from enzymatic assays (Fig. S5). This, inherently, is

342

the value of employing orthogonal methods thereby minimizing the number of potential false

343

results. Thus, when one is considering existing Mpro ligands to base the design of future inhibitors, a

344

high STDratio value as well as low IC50 parameters are both desirable. Second, due to the

345

aforementioned limitations of single-concentration STDratio value as proxy of affinity, and the
12

346

influence of uncertainties in ligand concentrations, we believe that comparisons of compounds and

347

derivatives differing by less than ~50% in STDratio is not meaningful. Rather, we propose that the

348

STDratio values of Mpro ligands measured and available at the CDD database should be treated as a

349

qualitative metrics of compound affinity.

350

In conclusion, we presented here protocols for the assessment of SARS-CoV-2 Mpro ligands using

351

STD-NMR spectroscopy, and evaluated the relative qualitative affinities of chemical fragments and

352

compounds designed as part of COVID Moonshot. Although development of novel antivirals to

353

combat COVID-19 is still at an early stage, we hope that this information will prove valuable to

354

groups working towards such treatments.

concentration sample in a 5 mm NMR tube at 25 oC using an excitation sculpting water-suppression

method (24). 512 acquisitions with recycle delay of 1.25 sec were averaged, for a total experiment

spectra, data were processed with a quadratic sine function prior to Fourier transformation. Protein
