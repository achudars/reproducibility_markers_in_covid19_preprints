Background. Morbidity and mortality from COVID-19 caused by novel coronavirus SARS-CoV-2 is
accelerating worldwide and novel clinical presentations of COVID-19 are often reported. The range
of human cells and tissues targeted by SARS-CoV-2, its potential receptors and associated regulating
factors are still largely unknown. The aim of our study was to analyze the expression of known and
potential SARS-CoV-2 receptors and related molecules in the extensive collection of primary human
cells and tissues from healthy subjects of different age and from patients with risk factors and known
comorbidities of COVID-19.

Methods. We performed RNA sequencing and explored available RNA-Seq databases to study gene
expression and co-expression of ACE2, CD147 (BSG), CD26 (DPP4) and their direct and indirect
molecular partners in primary human bronchial epithelial cells, bronchial and skin biopsies,
bronchoalveolar lavage fluid, whole blood, peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs), monocytes,
neutrophils, DCs, NK cells, ILC1, ILC2, ILC3, CD4+ and CD8+ T cells, B cells and plasmablasts. We
analyzed the material from healthy children and adults, and from adults in relation to their disease
or COVID-19 risk factor status.
Results. ACE2 and TMPRSS2 were coexpressed at the epithelial sites of the lung and skin, whereas
CD147 (BSG), cyclophilins (PPIA and PPIB), CD26 (DPP4) and related molecules were expressed in
both, epithelium and in immune cells. We also observed a distinct age-related expression profile of
these genes in the PBMCs and T cells from healthy children and adults. Asthma, COPD, hypertension,
smoking, obesity, and male gender status generally led to the higher expression of ACE2- and CD147related genes in the bronchial biopsy, BAL or blood. Additionally, CD147-related genes correlated
positively with age and BMI. Interestingly, we also observed higher expression of ACE2- and CD147related genes in the lesional skin of patients with atopic dermatitis.
Conclusions. Our data suggest different receptor repertoire potentially involved in the SARS-CoV-2
infection at the epithelial barriers and in the immune cells. Altered expression of these receptors
related with age, gender, obesity and smoking, as well as with the disease status might contribute to
COVID-19 morbidity and severity patterns.

Introduction

83

A novel coronavirus SARS-CoV-2 leading to COVID-19 was identified for the first time in

84

December 2019 and as of today has infected already more than 4.3 million and killed more than 290

85

000 people worldwide (as of 13th of May 2020) 1. SARS-CoV-2 virus has very high genome sequence

86

similarity to two other human coronaviruses SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV 2. Therefore, it is highly

87

possible that SARS-CoV-2 uses similar approaches to cell entry and replication in various cells and

88

tissues. In fact, it is already known that SARS-CoV-2 uses the same receptor ACE2 to enter the cells

89

via its structural spike glycoprotein (S), yet with much higher affinity, which might translate to the

90

massive SARS-CoV-2 spread as compared to SARS-CoV 3. Host transmembrane protease serine 2

91

(TMPRSS2; encoded by TMPRSS2) cleaves spike protein into two subunits, which is a necessary step

92

for the virus fusion to cellular membranes and entry the cell 3. Recent structural studies revealed that

93

this process can be potentially inhibited by B0AT1 (S6A19; encoded by SLC6A19), an amino acid

94

transporter, presence of which may block the access of TMPRSS2 to the cleavage site on ACE2 4 (Table

95

S1).

96

The expression of ACE2 (encoded by ACE2) is very ubiquitous in the lung, heart, kidney and
5,6

97

intestine, but it is rarely expressed in immune cells

. However, immune cells can be potentially

98

infected by SARS-CoV-2, as in case of MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV 7,8. Thus, it is highly possible that there

99

are other receptors for virus entry in different cell types. Indeed, similarly with what has been shown

100

in SARS-CoV, another receptor - CD147, called also basigin (encoded by BSG), has been recently

101

shown to act as a receptor for SARS-CoV-2 in T cell lines and in cell lines of epithelial origin

102

Interestingly, the same receptor is a putative receptor not only for SARS-CoV, but also for HIV-1 and

103

measles, as well as is a receptor for malaria entry to erythrocytes 11-14. An anti-CD147 antibody that

104

blocks infection with SARS-CoV-2 in vitro and its humanized drug (meplazumab) has been already

105

used in a clinical trial in patients with COVID-19 pneumonia. Meplazumab seemed to facilitate viral

106

clearance, return to normal levels of lymphocyte count and decrease in CRP 9,15. The percentage of

107

improvement in patients with severe and critical COVID-19 presentations seemed higher in weekly

108

meplazumab treatment compared to patients on the conventional treatment 15.

9,10

.

109

CD147 is a transmembrane receptor interacting with several extracellular and intracellular

110

partners forming a transmembrane supramolecular complex 16. A group of extracellular molecules

111

can bind and activate CD147 are cyclophilins A and B (encoded by PPIA and PPIB), acute phase protein

112

S100A9, E-selectin (encoded by SELE) and platelet glycoprotein VI (encoded by GP6)

113

Additionally, CD147 has three Asn glycosylation sites, to which high mannose-type and complex-type

17-20

.

21

. Spike protein of SARS-CoV-2 is highly glycosylated

22

114

glycans might bind

, which increases the

115

chance of binding to the cells. It is possible that the virus can only attach to the cell surface and induce

116

different cellular programs, leading to cell overactivation, exhaustion and death, especially in the

117

severe phase of the disease, where cytokine storm and lymphopenia is commonly reported 23.

118

Cyclophilins A and B have been shown to interact with non-structural protein 1 (nsp1) of

119

SARS-CoV intracellularly 24,25. They can be incorporated to the viral capsid and released, which further

120

enables virus binding to CD147 and subsequent infection of CD147-expressing cells. Cyclophilins play

121

a critical role in the replication process of HIV-1, HCV and many other viruses 12,26. Cyclosporine A, a

122

strong immunosuppressive agent acts mainly via binding to cellular cyclophilins. In the same

123

mechanism, cyclosporine A suppresses replication of various coronaviruses

124

were identified as targets for pan-coronavirus inhibitors

125

cyclophilins can interact with SARS-CoV-2.

28

27

. Thus, cyclophilins

. Nevertheless, it is still not known if

126

Intracellular and transmembrane partners of CD147 are equally important in the infection

127

process of HIV, measles and SARS-CoV. It has been shown that truncation of cytoplasmic tail of CD147

128

prevents HIV infection 29. Therefore, it is possible that these molecules can take part and regulate

129

the process of SARS-CoV-2 entry through CD147 in a comparable way as TMPRSS2 and SLC6A19 for

130

ACE2. Main transmembrane partners of CD147 with direct binding sites to CD147 are

131

monocarboxylate transporters 1-4 (MCT1-MCT4; encoded by: SLC16A1, SLC16A7, SLC16A8,

132

SLC16A3), main glucose transporter, GLUT-1 (encoded by SLC2A1) and CD44 (encoded by CD44), an

133

important receptor for hyaluronan-main component of extracellular matrix 30-32. CD147 also interacts

134

intracellularly with integrins a3b1 and a6b1 (encoded by ITGA3, ITGA6, ITGB1) indirectly via CD98

135

(SLC7A5), CD43 (SPN), MCT4 and galectin-3 (LGALS3)

136

important protein complexes by direct interaction: NOD2 (NOD2), an important innate immunity

137

component and gamma-secretase complex, responsible for cleavage of beta-amyloid precursor from

138

plasma membranes, encoded by PSEN1, NCSTN, APH1A, APH1B, PSENEN 37,38. Due to the interactions

139

with so many molecules, CD147 plays a crucial role in energy metabolism of the cell, motility,

140

recruitment and activation, although the final outcome of its stimulation depends on the cell type

141

and co-expression of the other molecules. However, the co-expression of these molecules in different

142

cell types and across various human tissues is not known.

33-36

. In addition, CD147 suppresses two

143

Importantly, in T cells CD147 suppresses T-cell receptor-dependent activation mainly by

144

inhibition of nuclear factor of activated T-cells (NFATs) 39,40. The NFAT family consists of five proteins:

145

NF-ATc1 (encoded by NFATC1), NF-ATc2 (encoded by NFATC2), NF-ATc3 (encoded by NFATC3), NF5

41,42

146

ATc4 (encoded by NFATC4) and NF-AT5 (encoded by NFAT5)

. NFAT complex is a major

147

transcriptional regulator in naive T cells and differentiated effector T cells, dependent on

148

calcium/PLCg/calmodulin/calcineurin signaling 41,42. It is also crucial in regulation of T cell anergy and

149

in differentiation and function of T regulatory (Treg) cells 42. CD147 has been reported as a marker of

150

human Treg cells with highly suppressive activity 43. NFAT signaling is also important in other cell

151

types such as DCs, mast cells and B cells 41. Since cyclophilins are regulators of NFAT activation, the

152

extracellular binding of the virus through cyclophilin-CD147 complex, as well as intracellular

153

interactions of cyclophilins with the virus proteins might be important in COVID-19 development.

154

CD26 (encoded by DPP4), has emerged recently as a potential receptor for SARS-CoV-2, due

155

to the fact that it is a main cellular entry for MERS-CoV 44,45. Recent structural studies predict that

156

SARS-CoV-2 spike protein directly interact with CD26 on the host cells

157

glycoprotein involved in T-cell receptor-mediated T-cell activation and proliferation. It is highly

158

expressed in CD4 and CD8 T cells, and in lower quantities also in NK cells and DCs. As an additional

159

function, it acts as a serine exopeptidase, cleaving peptides of various chemokines, growth factors

160

and peptide hormones. Interestingly, it is also involved in extracellular matrix cleavage. It has been

161

shown in human cells that several polymorphisms in CD26 gene reduce entry of MERS into the host

162

cells 46. It remains to be functionally determined if this protein can be a functional receptor for SARS-

163

CoV-2.

22

. CD26 is a cell surface

164

The aim of our study was to analyze the gene expression of ACE2, CD147, cyclophilins, CD26

165

and other SARS-CoV-2-related molecules in the broad range of primary human innate and adaptive

166

immune cells and tissues, based on our own next generation sequencing data and public databases

167

from different human cell types and across the diseases which are known to predispose to COVID-

We analyzed gene expression of SARS-CoV-2 receptors and related molecules’ (Table S1) in a

175

broad range of tissues and immune cells from the human RNA-seq databases generated by our ex

176

vivo and in vitro approaches in the Swiss Institute of Asthma and Allergy Research (SIAF), by our

177

collaborators or from the Gene Expression Omnibus (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/). Baseline gene

178

expression was evaluated in vitro in air liquid interface (ALI) - differentiated human primary bronchial

179

epithelial cells (HBECs) (n=10). Direct ex vivo analyses of non-diseased human tissues included

180

bronchial biopsies (n=5), bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) cells (n=5) and skin biopsies (n=6). The other

181

ex vivo investigated samples included whole blood (n=5), neutrophils (n=4), classical monocytes

182

(n=4), plasmacytoid dendritic cells (pDCs) (n=4), innate lymphoid cells (ILC) 1, 2 and 3 (n=6 for each),

183

natural killer cells (NK) (n=4), naïve CD4+ T cells (n=4), terminal effector CD4+ T cells (n=2), naïve

184

CD8+ T cells (n=4), effector memory CD8+ T cells (n=4), naïve B cells (n=4) and plasmablasts (n=4) (for

185

sorting markers please see Table S2) .

186

We further investigated different expression patterns of ACE-2-, CD147- and CD26- related

187

genes in the context of potential COVID-19 risk factors, namely age, gender, smoking status, diagnosis

188

of asthma, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), hypertension, obesity, atopic dermatitis

196

PBMCs from infants and young children at age of 5-17 or 12-36 months (n=21 and 14, respectively),

197

older children and adolescents at age of 4-16 years (n=16) and adults at age of 16-67 years (n=19),

biopsies (control: n=6, atopic dermatitis: non lesional sites n=11, lesional sites n=11). All studies were

200

accompanied by the relevant ethical permissions, given by the appropriate Institutional Review

201

Board. Each control and diseased subject gave informed consent. Total RNA from evaluated cells and

202

tissues was extracted and transcriptome was analyzed with use of RNA-seq approaches.

Results

219
220

ACE2 and related molecules are exclusively expressed at the barrier sites, whereas CD147,

221

cyclophilins, CD26 and their interaction partners are ubiquitously expressed in immune cells and

222

in epithelium

223

First, we analyzed the baseline expression and co-expression of ACE2-, CD147- and CD26-

224

related genes in several immune cell types from control, non-diseased adult individuals. In

225

agreement with other recent reports, we observed the expression of ACE2 mainly in epithelial

226

tissues, such as human bronchial epithelial cells and bronchial and skin biopsies (Figure 1A and S1)

227

6,48

228

biopsies ACE2 was co-expressed with TMPRSS2 (Figure S2). Also, in the skin TMPRSS2 was very

229

prominent, while we did not find SLC6A19 in any of the analyzed cells and tissues (Figure 1B and S1).

230

None of the analyzed immune cells expressed ACE2 (Figure 1A), TMPRSS2 (Figure 1B) or

231

. ACE2 was more abundant in the lung, when compared with the skin barrier sides. In bronchial

SLC6A19 (Figures S1-3), either in the local lung environment (BAL cells) or in the blood.

232

In contrast to ACE2, we observed a prominent expression of CD147 (BSG) in epithelial and

233

innate and adaptive immune cells in the lung (BAL), in the skin and in circulation (whole blood,

234

neutrophils, classical monocytes, pDCs, ex vivo sorted ILC, NK, naïve CD4+ T cells, terminal effector

235

CD4+ T cells, naïve CD8+ T cells, effector memory CD8+ T cells, naïve B cells and plasmablasts) (Figure

236

1C, Figures S1-S3). Interestingly, ACE2 and CD147 (BSG) are not co-expressed in bronchial biopsy

237

(Figure S2). High expression of CD147 (BSG) in primary human bronchial epithelial cells suggests that

238

these cells having more than one receptor for SARS-CoV-2 entry could be infected in various

239

conditions. Granulocytes and macrophages are the main source of CD147 (BSG) expression 49, which

240

may explain high CD147 (BSG) expression in the whole blood and BAL observed in our data. Presence

241

of CD147 (BSG) on innate and adaptive memory immune cells may indicate the importance of this

242

receptor in systemic inflammatory response and development of immunological memory.

243

Since it is not clear yet how exactly the process of infection via CD147 (BSG) takes place in

244

case of SARS-CoV-2, we examined the presence and co-expression of extracellular partners of CD147

245

(BSG), which are implicated in the infection with other viruses using CD147 (BSG) for cell entry,

246

including SARS-CoV, HIV-1, measles and others

247

expression of cyclophilin A and B (PPIA and PPIB) (Figure 1D and E, Figure S1). Interestingly,

248

cyclophilin A was highly expressed in all ILC. In addition, cyclophilin B was highly expressed in pDCS,

249

ILC and plasmablasts. S100A9 was highly expressed not only in bronchial epithelium, but also in the

11-13

. All investigated cell populations showed high

250

whole blood, neutrophils, classical monocytes and, surprisingly, in naïve B cells (Figure 1F and Figure

251

S1).

252

Next, we examined transmembrane and intracellular partners of CD147 (BSG), because its

253

cytoplasmic tail, bound to many transmembrane partners, is essential in the entry of other viruses

254

29

255

are highly expressed not only at the barrier sites, but also in ILC (MCT2), pDCs, NK cells, T cells and B

256

cells (MCT2, GLUT1) (Figure 1G and H). CD44 is highly expressed in majority of cells, with the

257

exceptionally high expression in BAL, classical monocytes, naïve CD4+ T cells, terminal effector CD4+

258

T cells, naïve CD8+ T cells and effector memory CD8+ T cells (Figure 1I). ITGB1 (Integrin b-1) and other

259

integrins are highly expressed in airway epithelial cells, but also other cells expressed them (Figure

260

1J and Figure S1). NF-ATc1-3 (NFATC1, NFATC2, NFATC3) were expressed predominantly in CD4+ and

261

CD8+ T and naïve B cells, whereas expression of NFAT4 and NFAT5 was higher in the lung and skin

. We observed that monocarboxylate transporters, such as SLC16A7 (MCT2) and SLC2A1 (GLUT1)

263

Finally, we looked at the expression of CD26 (DPP4). Notably, it was expressed highly in all

264

ILC, and in naïve CD4+ and CD8+ T cells, as well as in pDCs and effector memory CD8+ T cells (Figure

265

1L and Figure S1).

Distinct expression profiles of ACE2-, CD147-, and CD26-related genes in PBMCs and T cells of

268

children, adolescents and adults

269

Clinical evidence from COVID-19 patients worldwide clearly demonstrate an association

270

between disease severity and morbidity with age 1 . In China, less than 1% of the SARS-CoV-2 positive

271

cases were in children younger than 10 years of age 50,51. Therefore, we analyzed expression patterns

272

of ACE2-, CD147-, and CD26-related genes in peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) from

273

infants, young children, adolescents and adults. While these comparisons can be limited due to the

274

different distribution of immune subsets in the blood of children and adults 52 and different ethnicity

275

of children (African American from South Africa and Tanzania) compared to adolescents and adults

276

(Caucasians), we observed that there are different patterns of expression for the majority of analyzed

277

genes (Figure 2A). We observed that CD147 (BSG) was highly expressed in PBMCs of children,

278

whereas its expression was lower in adolescents and in adults. Similarly, to CD147 (BSG), cyclophilins

279

B (PPIB), S100A9, SLC3A2 (CD98), SLC16A1 (MCT1), NFATC4 were less expressed in adults. On the

280

other hand, SLC16A3 (MCT4), SLC16A7 (MCT2), NFATC2, NFAT5, NFATC1, NFATC3, integrins (ITGB1)

281

were expressed on higher level in adults. Older children and adolescents showed intermediary gene

282

expression between children and adults.

283

Next, we compared ACE2-, CD147- and CD26-related gene expression profile in the purified

284

naïve CD4+ T cells between young children and adults (Figure 2B). Low expression of ACE2-related

285

genes was observed in both children and adults. Several CD147-related genes showed higher

286

expression in adults, including CD44, certain MCTs, SLC3A2 (CD98), SLC2A1 (GLUT1), NFATC1 and

287

NFATC3. Also, CD26 (DPP4) was expressed at a higher level in adults. In contrast, other CD147-related

288

genes were expressed at lower levels in adults, such as cyclophilins A and B (PPIA and PPIB), S100A9,

289

SLC7A5 (CD98), LGALS3, integrins (ITGA6, ITGA3) and NFATC2.

290
291

Asthma, COPD, hypertension, smoking, obesity and gender show different expression profiles of

292

ACE2-, CD147-, and CD26-related genes

293

We analyzed expression of ACE2-, CD147-and CD26-related genes from different cells and

294

tissues in various comorbidities and risk factors, which have been shown, or are suspected to

295

predispose to SARS-CoV-2 infection and/or COVID-19 progression. Upper and lower airways are the

296

initial entry of SARS-CoV-2, thus we first analyzed gene expression in the HBECs and the bronchial

297

biopsies from patients with asthma or COPD as compared to the non-diseased controls. In our

298

cohorts, we did not see any significant difference in ACE2 expression in HBECs or bronchial biopsy

299

between control, asthma and COPD patients (Figure 3A and B). However, in bronchial biopsies ACE2

300

expression was higher in smokers (Figure 3B). In HBECs, we observed higher expression of TMPRSS2

301

in asthma (Figure 3A), raising the possibility that in asthmatic airways the cleavage of spike protein

302

of SARS-CoV-2 might be more efficient. We also observed a trend of increased expression of CD147

303

(BSG) in HBECs (Figure 3A) and in bronchial biopsies (Figure 3B) from COPD patients. Additionally,

304

glucose transporter GLUT1 (SLC2A1), integrin a-3 (ITGA3) and galectin-3 (LGALS3) were higher

305

expressed in HBECs, whereas SLC7A5 (CD98), integrins a-3 (ITGA3) and a-6 (ITGA6) were higher

306

expressed in the bronchial biopsies of COPD patients. CD44 and APOD were higher expressed in

307

asthma (Figure 3A, B and Figures S4, S5). In bronchial biopsies, ACE2-, CD147- and CD26-related genes

308

showed similar cluster of co-expression in control and asthma (Figure S2 and S6). Interestingly, ACE2

309

co-expressed with PPIB and NME1 in asthma, which was not found in controls (Figure S6). Taken

310

together, airway epithelium in asthma and COPD showed a gene signature that potentially can

311

facilitate SARS-CoV-2 entry and enhance internalization after receptor binding.

312

Next, we analyzed BAL and whole blood gene expression in patients with asthma and controls

313

(Figure 3 C, D and Figure S7, S8). Unfortunately, we have access to the limited number of BAL samples

314

from COPD patients. In BAL, which reflects local lung immune microenvironment, and in blood,

315

reflecting systemic immune responses, CD147 (BSG) was expressed equally high in asthma patients

316

and in controls (Figure 3C, Figure S7). In blood, patients with asthma had also higher expression of

317

integrin ITGA6 and NFATC2, as compared to controls (Figure 3D). There was a greater abundance in

318

the cluster of co-expressed genes in asthma in BAL and especially in blood (Figure S9, S10). In asthma

319

patients, BSG (CD147) showed co-expression with SLC7A5 (CD98) in blood, DPP4 (CD26) also co-

320

expressed with CD44 and ITGA6 (Figure S10).

321

Next, we analyzed the ACE2-, CD147- and CD26- related gene expression in our controls,

322

asthma and COPD patients according to the additional clinical features, which have been reported as

323

a risk factor comorbidity for COVID-19, such as hypertension, smoking, gender and obesity 23,53. We

324

did not see any major differences in the gene expression in the bronchial biopsies based on these

325

features, except higher ACE2 expression in smokers (Figure 3B, Figure S5). However, we noted several

326

important differences in the BAL and in the whole blood (Figure 3 C, D and Figure S7, S8). Subjects

327

with hypertension had increased expression of cyclophilin A in both the BAL and blood, as well as

328

upregulated expression of MCT4 (SLC16A3), APH1A and PSENEN in the BAL and MCT2 (SLC16A7) in

329

the blood (Figure 3 C, D and Figure S7, S8). In case of smoking, expression of S100A9 and CD44 was

330

elevated in both BAL (Figure 3C, Figure S7) and blood (Figure 3D, Figure S8). Obesity was an important

331

factor leading to the significant changes in the BAL and blood. We observed that MCT4 (SLC16A3),

332

integrin ITGA3, NFATC1 and PSEN1 were more expressed in the BAL of obese individuals (Figure 3C,

333

Figure S7), whereas CD147 (BSG), PPIA, LGALS3 and NOD2 were more expressed in their blood (Figure

334

3D). Finally, regarding gender in our cohort, MCT2 (SLC16A7), CD98 (SLC7A5), NFATC2 were higher

335

expressed in the BAL of male subjects (Figure 3C, Figure S7).

336
337

Expression of CD147-related genes correlates with BMI and age in the BAL and blood

338

Since obesity and age were important variables, we additionally correlated these two

339

variables with the expression of ACE2-, CD147- and CD26-related genes in the bronchial biopsy, BAL

340

and blood of our adult non-diseased and diseased cohorts. We did not find any significant

341

correlations between BMI and age and the receptor-related gene expression in the bronchial

342

biopsies. However, we noted that the expression of SLC16A3 (MCT4), ITGA3, LGALS3 in BAL positively

343

correlated with BMI (Figure 4A-C) and the expression of CD44 positively correlated with the age of

344

the subjects (Figure 4D). Interestingly, whole blood expression of CD147 (BSG), PPIA, S100A9, CD44

345

and LGALS3 correlated positively with the BMI, whereas SLC16A3 positively correlated with age

346

(Figure 4 E-J). In summary, these findings suggest that higher BMI and older age lead to higher

347

expression of CD147-related genes on immune cells, but not on the barrier cells, which potentially

348

can influence the development and the course of COVID-19.

Eczema lesional skin in patients with atopic dermatitis present unique ACE2- and CD147-related

352

As we found a high expression of ACE2-, CD147- and CD26-related genes in the skin biopsies

353

of healthy subjects, and since COVID-19-related skin lesions have been recently reported 54, we also

354

analyzed the biopsies of healthy and atopic dermatitis (AD) skin. Interestingly, in the lesional skin as

355

compared to non-lesional skin of the same subjects, many CD147-related genes showed higher

356

expression, including cyclophilins (PPIA and PPIB), S100A9, CD44, MCTs, SLC7A5 (CD98) and integrins

(Figure 5).

Discussion

363

COVID-19 pandemic is developing at such a pace that extraordinary actions are being initiated to

364

learn quickly about its biology, transmission and potential means of prevention and treatment. In

365

this spirit, we first performed an extensive literature and database search and curated a list of proven

366

and potential receptors for SARS-CoV-2 and interaction partners, whose expression in different

367

tissues and cells might be involved in the course of immunological response in COVID-19 (Figure 6)

368

55

369

to evaluate the level of their expression and their co-expression profiles, as well as evaluated their

370

expression in healthy children, adolescents and adults. While interesting associations were observed

371

to be age-dependent, these findings must be further explored and repeated due to the possibility of

372

batch-specific systematic variations in the gene expression values between in-house and public

373

datasets. Despite our efforts in applying identical data analysis workflow for the datasets produced

374

by our group and those available in public repositories, different sequencing facilities and experiment

375

protocols can lead to altered gene expression values, especially for genes with extreme gene length

376

and G/C content. Finally, we analyzed gene expression in adults with known and potential COVID-19

377

comorbidities and risk factors such as COPD, asthma, hypertension, obesity, smoking, male gender

378

and AD. These conditions can be directly compared, as they were performed internally in the context

379

of same project.

. Next, we analyzed these genes in the broad spectrum of cell types and tissues in healthy controls

380

ACE2 is a receptor for SARS-CoV-2 3, whereas TMPRSS2 is a transmembrane host protease,

381

which cleaves the viral spike protein thus facilitating virus fusion to the cellular membranes process

382

(S) 3,56. SLC6A19, physiologically a neutral amino acid transporter, potentially can block the access of

383

TMPRSS2 to ACE2 and subsequently reduce active infection 4,6. Our results, in agreement with recent

384

reports

385

expression of protective SLC6A19 and thus might be highly susceptible for SARS-CoV-2 infection. In

386

addition, it has been shown recently that ACE2 is highly expressed in naso- and oropharynx, which

387

are the sites of active SARS-CoV-2 replication and a main source of infectious particles

388

Interestingly, we observed high expression of ACE2 and TMPRSS2 in bronchial airway epithelium: in

389

HBECs ALI cultures in vitro, as well as in vivo in humans in bronchial biopsies, indicating that they can

390

be as important in initiation and progression of COVID-19, as recently shown for type II pneumocytes

391

58

392

known to be expressed is intestine 59. Interestingly, in contrast to Leung and colleagues 60, we have

393

not seen higher expression of ACE2 in HBECs or bronchial biopsy of patients with COPD, but our

6,57,58

, indicate that airway epithelium has high ACE2 and TMPRSS2 co-expression, and no

6,57,58

.

. We have not observed the expression of SLC6A19 in any of the analyzed cells and tissues, yet it is

394

sample size was very limited, and potentially a bronchial biopsy site was different, which might be

395

the reason of this inconsistency. However, consistently with this report

396

expression of ACE2 in the bronchial biopsy of current smokers, which might indicate that current

397

smoking status, might be a stronger factor of increased ACE2 expression in airway epithelium than

398

COPD per se. On the other hand, ACE2 and the angiotensin II type 2 receptor (AT2) were reported to

399

protect from severe acute lung injury in mice

400

infection and COVID-19 progression should be further explored. In addition, in HBECs of patients with

401

asthma, we observed higher expression of TMPRSS2, which increases the possibility of SARS-CoV-2

402

cleavage in asthmatic bronchi. Even though initially asthma was not reported to be a significant

403

comorbidity for COVID-19, more observations from Europe and the US seem to show otherwise 63. It

404

might be related to the heterogeneity of asthma endotypes type 2 asthma (allergic) and non- type 2

405

(non-allergic). Allergen exposure, allergic sensitization and high IgE lead to lower ACE2 expression in

406

the nasal and bronchial epithelium of asthma patients 64. Thus, it is possible that ACE2 expression in

407

the airways of allergic patients, even if slightly protective in terms of infection with SARS-CoV-2,

408

might also predispose to faster progression of COVID-19 to more severe forms, especially in case of

409

higher TMPRSS2 expression.

61

, we observed higher

, therefore an importance of ACE2 in SARS-CoV-2

410

We found that immune cells do not express ACE2, TMPRSS2 or SLC6A19, which has also been

411

observed by others 2,5. Importantly though, we found that CD147 and its extracellular agonists and

412

transmembrane partners are highly expressed in innate and adaptive immune cells in the lungs and

413

in the periphery, suggesting that they should be further investigated in SARS-CoV-2 spread and

414

COVID-19 pathology 9. Here, we report high expression of CD147 in both, epithelial tissues and innate

415

and adaptive immune cells. Potentially, epithelial cells, macrophages, monocytes, ILCs, NK cells, T

416

cells and B cells can be infected in the lungs or can carry SARS-CoV-2 from infected epithelial cells via

417

CD147 and participate in the local and systemic spread of the virus, and in exaggerated immune

418

response 65.

419

We found here that CD147 is slightly higher expressed in the HBECs and bronchial biopsy of

420

COPD patients, as well as it is higher expressed in the blood of obese individuals. Obesity is one of

421

the main comorbidities reported in patients with severe COVID-19 63, and since CD147 expression in

422

the whole blood correlates positively with BMI in our cohort, it certainly needs further attention in

423

relation to COVID-19. Importantly, CD147 expression is upregulated by high glucose concentrations

PPIB) is increased in subjects with hypertension and obesity and PPIA correlated positively with BMI

430

in the whole blood, which is confirmed in other studies 67. In addition, nsp1 protein of SARS-CoV binds

431

to CD147 via cyclophilins and reduces interferon responses 25 in infected cells. It also inhibits NF-ATs

432

translocation activation in T cells, leading to suppression of immune responses

433

mechanisms might be more potent in obese patients, especially with hypertension, due to higher

434

expression of both cyclophilins on the periphery. Also, the other extracellular ligand of CD147-

435

S100A9 correlated positively with BMI. CD147 transmembrane partners such as LGALS3, MCT4

436

(SLC16A3), MCT2 (SLC16A7), ITGA3 and NFATC1 were elevated in the blood or BAL of obese or

437

hypertensive individuals, as well as the expression of LGALS3, S100A9 and CD44 correlated positively

438

with BMI. Importantly in individuals who are current smokers S100A9 and CD44 are elevated in the

439

BAL and in the blood. MCTs regulate the transport of lactate, pyruvate and ketone bodies across the

440

cell membrane

441

contact at the epithelial barriers 70. CD44 in acute inflammation triggered by hyaluronic acid lead to

442

the cell activation and release of many proinflammatory cytokines whereas in the longer terms

443

induce lung fibrosis

444

CoV have spike protein- specific memory cytotoxic T cells, which express CD44 73. Thus, our results

445

suggest a possible role of CD147 and its extracellular and intracellular ligands in COVID-19

446

pathogenesis via regulation of cell metabolism, motility and activation, especially in patients with

447

comorbidities. A clinical trial with anti-CD147 in COVID-19 patients seems to confirm its pleiotropic

448

role in SARS-CoV-2 infection, but it requires further research to investigate the involved mechanisms

that many COVID-19 cases developed nonpruritic, erythematous rashes, urticaria or varicella-like

453

lesions 54,74, but so far it is not known if they are a place of viral replication or just a local reaction to

454

systemic infection. Similarly, not much is yet known about the potential connections between AD

455

and the course of COVID-19 75. Yet, severe and untreated AD is a known risk factor for disseminated

456

viral skin disease 76. Therefore, our observations indicating higher expression of cyclophilins, CD44,

457

S100A9, integrins, MCTs and other CD147-related genes require further studies about their role in

458

the course of SARS-CoV-2 infection in healthy subjects and in AD patients.

459

CD26 (DPP4) is another receptor important in coronavirus infection, described in MERS-CoV,

460

potentially recognizing SARS-CoV-2 21,77. Similar to CD147, CD26 was expressed in all investigated cell

461

types, except B cells. ILCs showed highest expression of DPP4 from all analyzed cells, which is in

462

agreement with recent findings 78. However, not much is known about the variable expression of

463

CD26 among ILC1, ILC2 and ILC3. Potentially, a high level of CD26 on the surface of ILCs in the lung

464

may be another mechanism of systemic spread of the virus.

465

The differential profile of ACE2-, CD147- and CD26-related gene expression in healthy subjects

466

of different ages need to be interpreted with caution due to the distinct origins of these populations,

467

as well as potential experimental bias (even if we performed normalization strategies, similar

468

bioinformatic pipelines and cautious assessment of raw data quality, prior to analysis). Nevertheless,

469

our observations are largely in agreement with other recent findings correlating gene expression in

470

the whole blood and PBMCs with age 79. Having this in mind, it is intriguing to observe that expression

471

of NOD2, some MCTs, integrins and NFATs seemed to increase with age, whereas the expression of

472

genes coding g-secretase complex is decreasing with age in PBMCs. CD44 and MCT4 also correlated

473

with age in BAL and blood, respectively. Moreover, some of the differences between children and

474

adults, such as higher expression of CD26, CD44, GLUT1 (SLC2A1) and specific NFATs in adults were

475

also observed in naïve purified CD4+ T cells. This requires further investigation, but differences in

476

expression pattern may be related to the striking differences in the morbidity of SARS-CoV-2

477

between children and adults 80.
