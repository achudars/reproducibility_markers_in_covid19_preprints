Abstract
13

Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) ORF7a, the ortholog of

14

SARS-CoV ORF7a, is a type I transmembrane protein and plays an important role in virus-host

15

interactions. Deletion variants in ORF7a may influence virulence, but only a few such isolates

16

have been reported. Here, we report 8 unique ORF7a deletion variants of 6 to 96 nucleotides in

17

length identified from 2,726 clinical specimens collected in March of 2020.

Main Text
19

Although Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) genomes are

20

considered genetically stable, various mutations within the genome have been reported [1].

21

SARS-CoV-2 ORF7a, the ortholog of SARS-CoV ORF7a, is a type I transmembrane protein and

22

plays an important role in virus-host interactions [2, 3]. Deletion variants in ORF7a may

23

influence virulence, but only a few such isolates have been reported [4-6].

24

As part of an ongoing SPHERES Consortium project [7], we sequenced the SARS-CoV-

25

2 genome from deidentified patient specimens submitted for testing at Quest Diagnostics in

26

March 2020. Remnant extracted RNA of RT-PCR confirmed positive specimens was converted

27

to cDNA and amplified with primers published by the ARTIC network [8]. Sequencing libraries

28

were generated from the amplicons using the TWIST library preparation kit and sequenced on an

29

illumina MiSeq (2x250 cycles). We utilized an in-house bioinformatics pipeline to generate

30

consensus genomes and identified variants relative to the reference genome MN908947.3,

31

Wuhan-Hu-1. Consensus genomes and sequencing reads are deposited under NCBI BioProject id

32

PRJNA631061.

33

We identified 8 unique ORF7a deletion variants (Table 1) in 0.3% (8/2,726) clinical

34

specimens. Specimens MW309829, MW309830, MW190280, and MW190429 had deletions in

35

the ectodomain (96, 57, 18, and 12 nucleotides, respectively) associated with a loss of β-sheet

36

strand(s) (Figure 1A) [9, 10]. In contrast to the previously reported ORF7a deletions [4-6], the

37

deletions in these 4 isolates retained the signal peptide, transmembrane and cytoplasmic

38

domains. The 96-nt and 57-nt deletion isolates also harbored ORF7a substitutions T120I or

39

L102R. Specimens MW064508 and MW064714 harbored deletions in the transmembrane

40

domain (9 and 6 nucleotides, respectively). Specimens MW309831 and MW314605 contained

41

out-of-frame deletions of 40 and 13 nucleotides. The 40-nucleotide deletion resulted in the

42

replacement of 18 amino acids spanning the transmembrane (partial) and cytoplasmic domains

43

with 6 amino acids (KERQND, Figure 1A). The 13-nucleotide deletion removed the ORF7a stop

44

codon and the ORF7b start codon, resulting in an extended ORF7a and a truncated ORF7b.

59

All deletion variants were confirmed by Sanger sequencing using amplicons targeting the

60

ORF7a-ORF7b regions (Figure 1B). Three of the 8 isolates were heterogenous, with deletion

61

variant frequency between 18% and 38% as determined by next-generation sequencing (NGS)

62

(Table 1). Phylogenetic lineage analysis showed that the 57-nt deletion isolate belonged to

63

pangolin lineage A.3, and the remaining 7 isolates were lineage B.1 (n=4), B.1.2 (n=2), or B.1.36

64

(n=1) [11]. The RT-PCR test cycle thresholds of the 8 deletion isolates were between 12 and 27,

65

indicating efficient viral replication.

66

A recent study found that SARS-CoV-2 ORF7a is an immunomodulating factor for

67

human CD14+ monocytes triggering an aberrant inflammatory response; the 4-stranded (βA, βC,

68

βF, and βG) β-sheet in the ectodomain was suggested to be the major functional interface [10].

69

As the 4 ectodomain deletion variants in our study resulted in the loss of at least 1 β-sheet strand

70

within the functional interface, we hypothesize that those isolates would have lost ORF7a

71

biochemical function. Further studies are needed to understand the effects of these deletions on

72

viral fitness or the clinical course of COVID-19.
