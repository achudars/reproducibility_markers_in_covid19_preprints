Abstract

22

COVID-19 (coronavirus disease 2019) is a pandemic caused by SARS-CoV-2 (severe acute

23

respiratory syndrome-coronavirus 2) infection affecting millions of persons around the world. There is an

24

urgent unmet need to provide an easy-to-produce, affordable medicine to prevent transmission and

25

provide early treatment for this disease. The nasal cavity and the rhinopharynx are the sites of initial

26

replication of SARS-CoV-2. Therefore, a nasal spray may be a suitable dosage form for this purpose. The

27

main objective of our study was to test the antiviral action of three candidate nasal spray formulations

28

against SARS-CoV-2. We have found that iota-carrageenan in concentrations as low as 6 µg/ mL inhibits

29

SARS-CoV-2 infection in Vero cell cultures. The concentrations found to be active in vitro against

30

SARS-CoV-2 may be easily achieved by the application of nasal sprays already marketed in several

31

countries. Xylitol at a concentration of 5 % m/V has proved to be viricidal on its own and the association

32

with iota-carrageenan may be beneficial, as well.

Introduction

35

SARS-CoV-2 is a single stranded positive sense RNA virus responsible for COVID-19. COVID-

36

19 has become one of the worst pandemics of our time counting more than 12.232,700 confirmed cases

37

and more than 554,000 deaths worldwide by July 10th, 2020 [1]. In most cases, COVID-19 manifests

38

itself clinically with flu-like symptoms as a mild or uncomplicated illness, eventually resolving

39

spontaneously. However, 15% of patients develop severe pneumonia that requires hospitalization and

40

oxygen support, and 5% of them need admission to an intensive care unit (ICU). More than half of this

41

patients may die [2]. Even children can be affected although with milder symptoms than adults and can be

42

transmitters of the disease. [3]. There are no adequate therapeutic or preventive medicines available, so

43

effective therapeutic approaches are urgently needed to reduce the spread of the virus and its death toll.

During the first days of disease the virus is localized mainly in the nasal cavity and the

45

nasopharynx [4,5]. Recent data show that high viral load and a long virus-shedding period was associated

46

with severe COVID-19 [6, 7]. Therefore, the use of antiviral nasal sprays would contribute to reduce

47

nasal and nasopharyngeal viral load, thus slowing down the disease progression in the treated patient and

48

the disease transmission to others in close contact with him or her.

49

Carrageenans are linear sulfated polysaccharides that are often extracted from red seaweeds.

50

Carrageenans are commercially available in the form of kappa (κ), iota (ι) or lambda (λ). They have been

51

used for years as thickening agents and stabilizers for food. At present they are extensively used in the

52

food (cold cuts, cheese, etc.) and in the cosmetic and pharmaceutical industry as suspension and emulsion

53

stabilizers. Their antiviral capacity has been described decades ago and has been experimentally

54

confirmed on herpes virus type 1 and 2, human papiloma virus, H1N1 influenza virus, dengue virus,

55

rhinovirus, hepatitis A virus, enteroviruses, and coronaviruses. Iota-carrageenan inhibits several viruses

56

based on its interaction with the surface of viral particles, thus preventing them from entering cells and

57

trapping the viral particles released from the infected cells. [8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13].

58

Iota-carrageenan formulated into a nasal spray has proved to be safe and effective against virus

59

causing common cold [14,15,16]. In vitro studies in cell cultures (HeLa and Calu-3) and in primary

60

respiratory epithelial cells have shown inhibition of rhinovirus, Influenza virus and common-cold

61

coronavirus. Iota-carrageenan is most active against common-cold coronavirus, inhibiting the infection up

62

to 90 %. An iota-carrageenan spray reduced mortality by at least 50 % in mice infected with lethal doses

63

of H1N1 influenza virus [17]. In all cases the antiviral action of iota-carrageenan is more effective, when

64

administrated preventively or in the early stages of disease and has shown synergy with other antiviral

65

agents. Studies performed on adults and children with common cold demonstrate effectivity of iota-

66

carrageenan nasal spray to alleviate the clinical symptoms and shorten their duration, as well as to

67

decrease the viral load of nasopharyngeal specimens and the relapses during the follow-up period [14, 15,

68

16, 18, 19, 20]. Iota-carrageenan-containing nasal sprays are already on the market in several countries in

69

the world.

Xylitol is a polyol that has been used as a sugar substitute in Finland since the 1960s. It is a

71

polyol, (formula CHOH)3(CH2OH)2), which is obtained from xylan extracted from hardwood, which has

72

demonstrated multiple health benefits [21]. It has been extensively used in buccal health care to prevent

73

caries because of its antibacterial capacity. It is already being used in otorhinolaryngology as a nasal

74

spray and lavage for the treatment of rhinosinusitis and the prevention of otitis media. [22,23]. Studies “in

75

vitro” and in animal models has shown antiviral properties of Xylitol against human respiratory syncytial

76

virus (24).

77

Both iota-carrageenan and xylitol are safe for humans, being used in much larger amounts as food

78

additive and sweetener, respectively, than those that may be used for nasal delivery. Nasal safety of iota-

79

carrageenan by nasal and nebulization administration has been already confirmed empirically [25]. The

80

same holds for 5 % Xylitol water solution both applied as nasal spray and nasal irrigation [26], as well as

81

applied as a nebulization solution [27]. Both are included in nasal formulations already on the market for

82

use in children and adults.

83

Based on the above knowledge, an experiment was designed and carried out in a Biosafety Level

84

3 (BSL3) laboratory to investigate the SARS-CoV-2 inhibition capacity of three different candidate

85

preservative-free nasal formulations.

seed stock was prepared in T175 flasks of Vero E6 cells using a multiplicity of infection (MOI) of 0.1.

96

Each flask was harvested on day two post-infection and supernatant was centrifuged twice at 220 x g for

97

15 minutes to remove cellular debris. Titer of virus stock was determined by plaque assay on Vero E6

Preparation of sample formulations

101

All the formulations and placebos were prepared at Laboratorio Pablo Cassará S.R.L. (Argentina)

102

under aseptic conditions and provided by Amcyte (US) to the University of Tennessee Health Science

103

Center. Composition of different formulations is depicted in Tables 1 and 2. Samples 1, 2 and 3 were

104

diluted at stock concentrations of 1200 µg/mL, 120 µg/mL, 12 µg/mL and 1.2 µg/mL using samples P1,

105

P2 and P3 respectively as diluents. To determine antiviral efficacy of formulations by titer reduction

106

assay, sample formulations were used at a final iota-carrageenan concentration of 600 µg/mL; 60 µg/mL,

107

6 µg/mL and 0.6 µg/mL. Equivalent concentration of placebos (samples P1, P2 and P3) was used for titer

Titer reduction assay

120

Vero E6 cells were seeded in 12-well plates at density of 2.5x105/well and grown overnight at

121

370C under 5%CO2. Next day, cells were washed with PBS (pH 7.2), followed by addition of equivalent

122

amount of c-MEM with reduced FBS (2%) and sample/placebo formulations. Formulations were

123

incubated with cells for 2 hr, after which the supernatant was removed. Cells were infected with 2.5x104

124

pfu (MOI=0.1) of virus for 1 hr at 37C, 5%CO2 with rocking at 15 min intervals. After incubation wells

125

were washed with DPBS, and sample/placebo formulations were added at same concentrations. After

126

incubation for 2 days, well contents were collected. For titer reduction, wells with no treatment (only

127

virus) and cells only were included. Virus titer was determined by performing a TCID50 assay using MTT

128

to measure cell viability. Virus endpoint titer was determined using the Reed-Muench formula and

129

expressed as log TCID50/mL. Residual virus titer from sample/placebo formulation treated wells was

130

plotted against virus titer from untreated wells.

Results

134

To examine the antiviral effects of iota-carrageenan on SARS-CoV-2, three sample formulations

135

were developed and tested. Each of the three sample formulations were tested in a dose dependent manner

136

based on the concentration of iota-carrageenan and ranged from 600 µg/mL to 0 µg/mL. SARS-CoV-2

137

samples treated with 600 µg/mL and 60 µg/mL of sample formulation 1 were reduced > 3.75 Log when

138

compared to untreated control (Figure 1). The 6 µg/mL concentration of sample formulation 1 also

139

demonstrated an effect but to a lesser extent, with a 2.5 Log reduction in virus (Figure 1). No activity was

140

observed with 0.6 µg/mL of Iota-carrageenan (Figure 1). Lastly, there was no reduction in virus with P1,

141

suggesting that Iota-carrageenan and not the components of sample formulation 1 is inhibiting SARS-

142

CoV-2 (Figure 1)

143
144

SARS-CoV-2 samples treated with dilutions of sample 2 at final iota-carrageenan concentrations

145

of 600 µg/mL, 60 µg/mL, and 6 µg/mL were reduced > 4.25 Log compared to untreated control (Figure

146

2). The 0.6 µg/mL concentration of iota-carrageenan was also not effective with sample 2 (Figure 2). No

147

reduction in virus with P2 was observed, suggesting that iota-carrageenan and not the components of

148

formulation 2 is inhibiting SARS-CoV-2 (Figure 2).

149
150

SARS-CoV-2 samples treated with dilutions of sample 2 at final iota-carrageenan concentrations

151

of 600 µg/mL, 60 µg/mL, and 6 µg/mL were reduced > 4.25 Log compared to untreated control (Figure

152

2). The 0.6 µg/mL concentration of iota-carrageenan was also not effective with sample 2 (Figure 2). No

153

reduction in virus with P2 was observed, suggesting that iota-carrageenan and not the components of

154

formulation 2 is inhibiting SARS-CoV-2 (Figure 2).

All concentrations tested (600 - 0.6 µg/mL) with sample 3 demonstrated antiviral activity

including the P3 control that did not contain iota-carrageenan (Figure 3). Xylitol was present in this

183

sample formulation and not in sample 1 or 2. The result suggests this component might also exert an

184

antiviral effect.

Discussion

210

Results from our study indicate that iota-carrageenan significantly inhibits SARS-CoV-2 in vitro.

211

Our results are encouraging for clinical use of iota-carrageenan nasal spray for the prevention and early

212

treatment of COVID-19. Clinical studies have demonstrated that iota-carrageenan nasal spray

213

formulations already effective in vitro against rhinovirus [11] proved to be clinically effective in

214

preventing and reducing symptoms and duration of common cold [14, 15, 16, 18]. Moreover, this study

215

was designed so that the concentrations tested in vitro resemble the immediate concentration in nasal

216

cavity and lower concentrations expected as iota-carrageenan is cleared from it. To do that we estimated

217

airway surface liquid volume to be in the range 50 – 375 µL in nasal cavity based on a surface area of the

218

nasal mucosa of 100 – 250 cm2 [28, 29, 30, 31] and airway surface liquid height estimated as 5 – 15 µm

[32. 33]. If we take an average content of 200 µL of airway surface liquid in the nose plus 200 µL of

220

formulation after delivering one 100-µL of a 1.2 mg/mL iota-carrageenan solution in each nostril, the

221

immediate concentration of iota-carrageenan in the nasal cavity would be 600 µg/mL, coinciding with

222

the highest concentration tested in vitro and capable of reducing virus yield to the LOD in our assay.

223

Furthermore, considering that even 1/100 of this concentration is still active in vitro and that iota-

224

carrageenan may stay for 4 hours [19] in the nasal cavity, there is a reasonable chance that this nasal spray

225

may significantly help in the prevention and early treatment of COVID-19. Expected concentrations of

226

iota-carrageenan in the nasal cavity will be even higher, if we consider a nasal formulation containing 1.7

227

mg / mL (0.17 % m/V) as some marketed nasal sprays.

228
229

The other remarkably interesting result is that xylitol exhibits antiviral activity on SARS-CoV-2

230

based on the results obtained with sample P3. Xylitol has been demonstrated to reduce titers of Human

231

Respiratory Syncytial Virus in Hep-2 cells culture and in infected mice [24].

232

Despite the implementation of severe personal protection measures, pandemic continues to affect

233

a significant proportion of health care workers with severe consequences for them, their patients, and the

234

community. At the same time, most COVID-19 patients remain at home, thus increasing the likely

235

exposure of household members and caregivers. Providing them with simple interventions as nasal sprays

236

with either iota-carrageenan or xylitol in the same or different nasal devices may lower the risk of

237

infection progression and transmission.

238

An inhalation solution of the same composition may be effective in case of severe cases of

239

COVID 19. Even though there are studies showing safety of the use of both carrageenan and xylitol in

240

nebulization [25,27], clinical trials would be needed to fully confirm these hypotheses. Risk of spreading

241

the virus should be considered in this form of administration and due protection should be used to contain

242

it [34].

We are starting multicenter randomized controlled trials to evaluate the efficacy of iota-

244

carrageenan nasal sprays in health care staff assisting COVID-19 patients and in patients suffering from

245

COVID 19 and other persons in close contact with them. However, it must be stressed that this and other

246

similar nasal sprays are on the market and their safety profile is remarkable. The current COVID-19

247

emergency warrants the urgent development of potential strategies to protect people even if more robust

248

data on antiviral therapies is yet to come.

249
250

Conclusions

251

Iota-carrageenan inhibits SARS CoV-2 in vitro at concentrations easily achievable by nasal and

252

nebulization formulations. Furthermore, xylitol exhibits antiviral activity on SARS-CoV-2, as well. An

253

association with iota-carrageenan may be beneficial. There are already nasal sprays on the market having

254

similar formulations to some of those tested in this in vitro study with adequate safety profile. Clinical

255

trials are in progress to evaluate that nasal sprays based on the tested formulations are useful in the

256

prevention and treatment of COVID 19. The data presented here are certainly encouraging in this

257

direction.
