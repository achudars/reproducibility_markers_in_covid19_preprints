Abstract
Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), which originated in

Wuhan, China, in 2019, is responsible for the COVID-19 pandemic. It is now accepted

that the wild fauna, probably bats, constitute the initial reservoir of the virus, but little

communities, knowing the ability of SARS-CoV-2 to infect some domestic animals. We

tested 21 domestic pets (9 cats and 12 dogs) living in close contact with their owners

(belonging to a veterinary community of 20 students) in which two students tested

positive for COVID-19 and several others (n = 11/18) consecutively showed clinical

signs (fever, cough, anosmia, etc.) compatible with COVID-19 infection. Although a few

pets presented many clinical signs indicative for a coronavirus infection, no animal

tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 by RT-PCR and no antibodies against SARS-CoV-2 were

detectable in their blood using an immunoprecipitation assay. These original data can

serve a better evaluation of the host range of SARS-CoV-2 in natural environment

exposure conditions.

SARS-CoV-2 infection has presented unprecedented challenges related to viral disease

control and prevention worldwide. While the emergence of the virus is now well-

documented, important questions regarding the transmissibility of the disease among

human populations remain to be answered. In particular, the hypothesis that small

domestic animals could serve as intermediate or amplification hosts of the virus needs

to be further addressed, in order to improve epidemiological models and to undertake

appropriate preventive measures.

We investigated the presence of SARS-CoV-2 infection of domestic cats (n = 9) and

dogs (n = 12) living in close contact with French veterinary students who were their
