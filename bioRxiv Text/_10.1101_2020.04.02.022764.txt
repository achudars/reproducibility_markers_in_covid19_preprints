Abstract:

33

The ongoing historic outbreak of COVID-19 not only constitutes a global public health crisis, but also carries a

34

devastating social and economic impact. The disease is caused by a newly identified coronavirus, Severe

35

Acute Respiratory Syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). There is an urgent need to identify antivirals to

36

curtail the COVID-19 pandemic. Herein, we report the remarkable sensitivity of SARS-CoV-2 to recombinant

37

human interferons α and β (IFNα/β). Treatment with IFN-α at a concentration of 50 international units (IU) per

38

milliliter drastically reduces viral titers by 3.4 log or over 4 log, respectively, in Vero cells. The EC 50 of IFN-α

39

and IFN-β treatment is 1.35 IU/ml and 0.76 IU/ml, respectively, in Vero cells. These results suggest that SARS-

40

CoV-2 is more sensitive than many other human pathogenic viruses, including SARS-CoV. Overall, our results

41

demonstrate the potent efficacy of human Type I IFN in suppressing SARS-CoV-2 infection, a finding which

42

could inform future treatment options for COVID-19.

Introduction

45

The COVID-19 outbreak started in Wuhan, China in December 2019 and rapidly spread globally, causing over

46

752,000 confirmed cases and 36,000 deaths as of April 1, 2020. The causative agent for the COVID-19

47

disease is a newly identified Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) (1), which is

48

transmitted through aerosol/droplet inhalation or contact. This historic outbreak has caused a public health

49

crisis much more severe than the SARS outbreak, which “only” caused 8,098 infections and 774 deaths

50

between November 2002 and July 2003. The COVID-19 outbreak also has had a devastating social and

51

economic impact worldwide. In March, the World Health Organization has declared COVID-19 a pandemic. In

52

the USA, there are over 200,000 confirmed cases and 4,300 deaths as of April 1, 2020. It is warned by the

53

CDC that the COVID-19 pandemic may claim over 100,000 lives in USA ( https://www.msn.com/en-

54

nz/news/world/us-could-face-200000-coronavirus-deaths-millions-of-cases-fauci-warns/ar-BB11UlOj).

55

Therefore, there is an urgent need to find treatments for COVID-19. Drugs already approved for the treatment

56

of other diseases may offer the most expedient option for treating COVID-19, and several such drugs are

57

already being tested in clinical trials.

58
59

Type I interferons (IFN-α/β) have broad spectrum antiviral activities against RNA viruses, which act by inducing

60

an antiviral response across a wide range of cell types and mediating adaptive immune response. Humans

61

produce 13 types of IFN-α and a singular IFN-β (2). Type I IFNs ultimately induces a number of interferon-

62

stimulated genes (ISGs) which encode for a variety of antiviral effectors (3). Notably, IFN- production leads to

63

a positive feedback loop that further stimulates the expression of many of the IFN-α genes (4). Clinically, Type

64

I IFNs have already been approved for use in the treatment of certain cancers, autoimmune disorders, and

65

viral infections (hepatitis B and hepatitis C). We assessed the sensitivity of SARS-CoV-2 to both IFN-α and

66

IFN- in vitro. Herein, we report that type I IFNs exhibited potent anti-SARS-CoV-2 activities in cultured cells,

67

demonstrating the therapeutic potency of type I IFNs for COVID-19.

MATERIALS AND METHODS

70

Virus and Cells.

71

The SARS-CoV-2 (USA-WA1/2020) was obtained from The World Reference Center for Emerging Viruses and

72

Arboviruses (WRCEVA), University of Texas Medical Branch, Galveston, TX. Stock virus was propagated by

73

infecting Vero cells (ATCC CCL-81) at a low multiplicity of infection (MOI) of 0.0025. Three days after infection,

74

supernatants were harvested and centrifuged at 2000 rpm for 5 min to remove cell debris. Stock virus was

75

titrated with a 50% tissue culture infectious dose assay (TCID 50) (5). All experiments involving infectious virus

76

were conducted at the University of Texas Medical Branch (Galveston, TX) in approved biosafety level 3

77

laboratories in accordance with institutional health and safety guidelines and federal regulations.

78

Virus growth curve:

79

Vero cells were infected by SARS-CoV-2 at MOI 1 or 0.01 for 1 hr. Then inoculum was removed, replaced with

80

media (DMEM+5%FBS) and incubated at 37 oC and 5% CO2. At different time points after infection,

81

supernatants were harvested. Virus titers were determined by a TCID50 assay on Vero cells.

82

Virus sensitivity to IFN treatment (infectious virus reduction assay):

83

Vero cells (2x104/well) were seeded into 48-well plates for 24 h and treated with human IFN-β1a (mammalian,

84

cat# 11415, PBL) and IFN-α (Universal Type I alpha A/D (Bg III), PBL, cat# 11200-1) at different

85

concentrations for 16 h. Cells were then infected with SARS-CoV-2 at an MOI of 0.01 TCID 50/cell. IFNs were

86

supplemented after virus infection. Supernatants were collected at 22 hr post infection and assayed for virus

87

titers.

88

Virus sensitivity to IFN treatment (CPE inhibition assay)

89

Vero cells grown on 96-well plates (2x104/well) were treated with 2-fold serial diluted human IFN-β1a or IFN-α

90

for 16 h (250 IU/ml to 0.49 IU/ml). Cells were then infected with SARS-CoV-2 at an MOI of 0.01 TCID 50/cell or

91

Vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV, Indiana strain) at MOI 0.1 PFU/cell for 1 hr. The inoculums were removed and

92

replaced with fresh media. As controls, cells were mock-infected, or infected without IFN treatment. All

93

experiments were performed in quadruplicates. For VSV samples, the supernatants were aspirated at 12 hpi.

94

The monolayers were washed with PBS for three times to remove dead cells, fixed with 10% formaldehyde,

95

and stained with crystal violet for cytopathic effect (CPE) observation. For SARS-CoV-2 samples, CPE was

96

observed at 72 hpi.

98

Results

99

The growth kinetics of the newly identified SARS-CoV-2 in cultured cells had not been characterized. Thus, we

100

first examined the growth kinetics of SARS-CoV-2 in Vero cells. Vero cells were infected at either a low MOI

101

(MOI=0.01) or high MOI (MOI=1). Supernatant was collected every 8-16 hours. At both conditions, viral titers

102

peaked at approximately 24 hours post-infection (hpi) and remained stable until 40 hours post-infection before

103

declining (Fig. 1). The peak virus titer was 5.5x106 TCID50/ml at MOI 0.01 and 3.75x105 TCID50/ml at MOI 1,

104

indicating that viral replication was more efficient at a low MOI (MOI=0.01) than a high MOI (MOI=1).

105

Additionally, virus infection caused strong cytopathic effect (CPE), which was evident at 48 hpi, much later than

106

the peak of virus production (at 40 hpi).

107

108

Next, we examined the effect of recombinant human IFN-α and IFN-β treatment on viral infection. Vero cells

109

were pre-treated with different concentrations of IFN-α or IFN-β ranging from 50-1000 international units (IU)

110

per milliliter for 16 hours. After 1 hour of infection with SARS-CoV-2 (MOI 0.01), media containing IFN was

111

returned, and cells were incubated for a further 22 hours. Supernatants were then collected, and viral titers

112

were determined via TCID50 assay. The result indicated that IFN- treatment potently inhibited SARS-CoV-2

113

infection. Virus titers were not detectable except at the lowest concentration tested (50 IU/ml), at which the viral

114

titers were drastically reduced by 4 logs of magnitude (Fig. 2). For IFN-β, the virus titers were below the

115

detection limit at all concentrations tested (50 u/ml-1000u/ml), indicating more potent anti-SARS-CoV-2 activity

116

than IFN-α. Consistently, no CPE was observable under microscopic examination in all IFN-treated samples.

117

118

We next tested the antiviral efficacy of IFN-α and IFN-β at lower concentrations (1-50 IU/ml). Both IFN-α and

119

IFN-β dose-dependently inhibited virus infection at these lower concentrations (Fig. 3). IFN-α exhibited anti-

120

SARS-CoV-2 activity at a concentration as low as 5 IU/ml, resulting in a significant reduction of viral titer by

121

over 1 log (P<0.01). With increasing IFN-α concentrations, the virus titers steadily decreased. Treatment with

122

IFN-α at 50 IU/ml drastically reduces viral titers by 3.4 log. Treatment with 1 IU/ml of IFN- resulted in a

123

moderate (approximately 70%) but significant decrease in virus titer (P<0.05, Student t test). Infectious virus

124

was nearly undetectable upon treatment with 10, 25, and 50 IU/ml of IFN-. The EC50 of IFN-α and IFN-β

125

treatment is 1.35 IU/ml and 0.76 IU/ml, respectively. Taken together, these results indicate that treatment with

126

low concentrations of both IFN-α and IFN-β significantly inhibited viral infection, with IFN- being slightly more

127

effective than IFN-α.

128

129

In addition, we compared the IFN sensitivity of SARS-CoV-2 with that of Vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV), an

130

IFN-sensitive RNA virus. IFN-α or IFN-β were 2-fold serially diluted (250 IU/ml to 0.49 IU/ml) and added to

131

Vero cells for 16 hr. Then cells were infected by VSV (MOI 0.1) or SARS-CoV-2 (MOI 0.01). CPE were

132

observed at 12 hpi for VSV and 72 hpi for SARS-CoV-2. In VSV-infected cells, IFN-α and IFN-β both inhibited

133

CPE development at a concentration of 31.25 IU/ml, while at 15.6 IU/ml the CPE was not discernable from that

134

of IFN-untreated samples. For SARS-CoV2, the lowest concentration that IFN-β or IFN-α inhibited CPE was

135

31.25 IU/ml and 62.5 IU/ml, respectively. The CPE inhibition data suggests that the IFN sensitivity of SARS-

136

CoV-2 is comparable to that of VSV.

Discussion

139

Our data clearly demonstrate that SARS-CoV-2 is highly sensitive to both IFN-α and IFN-β treatment in

140

cultured cells, which is comparable to the IFN-sensitive VSV. Our discovery reveals a weakness of the new

141

coronavirus, which may be informative to antiviral development. The experiment was performed in the IFN-α/β

142

gene-defective Vero cells (6). It is plausible that in IFN-competent cells the efficacy of exogenous IFN-β

143

treatment against SARS-CoV-2 infection is more potent, as IFN-β upregulates other subtypes of Type I IFN

144

expression and augments the IFN-mediated antiviral response (4). Our data may provide an explanation, at

145

least in part, to the observation that approximately 80% of patients actually develop mild symptoms and

146

recover (7). It is possible that many of them are able to mount IFN-α/β-mediated innate immune response upon

147

SARS-CoV-2 infection, which helps to limit virus infection/dissemination at an early stage of disease. At a later

148

stage, the adaptive immune response (antibody etc.) may eventually help patients recover from the COVID-19

149

disease.

150

151

Compared to SARS-CoV-2, it seems that SARS-CoV is relatively less sensitive to IFN treatment in vitro (8, 9).

152

One study reported that the EC50 of IFN-β for SARS-CoV is 95 or 105 IU/ml depending on virus strains (10).

153

Many other highly pathogenic viruses are also resistant to exogenous IFN treatment. For Ebola virus, it has

154

been reported that treatment with exogenous IFN-α does not affect viral replication and infectious virus

155

production in cultured cells (11), probably as a result of antagonism of the IFN response by viral protein. Junín

156

virus, an arenavirus that causes Argentine Hemorrhagic Fever, is likewise insensitive to IFN treatment. When

157

treated with a high concentration of human IFN-α, β or γ (1000 U/ml), the titers of JUNV were reduced by less

158

than 1-log in Vero cells. Further work is warranted to characterize the IFN response during SARS-CoV-2

159

infection to better understand the underlying mechanism behind its IFN sensitivity.

160

161

In vitro, we have demonstrated that SARS-CoV-2 replication is inhibited by IFN-α and IFN- at concentrations

162

that are clinically achievable in patients. Recombinant IFN-αs, Roferon-A and Intron-A, which have been

163

approved for hepatitis B and C treatment, can reach concentrations of up to 330 IU/ml and 204 IU/ml,

164

respectively, in serum (12). Recombinant IFN- drugs, Betaferon and Rebif, which have been approved for the

165

treatment of multiple sclerosis, can reach concentrations of 40 IU/ml and 4.1 IU/ml, respectively, in serum (12).

166

Therefore, some of these drugs may have the potential to be repurposed for the treatment of COVID-19 either

167

alone or in combination with other antiviral therapies.
