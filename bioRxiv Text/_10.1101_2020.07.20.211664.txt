Abstract

29

Coronaviruses play an important role as pathogens of humans and animals, and the emergence

30

of epidemics like SARS, MERS and COVID-19 is closely linked to zoonotic transmission events

31

primarily from wild animals. Bats have been found to be an important source of coronaviruses

32

with some of them having the potential to infect humans, with other animals serving as

33

intermediate or alternate hosts or reservoirs. Host diversity may be an important contributor to

34

viral diversity and thus the potential for zoonotic events. To date, limited research has been done

35

in Africa on this topic, in particular in the Congo Basin despite frequent contact between humans

36

and wildlife in this region. We sampled and, using consensus coronavirus PCR-primers, tested

37

3,561 wild animals for coronavirus RNA. The focus was on bats (38%), rodents (38%), and

38

primates (23%) that posed an elevated risk for contact with people, and we found coronavirus

39

RNA in 121 animals, of which all but two were bats. Depending on the taxonomic family, bats

40

were significantly more likely to be coronavirus RNA-positive when sampled either in the wet

41

(Pteropodidae and Rhinolophidae) or dry season (Hipposideridae, Miniopteridae, Molossidae,

42

and Vespertilionidae). The detected RNA sequences correspond to 15 Alpha- and 6 Beta-

43

coronaviruses, with some of them being very similar (>95% nucleotide identities) to known

44

coronaviruses and others being more unique and potentially representing novel viruses. In seven

45

of the bats, we detected RNA most closely related to sequences of the human common cold

46

coronaviruses 229E or NL63 (>80% nucleotide identities). The findings highlight the potential for

47

coronavirus spillover, especially in regions with a high diversity of bats and close human contact,

48

and reinforces the need for ongoing surveillance.

Introduction

51

Coronaviruses are relatively large enveloped viruses with a single-stranded positive-sense RNA

52

genome of 26-32 kilobases that form their own taxonomic family within the Nidovirales order of

53

viruses [1]. There are two Coronaviridae subfamilies, Letovirinae and Orthocoronavirinae, and the

54

latter contains the genera Alpha- and Betacoronavirus, with viruses infecting mammalian species

55

as well as the genera Gamma- and Deltacoronavirus that primarily contain viruses found in birds

56

[2]. Although known for decades as important enteric and respiratory pathogens in domestic

57

animals, and as causative agent of mild respiratory infections in humans, it was only the

58

emergence of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) in humans in 2002

59

that brought coronaviruses broader attention [3]. The emergence and sporadic re-emergence of

60

Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) since 2012 and the global COVID-

61

19 pandemic caused by SARS-CoV-2 have highlighted the enormous importance of this viral

62

family in the context of global public health [4-6].

63

Coronaviruses identical or closely related to SARS-CoV-1, MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 have

64

been found in civets, camels, and bats, supporting zoonotic events as the most likely source of

65

the respective outbreaks in humans [5, 7-11]. Studies to identify the origin of these zoonotic

66

viruses also led to the discovery of many other, related or completely novel, animal coronaviruses

67

in the process; in particular they have detected an astonishing diversity of alpha- and beta

68

coronaviruses in bats, including relatives of coronaviruses previously identified in other hosts [12-

69

15]. This led to the hypothesis that bats are a reservoir for coronaviruses and that these viruses

70

are crossing into other non-bat species on a somewhat regular basis. As a result, they may

71

establish a novel permanent virus-host relationship, as in the case of MERS-CoV and camels, or

72

a transient relationship as in the case of SARS-CoV-1 and civets. However most interspecies

73

transmissions are likely dead ends for the virus and remain undetected [15-17]. The human

74

common cold viruses HCoV-229E and HCoV-NL63 are most likely animal origin viruses that

75

succeeded in establishing a permanent relationship with humans after crossing species barriers

76

directly or indirectly from bats [12, 13, 18, 19]. Coronaviruses OC43 and HKU-1, which also cause

77

common cold in humans, are likewise expected to have originated in animals, though likely in

78

rodents rather than bats [6, 20].

79

In sum, there is thus mounting biological evidence that spillover has happened repeatedly in the

80

past, continues to happen today, and will likely continue to occur in the future. Hence it is important

81

to study animal coronaviruses to characterize the risks posed by these potentially emerging

82

viruses, to understand the dynamics of the emergence of these pathogens, and to make informed

83

decisions concerning prevention and risk mitigation [15, 21].

84

However, the virus’ biology is only one piece of the puzzle. We know that the emergence and

85

epidemic spread of SARS-CoV-1 and likely SARS-COV-2 are linked to human behavioral factors,

86

such as close contact with wild animals, and with factors such as biodiversity and wildlife

87

abundance, important prerequisites for virus diversity. Hotspots for zoonotic disease emergence

88

generally exist where humans are actively encroaching on such animal habitats [22, 23], as is

89

happening in Southeast Asia and Central Africa. While potential sources of zoonotic

90

coronaviruses are increasingly being explored, a great deal remains to be documented in most

91

parts of the biodiverse African continent, especially in Central Africa. Findings from countries such

92

as Kenya, Madagascar, Rwanda, South Africa and others suggest there are many coronaviruses

93

circulating, primarily in bats, including species related to pathogens such as SARS-CoV-1, MERS-

94

CoV, HCoV-229E and HCoV-NL63 [15, 24-30].

95

In the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC) and the Republic of Congo (ROC) contact with

96

wildlife is common for large parts of the population via the value chain (food or otherwise), as

97

pests in house and fields, at peri-domestic and co-feeding interfaces, or in the context of

98

conservation and tourism [31, 32]. This close contact does not only involve risks for humans, but

99

also potentially for endangered animal species such as great apes [33]. To explore the

100

coronavirus presence in wildlife in this region representing one of the most biodiverse places on

101

the African continent, we launched large scale sampling of primarily bats, rodents and non-human

primates (NHPs). Our goal was to determine the degree of coronavirus circulation and diversity,

103

using a consensus Polymerase Chain reaction (PCR) approach, coupled with the collection of,

104

and coupling with, ecological data.

105
106

Materials and Methods

107

Sample acquisition differed depending on the species and interface. Animals in peri-domestic

108

settings were captured and released after sampling (bats, rodents and shrews only), while

109

samples from the (bushmeat) value chain were collected from freshly killed animals voluntarily

110

provided by local hunters upon their return to the village following hunting, or by vendors at

111

markets. Fecal samples were collected from free-ranging NHPs. Some NHP samples were also

112

collected during routine veterinary exams in zoos and wildlife sanctuaries. Hunters and vendors

113

were not compensated, to avoid incentivizing hunting. Oral and rectal swab samples were

114

collected into individual 2.0 ml screw-top cryotubes containing 1.5 ml of either Universal Viral

115

Transport Medium (BD), RNA later, lysis buffer, or Trizol® (Invitrogen), while pea-sized tissue

116

samples were placed in 1.5ml screw-top cryotubes containing 500ul of either RNA later or lysis

117

buffer (Qiagen), or without medium. All samples were stored in liquid nitrogen as soon as

118

practical. Sample collection staff wore dedicated clothing: N95 masks, nitrile gloves, and

119

protective eyewear during animal capture, handling and sampling.

120

RNA was extracted either manually using Trizol®, with an Qiagen AllPrep kit (tissue), Qiagen

121

Viral RNA Mini Kit (swabs collected prior to 2014), or with a Zymo Direct-zol RNA kit (swabs

122

collected after 2014) and stored at -80ºC. Afterwards RNA was converted into cDNA using a

123

Maxima H Minus First Strand cDNA Synthesis Kit (Thermo Scientific) or GoScript™ Reverse

124

Transcription kit (Promega) and stored at -20°C until analysis. Two conventional nested broad

125

range PCR assays, both targeting conserved regions within the RNA-Dependent RNA

126

Polymerase gene (RdRp) were used to test the samples for coronavirus RNA. The first PCR

amplifies a product of approximately 286nt between the primer binding sites. The first round (CoV-

130

WCC HGG NGA RCA ATT and CoV-RVS2: GGW AWC CCC AYT GYT GWA YRT C) primers of

131

this PCR were specifically designed for the detection of a broad range of coronaviruses [34]. The

132

second PCR was used in two modified versions: one of them specifically targeting a broad range

133

of coronaviruses in bats, the second one broadly targeting coronaviruses of other hosts. In both

134

cases, the first round of the semi nested PCR utilized the primers CoV-FWD3 (GGT TGG GAY

135

TAY CCH AAR TGT GA) and CoV-RVS3 (CCA TCA TCA SWY RAA TCA TCA TA). In the second

136

round, either CoV-FWD4/Bat (GAY TAY CCH AAR TGT GAY AGA GC) or CoV-FWD4/Other

137

(GAY TAY CCH AAR TGT GAU MGW GC) were used as forward primers, while the reverse

138

primer was again CoV-RVS3 [35]. Both versions amplify 387nt between the primer binding sites.

139

PCR products were subjected to gel electrophoresis on a 1.5% agarose gel and products of the

140

expected amplicon sizes were excised. DNA was extracted using the Qiagen QIAquick Gel

141

Extraction Kit and either sequenced by Sanger sequencing at the UC Davis DNA sequencing

142

facility or was sent for commercial Sanger sequencing (GATC or Macrogen). Extracts with low

143

DNA concentrations were cloned prior to sequencing. All results from sequencing were analyzed

144

in the Geneious 7.1 software, and primer trimmed consensus sequences compared to the

145

GenBank database (BLAST N, NCBI).

sequences with nucleotide identities of more than 95%. Multiple sequence alignments were made

155

in Geneious (version 11.1.3, ClustalW Alignment). Bayesian phylogeny of the polymerase gene

156

fragment was inferred using MrBayes (version 3.2) with the following parameters: Datatype=DNA,

157

Nucmodel=4by4, Nst=1, Coavion=No, # States=4, Rates=Equal, 2 runs, 4 chains of 5,000,000

158

generations. The sequence of an avian Gamma Coronavirus (NC_001451) served as outgroup

159

to root the trees, and trees were sampled after every 1,000 steps during the process to monitor

160

phylogenetic convergence [36]. The average standard deviation of split frequencies was below

161

0.006 for the Watanabe PCR amplicon based analysis and below 0.0029 for the Quan PCR

162

amplicon based analysis (MrBayes recommended final average <0.01). The first 10% of the trees

163

were discarded and the remaining ones combined using TreeAnnotator (version 2.5.1;

164

http://beast.bio.ed.ac.uk) and displayed with FIGTREE (1.4.4; http://tree.bio.ed.ac.uk/) [37].

165

Ecological data related to the locality and the host animals was compiled and analyzed with

166

respect to a correlation with the frequency of virus detection. The data included sex, human

167

interface at which the animals were collected and sampled (value chain or other), and local

168

calendric season (wet/dry) based on the climate-data.org data set, and were evaluated using two-

Results

172

Between 2006 and 2018 a total of 3,561 animals (2,630 from DRC and 931 from RoC) were

173

sampled and tested, of which 1,356 were bats (24 genera), 1,347 rodents (33 genera), 836 NHPs

174

(14 genera), and 22 shrews, (Figure 1, Supplements 1 and 2). The majority of the 5,586 collected

175

samples were oral (2,258) or rectal (2,238) swabs, with others being tissue samples, including

176

liver and spleen (385), lung (187) or intestinal tract (175), as well as feces (167), blood, serum or

177

plasma (140) and others (36). Coronavirus RNA was detected in oral (23) and/or rectal (102)

178

swabs and one pooled liver and spleen sample from a total of 121 animals. Viral RNA was

179

amplified in 83 samples using the Watanabe PCR assay and in 73 samples using the Quan PCR

assay (Supplement 3). Two of the animals with detected coronavirus RNA were rodents (<1% of

181

sampled rodents), while 119 were bats (8.8% of sampled bats). Coronavirus RNA positive animals

182

were found in 25% (27/106) of bat sampling events (same location and same day) and <1%

183

(2/235) of rodent sampling events (Supplements 2-4). In 10 of the bat sampling events, a single

184

coronavirus RNA positive bat was among the tested animals, while in 17 events the number of

185

bats positive for coronavirus ranged from 2 to 16 (Supplement 3). RNA was detected in two

186

species of rodents, one Deomys ferrugineus (1/1) and one Malacomys longipes (1/38), and in at

187

least 14 different bat species, namely Chaerephon pumilus, Eidolon helvum, Epomops franqueti,

188

Hipposideros caffer, Hipposideros gigas, Hipposideros ruber, Megaloglossus woermanni,

189

Micropteropus pusillus, Miniopterus inflatus, Mops condylurus, Myonycteris sp., Rhinolophus sp.,

190

Scotophilus dinganii and Triaenops persicus (Table 1, Supplement 3). Among the five bat species

191

from which more than 100 individuals were sampled and tested, Eidolon helvum had the highest

192

rate of coronavirus RNA positives (22.3%), followed by Epomops franqueti (15.8%),

193

Megaloglossus woermanni (8.5%), Mops condylurus (7.6%), and Micropteropus pusillus (7%)

194

(Table 1). With 10.2% Yinpterchiroptera bats had a significantly (N=0.015 C2Y) higher rate of

195

coronavirus RNA positive animals than Yangochiroptera bats with 5.0% (Table 1). No coronavirus

196

RNA positive animals were detected among the sampled NHPs or shrews.

197

Significant seasonal differences for the rate of coronavirus RNA positive animals were detected

198

across the bats with a 10.5% PCR positive rate in the wet season and a 6.6% rate in the dry

199

season (p = 0.0176) (Table 1, Supplement 4). Bats that were associated with the (bushmeat)

200

value chain were more frequently positive for coronavirus RNA (25.4%) than bats sampled at

201

other human animal (peri-domestic) interfaces (5%), and this difference was highly significant (p

202

< 0.0001). Male bats were significantly overrepresented among the Coronavirus RNA positives p

203

= 0.0183), while there was insufficient data to analyze an influence of age (Supplement 2).

204

Upon phylogenetic analysis, the sequences fall into 13 separate clusters based on the Quan PCR

205

amplicon and 13 separate clusters based on the Watanabe PCR amplicon. Based on amplicons

206

obtained with both PCRs from the same sample or animal, the respective Quan and Watanabe

207

sequence clusters Alpha 5, 6, and 7 (Q7=W2), as well as Beta 1, 2, and 3 correspond to each

208

other. In one bat, RNA corresponding to two different alphacoronaviruses was detected in the oral

209

and the rectal sample by the same PCR assay (ZB12030), while in another bat one PCR assay

210

amplified RNA indicating an Alpha- and the other assay an RNA indicating a betacoronavirus

211

(GVF-RC-1006) (Supplement 3). Given the overall results, RNA of 15 different Alpha- and 6

212

betacoronaviruses was detected in the study population. In 22 of the sampling events, only a

213

single type/strain of these coronaviruses was detected, two in two events, and three, five or eight

214

in one event each. Identical or very similar coronavirus sequences were found with a spatial

215

distance of up to 1975 km apart and a temporal distance of up to 1708 days (Supplement 5).

216

Although the two coronavirus sequences we detected in rodents were clustering with known

217

sequences from bat alphacoronaviruses, there were no sequences in GenBank that shared more

218

than 80% identities with either of them (Figure 2, Supplement 3). The detected bat coronavirus

219

sequences on the contrary mostly clustered closely with known ones, that to a large part were

220

detected in hosts from the same genus (Figures 2 and 3). The majority of the detected sequences

221

were closely related to only two known viruses. Sequences with nucleotide identities of 97% or

222

higher to Kenya bat coronavirus BtKY56 were found in 53 individual bats of 9 different species

223

sampled on 14 occasions (Q-/W-Beta 2), while sequences with identities of 99% or higher to

224

Eidolon bat coronavirus/Kenya/KY24 were detected in 30 individual bats of 3 different species

225

sampled on 8 occasions (Q-/W-Beta 3) (Supplements 3 & 5). Bat coronavirus sequences in

226

clusters Q-Alpha 1, 2, 7, and 8, W-Alpha 2 and 7, Q-/W-Beta 1, and Q-Beta 4 and 5 had identities

227

of below 95% with known coronaviruses.

228

In three cases (Q-Alpha 1, W-Alpha 7 and 8), sequences were closest to coronaviruses found in

229

bats and camels with a high similarity (>90% nucleotide identities) to human coronavirus 229E

230

(Figures 2 and 3). Similarly, the viral sequences in clusters Q-Alpha 2 and Q-/W-Alpha 6 were

most closely related to bat coronaviruses with some similarity (>80% nucleotide identities) to

232

human coronavirus NL63 (Figures 2 and 3).

234

Discussion

235

We detected coronavirus RNA in a significant proportion of the sampled bats (8.8%), but only in

236

a small proportion of rodents (<1%) and none in NHPs or shrews. Finding relatively high numbers

237

of coronavirus RNA positive bats is consistent with what has been previously reported; continuous

238

high circulation of coronaviruses seems to be common especially in bats in tropical and

239

subtropical climates [15]. The specific PCR positive rates need to be approached with caution

240

though, since factors such as species, season, location and others could play a role, as well as

241

sample material and assays used for detection in comparison to other studies.

242

Our data suggest that coronavirus circulation in bats, at least in the Congo Basin, may indeed

243

depend to some extent on species and seasonality (Supplement 4). We observed a significant

244

difference in the number of bats testing positive depending on the local calendric season (p =

245

0.0176), with 10.5% of coronavirus RNA positive bats in the wet season but only 6.6% in the dry

246

season at similar sample sizes for both seasons (Table 1). Interestingly, when looking at the family

247

and species level, this holds true only for the Pteropodidae and Rhinolophidae species (p <

248

0.0001) while Hipposideridae, Miniopteridae, Molossidae, and Vespertilionidae species are more

249

likely to be positive for coronavirus RNA in the dry season (p < 0.0001) (Table 1). The latter,

250

though not for those specific families but for bats in general, has been proposed to be the

251

correlation on a global scale [15]. We can only speculate as to the reasons of the apparent

252

seasonality, but family and species seem to be important determinants. Due to the diverse set of

253

species in our sample set, individual sample numbers for most species are too small to draw

254

definite conclusions, however the significant seasonal difference between Yinpterchiroptera and

255

Yangochiroptera are largely supported by respective trends in the individual species. We tested

256

if the results from any particular species might be responsible for the observed correlation

257

between season and the rate of positive coronavirus RNA animals. The only species that turned

258

out to have a strong influence on the outcome was Eidolon helvum. However, the effect of

259

dropping it from the analysis did only influence the outcome for bats in total, while it was not strong

260

enough to negate the observed statistical significances for season within the Pteropodidae family

261

or the Yinpterchiroptera suborder.

262

We did find Eidolon helvum, a bat usually roosting in large colonies, to be significantly

263

overrepresented among the coronavirus positive bats (p = 0.0005), and higher detection rates in

264

this species have been reported before [15, 39]. However, samples from Eidolon helvum in this

265

study were collected from animals sold at two different markets on seven different days, and

266

although we detected coronavirus RNA in some Eidolon helvum bats obtained at each of those

267

occasions, it is possible that many of these bats came from the same roosts. The fact that all but

268

one of the Eidolon helvum bats were found to be positive for the same coronavirus type (Q-/W-

269

Beta-3) supports the assertion that there may be a connection between those bats. Our dataset

270

does contain evidence that bat coronaviruses are readily shared within local bat populations. In

271

fact, 109 out of 119 coronavirus positive bats were from sampling events with at least one other

272

coronavirus RNA positive bat, and in all but six of these cases there was another bat with the

273

same coronavirus type in the event-cohort (Supplements 3 and 5). Even though we cannot

274

pinpoint the exact roosting relationship between all of these bats, this does confirm that

275

coronaviruses are readily shared among the bats in an area, even across species boundaries. It

276

also highlights that several different coronaviruses can circulate in parallel, including occasional

277

double infections (Supplement 3).

278

We found a much higher percentage of bats that were part of the bushmeat value chain to be

279

positive for coronavirus RNA, which could have significant implications for the risk of coronavirus

280

spillover from bats into humans. In our data set, 81% of the value chain samples were collected

281

in the wet season, and this group also contained all of the Eidolon helvum samples. This suggests

282

that seasonality and preferentially hunted species (80% Pteropodidae) are likely responsible for

283

the higher rate of coronavirus RNA positive animals in the value chain. According to our data, it

284

also seems that male animals are overrepresented among bats with coronavirus positive

285

samples. It is possible that behavioral differences between males and females play a role, such

286

as reduced activity of females during the time of birthing and breastfeeding or higher stress levels

287

among males during the breeding season [40]. Further investigation is required to confirm and

288

assess the reasons for this observation.

289

It appears clear from our findings, that bats rather than rodents or primates are sustaining a

290

significant circulation of coronaviruses in the Congo Basin. Evidence for coronavirus circulation

291

in wild animals other than bats is generally much scarcer, even though civets, raccoon, dogs, and

292

camels have been shown to be involved in outbreaks of SARS and MERS [8, 11, 15].

293

We estimate that the 121 detected sequences correspond to 21 different coronaviruses based on

294

the differences between the amplified sequences, considering the conserved nature of the

295

amplified fragments within the RdRp open reading frame (ORF). These 21 coronaviruses include

296

some that appear to only be distantly related to already described coronaviruses, and others that

297

have already been found elsewhere, such as Kenya bat coronavirus BtKY56 and Eidolon bat

298

coronavirus/Kenya/KY24 (Figures 2 and 3, Supplement 3).

299

RNA of either Kenya bat coronavirus BtKY56 or Eidolon bat coronavirus/Kenya/KY24 was

300

detected in ~70% (83) of the positive bats in this study and in several hundred bats reported

301

previously (GenBank). Interestingly Kenya bat coronavirus BtKY56 appears to be a common virus

302

species

303

coronavirus/Kenya/KY24 that is more common. These observations are undoubtedly susceptible

304

to a sampling bias, for example due to the species composition of sample sets, particularly with

305

Eidolon helvum, which can be sampled in large numbers when colonies are present or when they

306

are present in markets [41]. However, we do find evidence of these two viruses in a relative wide

307

array of bat hosts, indicating that species barriers may not be a limiting factor for sharing these

308

specific Beta coronaviruses (Figures 2 and 3, Supplement 3). In contrast, most of the other

309

sequences that we detected with related sequences in GenBank were detected in bats of the

310

same genus by us and previously by others, supporting some degree of general species

311

specificity and virus host co-evolution despite the latent ability of at least some coronaviruses to

312

jump species barriers within and outside of the taxonomic order of hosts [14, 15, 17]. How often

313

these events occur is not fully understood, but it is generally assumed that bats serve as a

314

reservoir for coronaviruses [16]. With SARS-CoV-1 and SARS-CoV-2, the available evidence

315

suggests that they were successfully transmitted from bats into humans, either directly or

316

indirectly [20]. When we add to these two coronaviruses MERS that originated in bats and

317

established a sustained reservoir in camels with occasional spillover into humans, we have

318

witnessed three coronavirus spillover events with a bat origin in less than two decades.

319

Considering our increased awareness and abilities to detect the emergence of novel viruses, it

320

can be assumed that there may have been multiple coronavirus zoonotic events in the past that

321

either led to some degree of either self-limiting outbreaks, or may have established a permanent

322

virus host relationship with a new host [42]. MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV-1 may represent

323

examples for the former, while the latter may be represented by human coronaviruses 229E and

324

NL63; the ultimate outcome with regards to SARS-CoV-2 remains undetermined however. In our

325

study we also detected viral RNA related to human coronaviruses 229E and NL63 in eight bats.

326

Whether or not these relatives of human pathogens or other strains of the coronaviruses currently

327

circulating in bats can and will jump into humans in the future is difficult to predict at present.

328

Progress in the understanding of molecular processes such as RNA polymerase proofreading

329

capability, receptor usage, as well as in the field of human behavior are however certainly helping

330

our understanding of risk [43]. The close contact of humans with wildlife including bats in the

331

Congo Basin, especially in the context of hunting and wild animal trade, are certainly factors

332

contributing to a higher risk for zoonotic events involving coronaviruses or other infectious agents.

333

The two sequences we detected in rodents (Deomys ferrugineus and Malacomys longipes) likely

334

correspond to novel Alpha coronaviruses. The lack of sequences closely related to the two

335

indicates that rodent coronaviruses may be an understudied field, especially considering that

336

rodents are the largest family of mammals.

337

We conclude overall, that bats and to a much smaller degree rodents in the Congo Basin harbor

338

diverse coronaviruses, of which some might have the molecular potential for spillover into

339

humans. Considering the close contact between wildlife and humans in the region, as part of the

340

value chain or in peri-domestic settings, there is an elevated and potentially increasing risk for

341

zoonotic events involving coronaviruses. Thus, continued work to understand the diversity,

342

distribution, molecular mechanisms, host ecology, as well as consistent surveillance of

343

coronaviruses at likely hotspots, are critical to help prevent future global pandemics.
