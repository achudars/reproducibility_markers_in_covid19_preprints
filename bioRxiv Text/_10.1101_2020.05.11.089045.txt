Summary
ACE2, in concert with the protease TMPRSS2, binds the novel coronavirus SARS-CoV2 and facilitates its cellular entry. The ACE2 gene is expressed in SARS-CoV-2 target
cells, including Type II Pneumocytes (Ziegler, 2020), and is activated by interferons. Viral
RNA was also detected in breast milk (Wu et al., 2020), raising the possibility that ACE2
expression is under the control of cytokines through the JAK-STAT pathway. Here we
show that Ace2 expression in mammary tissue is induced during pregnancy and lactation,
which coincides with the establishment of a candidate enhancer. The prolactin-activated
transcription factor STAT5 binds to tandem sites that coincide with activating histone
enhancer marks and additional transcription components. The presence of pan JAKSTAT components in mammary alveolar cells and in Type II Pneumocytes combined with
the autoregulation of both STAT1 and STAT5 suggests a prominent role of cytokine
signaling pathways in cells targeted by SARS-CoV-2.
Introduction
ACE2, the receptor for SARS-CoV (Imai et al., 2005) and SARS-CoV-2 (Hoffmann et al.,
2020), has been identified in several target cells, including absorptive Enterocytes
(Lamers et al., 2020), secretory goblet cells (Zhao, 2020), the olfactory system (Brann,
2020) and several epithelial cell types (Brann, 2020; Lukassen et al., 2020; Qi et al.,
2020). A study in pneumocytes demonstrated that ACE2 expression is induced by
interferons (Ziegler, 2020), possibly through the transcription factors Signal Transducer
and Activator of Transcription (STAT) 1 and 2, as the authors suggest. The STAT family

is comprised of seven transcription factors (STAT1, 2, 3, 4, 5A, 5B and 6) that are
activated by type I and II cytokines through their respective receptors and the JAK/TYK2
family of tyrosine kinases (Stark and Darnell, 2012). Although each cytokine receptor has
some preference for individual STAT members, it has become clear that any given
cytokine can activate several, if not all, STAT members, which subsequently bind to a
shared DNA motif, the gamma interferon activated sequence (GAS) (Hennighausen and
Robinson, 2008). This permits individual genes to be activated by more than one cytokine
through different receptors and several STAT family members.
While SARS-CoV-2 infection of lung epithelium is driving the disease, disturbances
in other cell types (Qi et al., 2020), such as the olfactory system (Brann, 2020), have been
observed. SARS-CoV-2 RNA has also been detected in breast milk of infected patients
(Wu et al., 2020) suggesting that the virus can enter differentiated mammary alveolar cells
and be vertically transmitted through breast feeding. Based on the overlapping activities
of JAK-STAT components and their potential redundancy, it is likely that ACE2 expression
is activated by a wide range of cytokines through STATs 1, 2, 3 and 5. This has profound
implications for strategies to mitigate ACE2 levels. Interfering with individual STATs will
result in the compensational recruitment of other STAT members to cytokine receptors
(Cui et al., 2007) with all its transcriptional consequences (Hennighausen and Robinson,
2008; Shin et al., 2016).
Results and Discussion
Ace2 mRNA levels vary widely between cell types, with high expression detected in
lactating mammary and intestinal tissues (Figure 1A-B) and Type II Pneumocytes
(Ziegler, 2020). To explore the possibility that Ace2 gene expression in SARS-CoV-2
target cells is regulated not only by interferons but also by a range of cytokines through
the family of STAT transcription factors, we mined available scRNA-seq data (Ziegler,
2020) (Table 1). Interferon receptors (IFNAR) and its downstream mediators JAK1, JAK2,
TYK2 as well as STATs 1, 3 and 5 are highly expressed, thus supporting the mechanism
of ACE2 induction by IFN-a/b and IFN-g. STAT1 levels increase sharply in cells treated
with IFNs, supporting the notion of an autoregulatory loop (Yuasa and Hijikata, 2016).
Moreover, these expression data point to the presence of functional STAT3 and STAT5

signaling cascades. Interleukin receptors, such as IL-7R, that are dependent on the
common gamma chain (IL2RG), JAK1 and JAK3 are also highly expressed.
The presence of a wide range of cytokine receptors, JAKs and STATs, suggests
that Ace2 might be activated by a broad selection of extracellular cues and most
cytokines, including growth hormone and prolactin. We have tested this premise and
explored whether Ace2 is activated in mouse mammary tissue through STAT transcription
factors. Gene expression in mammary epithelium during pregnancy and lactation is
activated by prolactin through STAT5 (Liu et al., 1997). We observed an approximately
100-fold increase of Ace2 mRNA during pregnancy and lactation (Figure 1B), which
coincided with the establishment of a putative enhancer (Figure 2A). Tmprss2 mRNA
levels were similar throughout pregnancy and lactation (Figure 1B), suggesting that its
expression is not under overt control of the JAK/STAT pathway. STAT5 was recruited to
two distinct GAS (bona fide STAT binding motifs) in the candidate enhancer and cooccupancy of the glucocorticoid receptor (GR), nuclear factor 1 B (NFIB) and mediator
complex subunit 1 (MED1) is likely not through their individual recognition motifs but
through contacting STAT5. The presence of H3K4me1 enhancer marks, H3K27ac marks
and RNA polymerase II (Pol II) occupancy further supports the validity of this regulatory
region. Of note, no STAT3 occupancy was observed, suggesting a predominance of
STAT5. In contrast to mammary tissue, limited STAT5 binding was observed in liver and
no STAT5 and STAT3 binding was observed in kidney tissue (Figure 2B). The putative
autoregulatory enhancer in the Stat1 gene served as a positive control for STAT binding
(Figure 2C).
Our study demonstrates the presence of pan JAK/STAT components in Type II
Pneumocytes, suggesting that ACE2 is not only activated by IFN-a/b and IFN-g but also
by other cytokines. Moreover, we demonstrate an ~100-fold increase of Ace2 expression
by pregnancy and lactation hormones in mouse mammary tissue. Future inquiries aimed
at understanding the mechanism of ACE2 gene regulation in potential SARS-CoV-2
target cells need to address the pan JAK-STAT pathway as well as steroid hormones,
which might explain some of the sex differences seen in Covid-19 morbidity and mortality.

human tissues, both in males and females at different ages. Since underlying preexisting
conditions, such as obesity, diabetes and high blood pressure, can affect the severity and
progression of Covid-19, it would prudent to take this into account when analyzing the
control of Ace2 regulation.
Materials and Methods
Chromatin immunoprecipitation sequencing (ChIP-seq) analysis. Quality filtering
and alignment of the raw reads was done using Trimmomatic (Bolger et al., 2014) (version
0.36) and Bowtie (Langmead et al., 2009) (version 1.1.2), with the parameter ‘-m 1’ to
keep only uniquely mapped reads, using the reference genome mm10. Picard tools
(Broad Institute. Picard, http://broadinstitute.github.io/picard/. 2016) was used to remove
duplicates and subsequently, Homer (Heinz et al., 2010) (version 4.8.2) and deepTools
(Ramirez et al., 2016) (version 3.1.3) software was applied to generate bedGraph files,
seperately. Integrative Genomics Viewer (Thorvaldsdottir et al., 2013) (version 2.3.81)
was used for visualization. Coverage plots were generated using Homer (Heinz et al.,
2010) software with the bedGraph from deepTools as input. R and the packages dplyr
(https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=dplyr) and ggplot2 (Love et al., 2014) were used
for visualization. Each ChIP-seq experiment was conducted for two replicates. Sequence
read numbers were calculated using Samtools (Masella et al., 2016) software with sorted
bam files. The correlation between the ChIP-seq replicates was computed using
deepTools using Spearman correlation.
RNA-seq analysis. RNA-seq reads were analyzed using Trimmomatic (Bolger et al.,
2014) (version 0.36) to check read quality (with following parameters: LEADING: 3,
TRAILING: 3, SLIDINGWINDOW: 4:20, MINLEN: 36). The alignment was performed in
Bowtie aligner (Langmead et al., 2009) (version 1.1.2) using paired end mode.
Data availability
RNA-seq data from human and mouse tissues shown in Figure 1a were obtained from
ENCODE. RNA-seq data shown in Fig. 1b and ChIP-seq data shown in Figure 2 were
generated in our lab and deposited in the Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) and
