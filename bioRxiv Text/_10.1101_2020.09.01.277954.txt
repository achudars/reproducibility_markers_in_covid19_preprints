Abstract
Angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) is a key regulator of the renin-angiotensin system, but also the
functional receptor of the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). Based on
structural similarity with other γ-secretase (γS) targets, we hypothesized that ACE2 may be affected by γS
proteolytic activity. We found that after ectodomain shedding, ACE2 is targeted for intramembrane
proteolysis by γS, releasing a soluble ACE2 C-terminal fragment. Consistently, chemical or genetic
inhibition of γS results in the accumulation of a membrane-bound fragment of ectodomain-deficient
ACE2. Although chemical inhibition of γS does not alter SARS-CoV-2 cell entry, these data point to a
novel pathway for cellular ACE2 trafficking.

Introduction
Angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) is a membrane-anchored ectoenzyme that processes
Angiotensin II to Angiotensin 1-7, but also mediates the entry of three different coronavirus strains by
means of binding the viral spike (S) protein: NL63 (1), SARS-CoV (2) and SARS-CoV-2 (3). S-protein
binding to ACE2 triggers membrane fusion and viral entry, but only after S-protein priming by
Transmembrane protease serine 2 (TMPRSS2) (3, 4), which also cleaves the ectodomain of ACE2 (5).
ACE2 cleavage, or shedding, can additionally be induced by the disintegrin and metallopeptidase domain
17 (ADAM17) (6), which was found to compete with TMPRSS2 (5). In this regard, there are conflicting
reports of ADAM17-mediated shedding affecting SARS-CoV entry (5, 7). Viral infection has also been
shown to trigger ACE2 endocytosis (8), leading to reduced cell surface expression of ACE2 (9).
Intriguingly, ACE2 is seen as a “double-edged sword” (10). While high expression of the receptor enables
viral infection, some of the deleterious effects associated with COVID-19 are attributed to loss of ACE2mediated cardiovascular protection, due to cell surface downregulation (11). In the current COVID-19
pandemic, there has been great interest in novel therapeutics that modulate ACE2, either to prevent
SARS-CoV-2 entry (12) or to target the renin-angiotensin system imbalance associated with severe
disease (11). Ideally, novel ACE2-focused therapies should be able to disentangle these two faces of the
receptor.
The gamma-secretase (γS) protein complex, composed of a Presenilin 1/2 aspartyl protease
catalytic core with regulatory (Aph-1a or -1b), enhancer (PEN2) and targeting (Nicastrin) subunits, is the
prototype intramembrane-cleaving protease (I-CLiP). I-CLiP proteases introduce a water molecule into
the hydrophobic environment of the lipid bilayer for peptide bond hydrolysis within the transmembrane
domain. γS targets are typically single-pass, type I transmembrane proteins with large ectodomains and Cterminal intracellular domains (ICD). γS substrates first undergo ectodomain shedding at the cell surface,
rendering a membrane-bound protein stub that is targeted by γS for intramembrane proteolysis. The
released soluble ICD tends to be rapidly degraded by the proteasome, but in some cases, such as the
Notch family of cell surface receptors (13) and the amyloid β precursor protein (APP) (14), the ICD has
signaling activity. For example, Notch ICD binds a Mastermind/Rbpj complex to activate transcription of
canonical Notch target genes (15). But in addition to Notch and APP, dozens of other putative γS targets
have been identified (16), not determined by an amino acid consensus sequence, but rather specific
transmembrane conformational structure and accessibility (17, 18). Validation of novel γS targets is
hindered by the lack of clear-cut common features and ectodomain shedding requirements.
Based on structural similarity of ACE2 to known γS targets, we hypothesized that γS regulates
intramembrane cleavage of ACE2 and may impact SARS-CoV-2 biology. Here we report that ACE2
undergoes TMPRSS2/ADAM17-dependent γS cleavage, resulting in a short-lived ACE2-ICD. Genetic or
chemical inhibition of γS prevents ACE2-ICD generation, leading to accumulation of a membrane-bound
ACE2 lacking the ectodomain. However, we show using a pseudovirus system that γS inhibition does not
impact SARS-CoV-2 cellular entry.

Experimental Procedures
Antibodies and chemicals — We used antibodies against GFP (B-2) sc-9996, Nicastrin (N-19) sc-14369,
Rhodopsin (ID4) sc-57432, C9 tag (TETSQVAPA peptide) from Santa Cruz Biotechnology; Actin,
A2066 from Millipore-Sigma; Presenilin 1 (D39D1) 5643, from Cell Signaling Technology; and ACE2
ab15348, from Abcam. We used MG132 and phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (PMA) (Sigma). γS
inhibitors (GSI) were Compound E (Axxora) and dibenzazepine (DBZ) (Syncom). DBZ was used in all
experiments indicating GSI usage unless otherwise stated.
Cell culture and cell lines — We used Presenilin-deficient (Psen1/2 double knockout) and control mouse
embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs) provided by Nikolaos Robakis (Mount Sinai School of Medicine, New
York, NY) (19) and Nicastrin knockout and control MEFs were obtained from Phillip Wong (Johns
Hopkins University School of Medicine, Baltimore, MD) (20). We cultured MEFs, Caco-2, VeroE6 and
293T cells in DMEM supplemented with 10% heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum (FBS) and 1%
penicillin-streptomycin (Thermo-Fisher). For transfection experiments, we used Lipofectamine 3000 and
OptiMEM (Thermo-Fisher) as per the manufacturer’s instructions.
Plasmids — We obtained a vector encoding C-terminally tagged ACE2 (TETSQVAPA, C9-tag) from
Hyeryun Choe, obtained from Addgene (#1786) (2). We replaced C9 with EGFP to generate ACE2-GFP,
which we in turn deposited on Addgene (#154962). We obtained a TMPRSS2 expression vector from
Roger Reeves, obtained from Addgene (21).
Western blotting, immunoprecipitation and quantitative PCR — We lysed cells in RIPA buffer containing
protease inhibitors (Pierce protease inhibitor tablets, Thermo-Fisher), and 10 mM NaF. For
immunoprecipitation of γS, we lysed cells in 1% CHAPSO, 100 mM NaCl, 2 mM EDTA, 25 mM TrisHCl (pH 7.4), with protease inhibitors, and immunoprecipitated 1.2 mg of protein lysate with 2.5 µg C9tag antibody and Protein G magnetic beads (Cell Signaling Biotechnology). After overnight incubation,
we separated beads with a DynaMag-2 magnet (Thermo-Fisher), and washed three times in buffer
containing 0.5% CHAPSO. We resuspended beads in 2× Laemmli buffer and heated at 70ºC for 10 min,
prior to SDS-PAGE, Western blot and visualization with the ECL Western Blotting Detection Kit (GE
Healthcare Bio-Sciences). We performed qPCR as previously described (22) with primers specific for
human (h) Caco-2 cells; or Chlorocebus sabaeus (cs) VeroE6 cells as follows: h/csACE2:
TGGTGGGAGATGAAGCGAGA, AACATGGAACAGAGATGCGGG; hTMPRSS2:
CACCGAGGAGAAAGGGAAGAC, CATGGCTGGTGTGATCAGGT; csADAM17:
AGGTGTCCAGTGCAGTGATAGG, ATCTTCAGCATTTCCCGGAGG; hADAM17:
CGTTGGGTCTGTCCTGGTTT, TCAGCATTTCGACGTTACTGGG. We normalized with
peptidylprolyl isomerase A using the following primers: csPPIA: CAGGTCCTGGCATCTTGTCC,
GCTTGCCATCCAACCACTCA; hPPIA: TATCTGCACTGCCAAGACTGAGTG,
CTTCTTGCTGGTCTTGCCATTCC.
Immunofluorescence and confocal imaging — We seeded cells on glass coverslips as previously
described (23), and gathered images with an Axio Observer Z1 with an LSM 710 scanning module
(Zeiss), collected using a 63× Zeiss Plan-Apochromat oil objective. All images were obtained in a 1,024by 1,024-pixel format and processed with ZEN2 (Zeiss).
SARS-CoV-2 pseudovirus and cell entry inhibition — Recombinant Indiana vesicular stomatitis virus
(rVSV) expressing SARS-CoV-2 S-protein, and the neutralizing antibody used as control, were generated
as previously described (24). We grew 293T cells to 80% confluency before transfection with pCMV3SARS-CoV-2-spike using FuGENE 6 (Promega), and cultured cells overnight at 37°C with 5% CO2. The
next day, we removed medium and infected cells with VSV-G pseudo-typed ΔG-luciferase (G*ΔG-

times. We added DMEM supplemented with anti-VSV-G antibody (I1, mouse hybridoma supernatant
from CRL-2700; ATCC) to the infected cells and harvested the supernatant the next day. To test DBZ
inhibition of SARS-CoV-2 cell entry, we seeded VeroE6 or Caco-2 cells in a 96-well plate at a
concentration of 2 × 104 cells per well. We incubated pseudovirus the next day with serial dilutions of
DBZ in triplicate for 30 min at 37 °C. We added the mixture to cultured cells and incubated for an
additional 24 h, with an S-protein neutralizing antibody was used as control (24). We measured
luminescence using a Britelite plus Reporter Gene Assay System (PerkinElmer).

RESULTS
ACE2 ectodomain shedding is required for γS cleavage
Consistent with other confirmed γS targets (i.e. APP (14), Notch (13) and Jagged1 (25)), ACE2 has a
large ectodomain that can be processed by a sheddase (ADAM17/TMPRSS2) (5, 6) and a single
transmembrane domain (Fig. 1A). Based on this structural similarity, we hypothesized that after
ectodomain shedding, the resultant protein (ACE2ΔE) may represent a novel γS target. To test this
hypothesis, we expressed ACE2 tagged at its C-terminus in 293T cells, and triggered ectodomain
shedding by either TMPRSS2 co-expression, or PMA-induced activation of endogenous sheddases (26).
In the presence of TMPRSS2, we observed a 15 kDa C-terminal ACE2 fragment which accumulated in
the presence of a γS inhibitor (GSI), dibenzazepine (DBZ) (Fig. 1B). PMA treatment rendered a 18 kDa
C-terminal fragment, consistent with the expected size after ADAM17-mediated ACE2 cleavage (6).
Similar to TMPRSS2 co-expression, this longer form of ACE2ΔE also accumulated in DBZ treated cells
(Fig. 1C). Intriguingly, we observed ACE2ΔE accumulation even in unstimulated cells expressing ACE2
(Fig. 1B, C), suggesting endogenous ectodomain shedding followed by γS cleavage is part of the normal
turnover of ACE2. We also used a chemically distinct GSI (Compound E) (Fig. 1D), that confirmed that
ACE2ΔE is targeted by γS.
Most γS-liberated target protein ICDs are extremely labile and rapidly degraded in the
proteasome (16). As the cytoplasmic portion of ACE2 is too small for conventional SDS-PAGE, we
generated a C-terminal ACE2-GFP fusion protein to detect ACE2-ICD production. We repeated the
above experiments using this novel construct and found that TMPRS2 co-expression or PMA treatment
provoked ectodomain shedding and ACE2ΔE-GFP accumulation with DBZ treatment (Fig. 1E, F). As
hypothesized, we also observed ACE2-ICD-GFP only after proteasome inhibition (Fig 1E, F).
Based on these pharmacologic data, we next hypothesized that ACE2ΔE and γS would physically
interact. To test this, we performed co-immunoprecipitation of endogenous γS with C-terminally tagged
ACE2, and observed association with both Nicastrin and Presenilin1 with ACE2ΔE but not full-length
ACE2, consistent with other bona fide γS targets (18). γS-ACE2ΔE interaction did not change in the
presence of DBZ (Fig. 1G). In sum, these data establish ACE2 as a novel γS target.
ACE2 cleavage-dependent localization is altered in γS-deficient cells
To determine cellular ramifications of γS-mediated ACE2 cleavage, we next evaluated ACE2 processing
in Nicastrin knockout (Ncstn KO) (20) or Presenilin1/2 double knockout (Psen1/2 dKO) MEFs (19), both
of which have disrupted γS activity. Consistent with GSI treatment, these γS-deficient cell lines displayed
ACE2ΔE accumulation, accentuated by co-expression of TMPRSS2 (Fig. 2A). In this experimental
paradigm, the C-terminus of ACE2 is primarily localized to the membrane but appeared diffusely
cytoplasmic with TMPRSS2 expression in control cells (Fig. 2B and 2C, top panels). In γS-deficient cells
however, ACE2 remained membrane-associated even in the presence of TMPRSS2 (Fig. 2B and 2C,
bottom panels). We reproduced these results using a C-terminal ACE2-GFP fusion protein (Fig. 2D), and
with DBZ treatment of γS in control cells (Fig. 2E). These results indicate that γS is required for the
release of a soluble C-terminal ACE2 fragment from cell membranes.
Endogenous ACE2 cleavage is regulated by γS
293T and MEFs do not express significant levels of endogenous ACE2. To confirm the physiologic
relevance of γS-mediated ACE2 cleavage, we used two well-characterized ACE2-positive cell lines that
allow SARS-CoV-2 infection and replication, Caco-2 and VeroE6. Using an antibody that recognizes the
C-terminal region of ACE2, we observed accumulation of endogenous ACE2ΔE with GSI treatment in
both cell lines (Fig. 3A-C). These data confirmed results from ectopic ACE2 expression. We next took
advantage of this system to test whether longer ACE2ΔE half-life or impaired production of ACE2-ICD
may produce negative feedback on this pathway in these cells. This hypothesis was based on nuclear
localization and transcriptional activity of the C-terminal fragment of the related protein, ACE (27, 28).

However, we did not observe nuclear ACE2 or differences in expression of ACE2, TMPRSS2 or ADAM17
in DBZ-treated VeroE6 or Caco-2 cells (Fig. 3D-F). These data render unlikely the possibility that ACE2ICD mediates feedback inhibition on ACE2 gene expression.
γS inhibition does not alter SARS-CoV-2 S-protein-mediated cell entry
As genetic or pharmacologic γS inhibition affected ACE2 cleavage and subcellular localization, we
hypothesized that GSI may reduce SARS-CoV-2 cell entry and replication. To test this potential, we
utilized SARS-CoV-2 S-protein pseudotyped with VSV and tested a wide range of DBZ concentrations
(0.3 nM-1 µM). In comparison to a potent S-protein neutralizing antibody, used as a positive control (24),
DBZ did not affect SARS-CoV-2 S-protein mediated viral entry in VeroE6 or in Caco-2 cells (Fig. 4).
These results indicate that although γS is necessary for ACE2 intracellular processing, blocking γS does
not affect viral entry.

Discussion
ACE2 has recently caught the attention of the research community because of its role as the functional
receptor of SARS-CoV-2 (3). Here we have characterized ACE2 as a novel target of γS (Fig. 5). Similar
to other known targets (16-18), ectodomain shedding prompts γS-mediated intramembrane cleavage to
release soluble ACE2-ICD. Some ICDs (i.e. Notch) generated by γS are transcriptionally active, but a
functional role of many others remains elusive (16). γS has also been dubbed as the “proteasome of the
membrane” (29). Our finding that ACE2-ICD is rapidly cleared by proteasomal degradation suggests is
consistent with the view that γS-mediated cleavage represents a way to dispose membrane proteins stubs.
However, our data cannot as yet discard the hypothesis that ACE2-ICD might represent a novel
biologically active peptide.
Previous reports indicate that ACE2 processing by cell membrane proteases such as ADAM17 or
TMPRSS2 impacts SARS-CoV S-protein mediated cell entry (5, 7). Our data is clear that pharmacologic
inhibition of γS-mediated ACE2 cleavage does not, but cannot rule out the possibility that other
compounds termed “γS modulators” (GSMs) (30) may behave differently. GSMs, developed primarily to
differentially affect γS processing of so-called “on-target” (i.e. APP) as opposed to “off-target” (i.e.
Notch) substrates, may in fact selectively increase γS processivity. In light of our finding that ACE2 is a
novel γS target, GSMs are worth evaluating for biological activity against SARS-CoV-2 pathogenesis. In
addition, some groups have speculated that blocking Notch signaling with GSIs may ameliorate COVID19 progression (31). Notch signaling promotes M1 polarization of macrophages (32), and also contributes
to T-cell cytokine production (33). Thus, despite our finding that GSI does not directly affect viral entry,
potential effects to block Notch-induced hyperinflammation suggest compounds that have completed
Ph2/3 clinical trials can potentially be repurposed for COVID-19.
In addition to the relatively recently discovered role as a viral receptor, ACE2 has known roles in
the renin-angiotensin system (34), but also other potential functions. For example, mutations causal of
Hartnup disorder impair association of the neutral amino acid transporter SLC6A19 with ACE2,
suggesting that ACE2 serves as a chaperone for membrane trafficking (35), akin to the function of
collectrin towards SLC6A19 or SLC1A1 (36). It is possible that γS-mediated transmembrane processing
of ACE2 may impact ACE2 chaperone ability, or even in the structurally homologous collectrin. These
potential ramifications of our findings require further study.
In sum, our results demonstrate that ACE2 is a novel γS target, but that pharmacologic inhibition
of γS does not impact SARS-CoV-2 S-protein mediated cell entry. Given the pharmacologic accessibility
of γS, with prior evaluation of GSIs and GSMs for Alzheimer’s Disease and cancer, we present these data
to encourage further exploration into this novel biology for application to COVID-19 or to other
pathology attributable to the myriad functions ascribed to ACE2.
