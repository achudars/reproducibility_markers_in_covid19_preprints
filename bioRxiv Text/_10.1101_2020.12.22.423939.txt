Abstract

18

While MERS-CoV (Middle East respiratory syndrome Coronavirus) provokes a lethal

19

disease in humans, camelids, the main virus reservoir, are asymptomatic carriers,

20

suggesting a crucial role for innate immune responses in controlling the infection.

21

Experimentally infected camelids clear infectious virus within one week and mount an

22

effective adaptive immune response. Here, transcription of immune response genes was

23

monitored in the respiratory tract of MERS-CoV infected alpacas. Concomitant to the

25

(IFNs) were maximally transcribed only in the nasal mucosa of alpacas, provoking the

26

induction of interferon stimulated genes (ISGs) along the whole respiratory tract.

27

Simultaneous to mild focal infiltration of leukocytes in nasal mucosa and submucosa,

28

upregulation of the anti-inflammatory cytokine IL10 and dampened transcription of pro-

29

inflammatory genes under NF-κB control were observed. In the lung, early (1 dpi)

30

transcription of chemokines (CCL2 and CCL3) correlated with a transient accumulation

31

of mainly mononuclear leukocytes. A tight regulation of IFNs in lungs with expression

32

of ISGs and controlled inflammatory responses, might contribute to virus clearance

33

without causing tissue damage. Thus, the nasal mucosa, the main target of MERS-CoV

34

in camelids, is central in driving an efficient innate immune response based on triggering

35

ISGs as well as the dual anti-inflammatory effects of type III IFNs and IL10.

Author summary

37

Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) is the etiological agent of a

38

respiratory disease causing high mortality in humans. In camelids, the main MERS-CoV

39

reservoir host, viral infection leads to subclinical disease. Our study describes

40

transcriptional regulations of innate immunological pathways underlying asymptomatic

41

clinical manifestations of alpacas in response to MERS-CoV. Concomitant to the peak of

42

infection, these animals elicited a strong transient interferon response and induction of

43

the anti-inflammatory cytokine IL10 in the nasal mucosa. This was associated to a

44

dimmed regulation of pro-inflammatory cytokines and induction of interferon stimulated

45

genes along the whole respiratory mucosa, leading to the rapid clearance of the virus.

46

Thus, innate immune responses occurring in the nasal mucosa appear to be the key in

47

controlling MERS-CoV disease by avoiding a cytokine storm. Understanding on how

48

asymptomatic host reservoirs counteract MERS-CoV infection will aid in the

Introduction

51

The Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS) is a disease caused by a zoonotic

52

Coronavirus (MERS-CoV) that emerged in 2012 in the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia [1]

53

raising a toll of 2,562 confirmed human cases in 27 countries, with 881 deaths until the

54

November 2020 [2]. In humans, MERS-CoV infection ranges from asymptomatic to

55

severe or even fatal respiratory disease [3]. Dromedary camels are the main viral reservoir

56

[4], and all camelids are susceptible to the virus, under both natural and experimental

57

conditions [5–10]. However, despite consequent tissue viral loads and high viral shedding

58

at the upper respiratory tract (URT) level, infection in camelids is asymptomatic, leading

59

to a rapid clearance of the virus [5,9,11] and the establishment of a solid acquired

60

immunity. Indeed, field studies revealed a high proportion of serum neutralizing

61

antibodies in dromedary camels [8,12]. Innate immune responses are essential as they

62

link adaptive immunity [13] and are key players in the pathology of diseases [14].

63

Nevertheless, the severity of MERS lesions in humans has been attributed to aberrant

64

innate and adaptive immune responses based essentially on data obtained from

65

macrophages isolated from healthy donors or infected patients, as well as dosage of

66

cytokines/chemokines from bronchoalveolar lavages. The outcome of these studies

67

reveals an overproduction of proinflammatory cytokines/chemokines due to the

68

activation of C-type lectin receptors, RIG-I like receptors (RLRs) and an impaired

69

production of type I interferons (IFN) [15–18]. High production and persistent high levels

70

of these cytokines in macrophages are likely to exacerbate disease severity. Despite that

71

macrophages can be infected, at least in vitro, MERS-CoV has a preferable tropism for

72

respiratory epithelial cells [18]. To date, no data is available on innate immune responses

73

affecting the human respiratory mucosa in vivo and most information was mainly

74

obtained from ex vivo pseudostratified primary bronchial airway epithelial cells [18,19],

75

immortalized epithelial cells [19,20] or respiratory explants [21–23]. Although some

76

contradictory results have been reported, MERS-CoV infections in these cells or tissues

77

led to the conclusion that type I and III IFN are inhibited [24,25] or, when delayed [26],

78

weakly expressed [27]. Nonetheless, some MERS-CoV African strains isolated from

79

dromedary camels, as opposed to the Arabian human isolated EMC/2012 strain, can

80

induce higher levels of IFN, IFN1, IFN stimulated genes (ISGs) and proinflammatory

81

cytokines mRNA in Calu-3 cells after 48 h of infection [22]. Indeed, the prototypic strain

82

EMC/2012 and MERS-CoV African strains belong to different clades (A and C

83

respectively) displaying deletions particularly in the ORF4b [22]. In that respect, several

84

viral factors, including MERS-CoV accessory proteins 4a and 4b, have been shown in

85

respiratory epithelial cell lines to antagonize the production of IFNs, to interfere with the

86

NF-B signaling pathway by avoiding production of proinflammatory cytokines [28] and

87

inhibiting the protein kinase R-mediated stress response [29]. In addition, in epithelial

88

cell lines, the structural viral protein N interacts with the host E3 ligase tripartite motif

89

protein 25 (TRIM25) impeding ubiquitination of RIG-I and further expression of type I

90

interferons and IFN-1 [30]. Therefore, in contrast to the cytokine storm provoked by

91

macrophages, epithelial innate immune responses seem to be profoundly paralyzed. This

92

is of major consequence for the progression of the disease, since the respiratory mucosa

93

is the primary barrier for MERS-CoV. Recent findings indicate that type III IFNs confer

94

initial protection, restricting tissue damage at the mucosa level by limiting inflammatory

95

responses and potentiating adaptive immunity. Furthermore, it is postulated that when the

96

viral burden is high and the mucosal fitness is broken, type I IFNs take over, leading to

97

enhanced immune responses provoking also uncontrolled pro-inflammatory responses

98

[31].

99

Owing that bats, the primary reservoir for coronaviruses, are tolerant to MERS-CoV (and

100

other viruses) due to a dampened Nod-like receptor family pyrin domain-containing 3

101

(NLRP3) inflammasome [32], it was of major interest to gain insights into innate immune

102

responses induced by MERS-CoV in camelids. Therefore, by understanding how

103

reservoir/intermediary hosts control MERS-CoV and by extension other coronaviruses, a

104

wealth of information could be translated to other species experimenting severe disease

105

for the improvement of prevention, treatments and vaccines.

106

In the present study, alpacas were experimentally infected and monitored at the

107

transcriptional level for a set of innate immune response genes along the upper and lower

108

respiratory tract (LRT) during four consecutive days. Special attention was given to the

109

nasal epithelium as it is the primary site of MERS-CoV replication. Regulation of IFNs,

110

pattern recognition receptors (PRRs), IFN regulatory transcription factors (IRFs) and

111

enzymes constituting the NLRP3 inflammasome or the NF-κB pathway was analyzed

112

providing insights on signaling mechanisms important for MERS-CoV replication and

113

disease progression, elucidating key regulatory host factors to counteract MERS-CoV

114

infection.

116

Clinical signs of alpacas following MERS-CoV infection

117

The objective of this study was to evaluate early innate immune responses upon MERS-

118

CoV infection in camelids. The MERS-CoV Qatar15/2015 strain was selected because

119

clade B strains are nowadays exclusively circulating in the Arabian Peninsula [4,33].

120

Three alpacas (AP13-AP15) were euthanized before virus inoculation and served as

121

controls, while groups of three animals (AP1-AP3, AP4-AP6, AP7-AP9, AP10-AP12)

122

were sacrificed sequentially during four consecutive days after MERS-CoV inoculation.

123

nasal swabs (NS) and respiratory tissue samples were collected at the day of euthanasia.

124

Following virus inoculation, only one alpaca (AP6) secreted a mild amount of nasal

125

mucus on 2 days post inoculation (dpi). None of the remaining animals showed clinical

126

signs and basal body temperatures remained constant (below 39.5ºC) throughout the

127

study.

128

Nasal viral shedding and MERS-CoV loads in respiratory tracts during infection in

129

alpacas

130

On the day of euthanasia (0, 1, 2, 3, and 4 dpi), NS were collected. Viral detection and

131

loads were assessed by RT-qPCR. All MERS-CoV inoculated alpacas (AP1-AP12) shed

132

viral RNA, but no major differences were detected between the different time points. Also,

133

viral titration in NS showed that all inoculated animals excreted infectious MERS-CoV.

134

Maximal viral loads in the nasal cavity were reached at 2 dpi. Of note, animal AP6 shed

135

the highest loads of infectious virus (4.8 TCID50/ml). None of the alpacas, including

136

negative controls (AP13-AP15), had viral RNA or infectious virus on 0 dpi (Fig 1A).

137

MERS-CoV RNA was detected in all homogenized respiratory tissues during infection.

138

The higher viral loads were found on 2 dpi in nasal turbinates and bronchus with a

139

significant increase compared to those detected on 1 dpi. Trachea and lung displayed the

140

lowest viral RNA loads. In all cases, at 4 dpi, infectious virus was still excreted, and viral

141

RNA was present in the respiratory tract (Fig 1B).

MERS-CoV establishes early infections in URTs and LRTs of alpacas

143

Histopathology of URTs and LRTs was assessed in a blinded manner independently by

144

veterinary pathologists. On 2 and 3 dpi, histological lesions in MERS-CoV infected

145

alpacas were limited to the respiratory tract, being of multifocal distribution and mild.

146

Lesions in nasal turbinates were characterized by mild rhinitis, segmental hyperplasia of

147

the nasal epithelium, lymphocytic exocytosis, loss of epithelial polarity and tight junction

148

integrity. Additionally, small numbers of lymphocytes with fewer macrophages

149

infiltrated the underlying submucosa. No microscopic lesions were observed in nasal

150

turbinates on 0, 1 and 4 dpi in any of the animals, which displayed a multifocal

151

localization of the MERS-CoV antigen detected by immunohistochemistry (IHC). While

152

only a few pseudostratified columnar epithelial cells in the nose contained MERS-CoV

153

antigen on 1 dpi, the number of positive epithelial cells was remarkably high on 2 dpi;

154

such number steadily decreased in the alpacas necropsied on the following days. On 4

155

dpi, the MERS-CoV antigen was scarcely detected with no evidence of microscopic

156

lesions (Fig 2A).

157

Trachea and bronchus showed multifocal, mild tracheitis/bronchitis, with the presence of

158

few lymphocytes in the epithelium and mild infiltration of the submucosa by lymphocytes

159

and macrophages on 2 dpi. In line with these observations, MERS-CoV infected cells

160

were rarely detected within the epithelium on 2 dpi by IHC, mostly in areas displaying

161

these minimal lesions (Fig 2B). Remarkably, the trachea of AP6 harbored the highest

162

viral load as detected by IHC. Few labeled cells were observed on 4 dpi (S1 Table) with

163

no evidence of lesions. Additionally, lung lobes showed mild multifocal perivascular and

164

peribronchiolar infiltration by lymphocytes and the presence of monocyte/macrophages

165

within the alveoli, being more evident on 2dpi. MERS-CoV antigen was occasionally

166

observed in bronchiolar epithelial cells on 2 dpi (Fig 2B), and rarely on 4 dpi (S1 Table).

167

Of note, pneumocytes were not labeled by MERS-CoV IHC (Fig 2B).

168

Viral loads in micro-dissected nasal tissues and whole tracheal and lung sections

169

Viral loads and viral transcription/replication were also assessed on methacarn-fixed

170

paraffin-embedded (MFPE) tissue sections which were further used for cytokine

171

quantification. Special attention was given to the nasal epithelium as it is the privileged

172

tissue for viral replication. Thus, laser capture microdissection (LCM) was used to obtain,

173

when possible and for each animal, nasal epithelial areas positive or negative for MERS-

174

CoV, as assessed by IHC, in different but consecutive (parallel) MFPE tissue sections.

175

Their respective underlying submucosa were also collected at 1 and 3 dpi (S1 Fig).

176

Moreover, MFPE sections of tracheas and lungs were directly scrapped from the slide.

177

On 1 dpi only a few isolated nasal epithelial cells were IHC positive. These were micro-

178

dissected, as described above, with the surrounding IHC negative cells to get enough

179

RNA for the microfluidic PCR quantitative assay. To the contrary, due to the massive

180

infection in nasal tissues at 2 dpi, only IHC negative nasal epithelial areas from AP4 could

181

be collected. Viral loads in micro-dissected nasal tissues and MFPE tracheal and lung

182

scrapped samples were quantified with UpE primers using the microfluidic quantitative

183

PCR assay. As illustrated in A in S2 Fig, micro-dissected MERS-CoV infected epithelial

184

areas, as assessed by their parallel IHC stained sections, showed higher viral loads than

185

non-labelled epithelial areas, confirming the validity of the technique. In agreement with

186

immunohistochemical observations, MERS-CoV RNA was of lower abundance in

187

submucosal layers. As expected, and according to results obtained with tissue macerates

188

(Fig 1B), microfluidic quantification of MERS-CoV viral RNA revealed a much lower

189

degree of virus replication in trachea and lung than in nasal tissues. These results were

190

confirmed with the M mRNA microfluidic PCR (B in S2 Fig and A in S3 Table) and, as

191

expected, showed a greater extension of MERS-CoV infection in tissues, in particular in

192

the nasal epithelia, than that revealed by IHC.

195

In order to investigate the antiviral pathways induced upon MERS-CoV infection, relative

196

mRNA expression levels for 37 innate immune response genes were assessed along the

197

respiratory tract with the same cDNA samples as those used for viral UpE and M mRNA

quantifications in a Fluidigm BioMark microfluidic assay. In all nasal mucosa of non-

199

infected animals, IFNβ mRNA was undetectable and comparisons for this gene were

200

performed against levels of expression found in animals infected on 1 dpi. For IFNλ3

201

very low basal levels, at the limit of detection (Cq=25), were found in 2 out of 3 animals

202

on 0 dpi. All other gene transcripts were detected at basal levels in control non-infected

203

animals and were used as calibrator values (B in S3 Table).

204

At the level of MERS-CoV infected nasal epithelia (positively stained by IHC), most of

205

the transcription variations occurred and peaked at 2 dpi. Genes coding for IFNβ (mean

206

of 200 Fc) and IFNλ3 (mean of 350 Fc), and to a lesser extent IFNα (mean of 6 Fc) and

207

IFNλ1 (mean of 11 Fc) were significantly upregulated. Relative expression of type I IFNs

208

(α and β) and type III IFNs (λ1 and λ3) decreased progressively on 3 and 4 dpi (Fig 3A

209

and B).

210

The same patterns of gene transcription were observed for ISGs with antiviral activity

211

(ISG15, MX1, CXCL10 and OAS1), IRF7, cytoplasmic viral RNA sensors (RIG1 and

212

MDA5) and, although moderately upregulated, the endosome viral double and single

213

stranded RNA sensors (TLR3 and TLR7 respectively) and the transcription factor STAT1.

214

The E3 ubiquitin ligase TRIM25, an important enzyme that plays a key role in RIG1

215

ubiquitination, was upregulated on 2 dpi (mean of 4.5 Fc) and decreased afterward (Fig

216

3A and B, and C in S3 Table).

217

The pro-inflammatory antagonist IL10 was upregulated at 2 dpi (mean of 10 Fc) and

218

returned to nearly steady state levels in the following days (Fig 3A and B). Only three

219

genes involved in inflammation, TNF, IL6 and IRF5 (mean of 2.5-3 Fc for each of them),

220

were found slightly upregulated at 2 dpi, while the levels of expression of other critical

221

pro-inflammatory factors, such as the cytokines IL8, IL1β, the adaptor PYCARD and the

222

PRRs NLRP3, were marginally or not affected by the infection (Fig 3A, A in S3 Fig and

223

C in S3 Table). Although not statistically significant, CASP1, an essential component of

224

the inflammasome (as PYCARD and NLRP3), experienced moderate mRNA increases

225

(2 to 8 Fc following the animals) at 2 and 3 dpi (A in S3 Fig). Finally, the chemo-attractant

226

chemokines CCL2 and CCL3 were non-significantly upregulated (mean of 5 Fc) as

227

shown in A in S3 Fig.

228

Nasal epithelium negative by IHC for MERS-CoV exhibited a moderate but non-

229

significant increase for type I and III IFNs mRNA on 2, 3 and 4 dpi. However, ISG15,

230

MX1, RIG1, MDA5, TLR3, IRF7, IL10 and TRIM25 genes were upregulated at 3 dpi

231

but to a lower degree than in positive IHC epithelial areas (Fig 3A and B). Invariably, all

232

the above-mentioned genes had a significant decreased expression from 2 dpi onwards.

233

Transcription of most of the inflammatory cytokines was not affected or slightly

234

downregulated upon infection (Fig 3A, A in S3 Fig and C in S3 Table).

235

As shown in S4 Fig, increased induction of type I IFNs in nasal epithelial micro-dissected

236

samples was weakly correlated to increased viral MERS-CoV loads and transcription

237

levels of IL10. In contrast, upregulation of type III IFNs had a stronger correlation with

238

higher viral loads, as assessed by microfluidic PCR quantification of the viral M mRNA

239

(r = 0.64, P = 0.004 for IFNλ1 and r = 0.64, P = 0.0163 for IFNλ3), the UpE gene (r =

240

0.65, P = 0.0033 for IFNλ1 and r = 0.64, P = 0.0163 for IFNλ3) and increased relative

241

mRNA levels of IL10 (r = 0.9, P <0.0001 for IFNλ1 and r = 0.8, P = 0.0009 for IFNλ3).

242

Our data indicate that antiviral mechanisms are set during the peak of infection in the

243

nasal epithelia with a timely induction of type I and III IFNs, ISGs and IL10 without

244

exacerbation of pro-inflammatory cytokines.

245

ISGs and PRRs but not IFNs are upregulated in the nasal submucosa of infected

246

alpacas: evidence for a potential IFN paracrine signaling

247

To further investigate the repercussion of MERS-CoV infection in the mucosa, innate

248

immune responses occurring in the underlying submucosa were determined. Micro-

249

dissected areas from the submucosa of control and infected animals (1 and 3 dpi) were

250

analyzed for relative mRNA expression of innate immune genes. Except for IFNλ3 which

251

was not detected in any inoculated or control animals, all other IFNs were expressed at

252

basal levels in control non-infected alpacas. IFNβ was undetected at 1 dpi in two

253

inoculated animals (AP2 and AP3) and below basal levels in alpaca AP1 while IFN and

254

IFN1 were marginally fluctuating. Most of the major transcriptional modifications

255

occurred at 3 dpi. In submucosa underlying the most infected epithelia areas, IFNλ1 was

256

expressed at basal levels while IFNα and IFNβ were not induced. On the contrary, ISGs,

257

IRFs and PRRs, like ISG15 (mean of 77 Fc), OAS1 (mean of 6 Fc), MX1 (mean of 46

258

Fc), CXCL10 (mean of 14 Fc), RIG1 (mean of 12 Fc), MDA5 (mean of 16 Fc), IRF7

259

(mean of 9 Fc) and TLR7 (mean of 5 Fc) were highly to moderately upregulated.

260

Expression of genes constituting the inflammasome was mostly not altered for NLRP3 or

261

moderately increased for CASP1 (mean of 5 Fc) and PYCARD (mean of 3 Fc); but

262

remarkably, IL1β was significantly downregulated (mean of 3 Fc; Fig 4A and B). Also,

263

except for a non-significant increase of TNFα (mean of 5 Fc) and a slight upregulation of

264

IRF5 (mean of 3 Fc; P < 0.05), no other pro-inflammatory factors were upregulated.

265

Indeed, IL8 was downregulated (mean of -40 Fc). According to these findings, the anti-

266

inflammatory cytokine IL10 (mean of 3.5 Fc) was moderately upregulated (Fig 4A, B

and D in S3 Table). Furthermore, the submucosa underlying epithelial cells with no

268

MERS-CoV IHC labelling showed the same patterns of cytokine profiles as for that

269

underlying heavily MERS-CoV infected mucosa but to a lesser degree of expression (Fig

270

4A and B). Overall, results obtained in the submucosa are indicative of a potential IFN

271

paracrine signaling from the epithelium for the occurrence of ISGs induction in the

272

absence of significant IFN mRNA synthesis. Moreover, despite mild focal infiltrations

(Fig 2), genes involved in the inflammatory process were either suppressed, unaltered or

274

mildly activated.

275

ISGs are upregulated in the trachea of infected alpacas without increased

276

endogenous IFNs mRNA

277

Innate immune response genes were further monitored along the URT. In trachea, IFNβ

278

and IFNλ3 mRNA transcripts were not detected at any time post-inoculation including

279

on 0 dpi. From 1 to 4 dpi, expression of IFNα and λ1 was slightly downregulated or

280

unaltered, compared to basal levels found in non-infected controls (Fig 5A and E in S3

281

Table). Genes coding for ISGs (ISG15, MX1 and OAS1) and PRRs (RIG1, MDA5 and

282

TLR3) showed a significant mRNA upregulation mainly at 2 and 3 dpi. When compared

283

with animals necropsied at 1 dpi, IRF7 was significantly upregulated (mean of 9 Fc) at 2

284

dpi (Fig 5A and B). The expression of IL10 was not significantly altered (Fig 5A and B

285

in S3 Fig). The induction of proinflammatory cytokine genes was inhibited or remained

286

unchanged at all post-inoculation points (Fig 5A, B and B in S3 Fig), except for AP6.

287

This animal unlike other alpacas sacrificed at 2 dpi experienced an upregulation of

288

proinflammatory cytokines and the inflammasome in the trachea. However, IL6 and

289

PYCARD mRNA levels were almost unaltered (Fig 5A, B in S3 Fig and E in S3 Table).

290

Excluding OAS1, AP6 was the animal with the highest expression levels of ISGs, RNA

291

sensors, transcriptional factors and chemokines as shown in Fig 5A, B, D, B in S3 Fig

292

and E in S3 Table. In that respect, AP6 could be considered as an out layer since, unlike

293

other animals, it presented nasal discharges with the highest number of infected cells in

294

nose and trachea and the highest viral loads in trachea (S1 Table and A in S3 Table).

295

Moreover, when compared to AP4 and AP5, which displayed nearly basal levels of CCL2

296

and CCL3 transcripts (Fig 5C, A in S5 Fig and E in S3 Table), the tracheal submucosa of

297

AP6 was moderately infiltrated by macrophages and lymphocytes (Fig 5D). This also

298

provides indirect proof that the chemokines CCL2 and CCL3 were produced at the protein

299

level and exerted chemoattraction.

300

Early induction of CCL2 and CCL3 correlates with infiltration of macrophages and

301

lymphocyte like cells in the lungs of infected alpacas

302

Despite low infectivity of MERS-CoV in the LRT, infiltration of leukocytes was observed

303

suggesting that cytokines and chemokines are at play. At the lung level, IFNα and IFNλ1

304

were expressed on 0 dpi in non-infected controls. In response to MERS-CoV, transcripts

305

of IFNα and IFNλ1 fluctuated around basal levels (Fig 6A and F in S3 Table). IFNλ3 and

306

IFNβ mRNAs were not detected in any of the animals including controls. Upregulation

307

of ISGs (ISG15, MX1 and OAS1) and IRF7 started at 1 dpi, reached a peak at 2 dpi and

308

weaned at 4 dpi. RIG1 and MDA5 were unevenly upregulated with a lower intensity than

309

for other tissues (C in S3 Fig and F in S3 Table). Remarkably, NLRP3 was moderately

310

but significantly upregulated at 1, 2 and 4 dpi concomitant with increased levels of TNFα

311

and IL1β at 1 dpi (Fig 6A and B). However, transcription of CASP1 remained unaltered

312

and the PYCARD gene was downregulated at 1, 2 and 4 dpi or unaltered at 3 dpi (C in

313

S3 Fig and F in S3 Table). IL15, a natural killer cell activator cytokine, was significantly

314

upregulated at 1 and 2 dpi while expression patterns of other proinflammatory cytokines

315

varied between animals and days of infection (Fig 6A and B, C in S3 Fig and F in S3

316

Table).

317

In addition, CCL2 and CCL3 were moderately to highly upregulated at most of the time

318

points (Fig 7A, C in S3 Fig and B in S5 Fig). All animals showed very mild infiltration

319

of leukocytes in the alveoli in response to MERS-CoV (Fig 7B and C in S5 Fig).

320

Remarkably, AP6 showed accumulation of leukocytes without a notable induction of

321

CCL2 and CCL3 mRNAs. Moreover, this animal was the highest producer of these

322

chemoattractant chemokines in trachea. Nonetheless, the number of infiltrating

323

leukocytes correlated with the induction of CCL2 (r = 0.62, P = 0.0236) and CCL3 (r =

324

0.59, P = 0.0323) as shown in D and E in S5 Fig. When considering AP6 as an out layer,

325

correlations became stronger for both CCL2 (r = 0.72, P = 0.0077) and CCL3 (r = 0.87,

326

P = 0.0002) as shown in Fig 7A. Overall, ISGs were induced in the absence of IFN gene

327

expression suggesting an endocrine effect of IFNs produced in the nasal epithelia. In

328

addition, despite transient accumulation of leukocytes correlating with induction of CCL2

329

and CCL3 in the lung, exacerbation of inflammatory responses did not occur.

330

Genes of the NF- κ B pathway and IRF5 are transcriptionally unaltered in

331

respiratory tissues during MERS-CoV infection

332

Transcription of the NF-κB p50 subunit (NFKB1) and some important regulators of the

333

NF-κB pathway were checked along URTs and LRTs. These regulators included two

334

enzymes, AZI2 and TBK1, downstream of the RLRs and TLR signaling pathways,

335

essential for the phosphorylation of NF-κB, the NF-κB inhibitor NFKBIA and an adaptor

336

CARD9 that mediates signals from C-type lectins to regulate the NF-κB pathway (S6 Fig).

337

All these genes were expressed at basal levels in the nasal mucosa, submucosa, trachea

338

and lung of control non-infected alpacas. NFKB1, AZI2 and TBK1 were only marginally

339

induced or remained unaltered in the nasal epithelia; however, NFKBIA and CARD9

340

were expressed at basal levels or even slightly downregulated in all the tissues. All the

341

above mentioned genes were fluctuating around basal transcriptional levels across alpaca

342

respiratory tracts (Fig 3A-6A and C-F in S3 Table) indicating that the NF-κB mediated

343

signaling pathway was not exacerbated or downregulated in response to MERS-CoV.

344

Moreover, IRF5, an inducer of TNF and IL6 as well as an important factor for the

345

polarization of M1 macrophages, was only slightly but significantly upregulated in the

346

nasal epithelium (2 dpi) and submucosa (3 dpi). In all other tissues and, in particular lung,

the majority of animals did not reach the threshold of 2 Fc for IRF5 (C in S3 Fig and F in

Discussion

350

The present study exposes an integrated investigation at the respiratory tract level

351

performed in vivo in a natural reservoir/intermediate host upon MERS-CoV infection. As

352

camelids are the primary zoonotic reservoirs for human infection, it is essential to gain

353

insight into the potential mechanisms of asymptomatic manifestation since they can

354

unravel targets for prophylactic treatments in susceptible hosts. In the present study, all

355

experimentally inoculated alpacas were successfully infected, as genomic viral UpE,

356

subgenomic M mRNA and the N protein could be detected in most of the tissues

357

examined by IHC, RT-qPCR or micro fluidic PCR assays from the URT and LRT at 1 to

358

4 dpi. This proved that the MERS-CoV Qatar15/2015 strain had spread and in some

359

instance replicated throughout the whole respiratory tracts, although mainly at the URT

360

where the virus receptor DPP4 (dipeptidyl peptidase-4) is most abundant [34].

361

Acknowledging that respiratory mucosal epithelial cells are the main primary target for

362

MERS-CoV and the paucity of data on the effect in vivo of the virus to the mucosal barrier

363

on humans and other laboratory species (mainly human DPP4 transgenic or transduced

364

mice and non-human primates) a special attention was given here to monitor innate

365

immune responses occurring during the first 4 days of infection in the nasal epithelium

366

of alpacas and the possible repercussions of these responses in the respiratory tract.

367

In mucosa, pathogens are sensed by PRRs leading to the production of type I and III IFNs

368

via IRFs. In turn, IFNs can activate through the JAK-STAT pathway, in an autocrine,

369

paracrine or endocrine manner, transcription of various antiviral and regulatory ISGs

370

including also PRRs and IRFs. Fine tuning of these responses is paramount in determining

371

the outcome of viral infectious diseases [31]. In MERS-CoV infected alpacas, during the

15

bioRxiv preprint doi: https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.12.22.423939; this version posted December 22, 2020. The copyright holder for this

372

first 24h, apart from IFNβ which started to be induced, type I and III IFNs were not altered

373

in the nasal mucosa when compared to control animals. This short period seems to be

374

crucial for the virus to establish a productive infection in alpacas for at least 5 to 6 days

375

[5] by delaying host protective mechanisms such as activation of PRR pathways

376

[17,30,35]. Nonetheless, and only in the nasal epithelium, transcription of all type I and

377

III IFNs peaked simultaneously at 2 dpi and weaned progressively. This wave of IFNs

378

was concomitant with the induction of ISGs, PRRs and IRF7 not only at the nasal

379

epithelial barrier and its underlying submucosa but also in trachea and lungs where IFN

380

mRNAs were never detected or induced. Therefore, the effect of the IFN response at the

381

nasal mucosa may extend to distant respiratory tissues in a paracrine or endocrine manner.

382

In that respect, in mice, IFN produced in the URT prevents dissemination of influenza

383

virus to the lung [36].

384

The use of IHC and microfluidic PCR assays combined with LCM permitted to compare,

385

in the same and different animals, areas of the nasal epithelium with high and low viral

386

loads. Heavily infected mucosal areas were responsible for the highest induction of type

387

III IFNs. Although markedly induced, type I IFNs did not significantly correlated with

388

tissue viral loads. Consistent with this IFN production, the number of MERS-CoV

389

infected cells detected by IHC was maximal on 2 dpi and decreased over time. However,

390

all infected alpacas shed infectious viral particles in the nasal cavity from 1 dpi onwards

391

according to previous studies [5,6]. This might be due to a high accumulation of virus in

392

the nasal cavity which may take a few days to clear. Remarkably, results obtained herein

393

contrast with those found in human epithelial cells and respiratory explants since the

394

induction of type I and III IFNs was limited or inhibited in response to MERS-CoV

395

[19,20,23]. The dampened IFN priming in humans is likely due to the role of IFN

396

antagonism by MERS-CoV accessory proteins [20,24,29,37], through which virus

16

397

replication is facilitated. It is important to note that the MERS-CoV strain (Qatar15/2015)

398

used herein is from human origin and, unlike some dromedary isolated African strains, it

399

does not display any deletions in the above-mentioned non-structural proteins [22].

400

Therefore, alpacas are able to overcome IFN inhibitory mechanisms in a relative short

401

time with the induction of antiviral or IFN positive regulatory ISGs. Nonetheless, the

402

prominent manifestation of MERS in humans occurs in lungs with a massive

403

inflammation provoked by infiltration of macrophages and lymphocytes [38]. To the

404

contrary, and although AP6 experienced discrete nasal discharges and displayed large

405

numbers of infected nasal epithelial cells, alpacas only exhibited transient mild and focal

406

infiltration of lymphocytes, macrophages and neutrophils in response to MERS-CoV.

407

Such infiltrations were mainly observed on 2 dpi and gradually resolved afterwards.

408

These findings suggested a rapid fine tuning of specific mechanisms to control

409

inflammation mediated essentially by the mucosal barrier, leading to an efficient innate

410

immune response. Indeed, type III IFNs are known to induce milder inflammatory

411

responses than IFN [31] and IL10 is an anti-inflammatory cytokine [39]. Furthermore,

412

recent studies in mice indicate intricate mechanisms between IFN and IL10 via dendritic

413

cells (DC) conditioning protective mucosal immunity against influenza virus [40]. In this

414

view, it is noteworthy to mention that plasmacytoid DC are seemingly the only cell-type

415

that produce in vitro type I and III IFNs after MERS-CoV infection in humans [41]. By

416

contrast, in vivo, pDCs which predominantly localize in the submucosa are not the main

417

IFN producers [42,43]. Due to the lack of specific cell markers for DC in alpacas,

418

detection of these cells in tissues and their contribution to innate immunity could not be

419

performed. Nonetheless, a strong positive correlation between IFNλ1,3 and IL10 mRNA

420

levels was observed in the nasal epithelium of alpacas and this could reflect a

421

physiological cross-regulation between these structurally related cytokines upon MERS-

17

422

CoV infection. By contrast, the weak correlation between IFNβ and IL10 mRNA

423

induction suggests that only type III IFNs are directly or indirectly mediating anti-

424

inflammatory action. Furthermore, IL10 was significantly up regulated, although at

425

moderate levels, in the nasal submucosa underlying heavily infected epithelial cells.

426

Moreover, IRF5 known to be a pro-inflammatory transcription factor and a key element

427

in the M1 polarization of macrophages [44,45] was only slightly induced in the nasal

428

mucosa and submucosa on 2 and 3 dpi. However, no IRF5 mRNA increased in the lung

429

despite infiltration of mainly macrophages and lymphocytes as early as 1 dpi.

430

Accordingly, CCL2, CCL3, CXCL10 and TNFα were induced in the lung in the absence

431

of type I IFNs, as found for MERS-CoV infected human monocyte-derived macrophages

432

[16]. With the observation that other pro-inflammatory cytokines are either weakly or not

433

induced, it is suspected that inflammatory M1 macrophages are not abundant in the lung

434

of infected alpacas. Also, IL15, an activator and attractor of NK cells and macrophages

435

[46], was only induced in lung as soon as 1 dpi, suggesting a role for clearance of the

436

virus by these cells. Strikingly, NLRP3 mRNA was more abundant in the lung (with the

437

exception of AP6 in trachea), maybe due to the presence of infiltrating macrophages

438

where NLRP3 is mostly produced [47,48]. However, CASP1 and PYCARD, the two

439

other components of inflammasome, were not induced. This scenario, combined with a

440

discrete upregulation of IL1β and IL6 in some animals, will not probably result in a

441

cytokine storm in the lung. Accordingly, in other respiratory tissues, the major

442

proinflammatory cytokines were occasionally mildly induced, suggesting also a

443

functional but attenuated NF-κB signaling [49]. Moreover, during infection, genes

444

involved in the regulation of the NF-κB cascade (AZI2, TBK1 and NFKBIA) and

445

NFKB1were transcriptionally unaltered in all the respiratory tract of alpacas preventing

446

acute inflammation in response to MERS-CoV.

447

In a mice model of MERS-CoV [35], IFNs production and MERS-CoV replication

448

peaked simultaneously in lungs at 2 dpi resulting in a sublethal infection. While early

449

induction or treatment with IFN were crucial for virus clearance and induction of

450

protective immunity, late administration of IFNs led in lungs to enhanced infiltrations of

451

monocytes, macrophages, neutrophils, expression of proinflammatory cytokines and

452

increased mortality. Also, indirect proof was given that IFNs synthesis was under sensing

453

of TLR7 but not MAVS in airway epithelial cells. However, this study did not report the

454

effect of MERS-CoV infection in the URT [35]. Benefits of early type I IFN treatment

455

were also shown for non-human primates [50] but IFN therapy on humans has failed so

456

far certainly because it was applied essentially on critically ill patients [51]. Thus, some

457

differences are noticed between a MERS-CoV sublethal infection in mice and that

458

occurring in a natural host. Here, we highlighted the essential role of the nasal mucosa as

459

a main producer of IFNs upon MERS-CoV infection driving in combination with IL10 a

460

mild inflammatory response along the respiratory tract. The observation in alpacas of a

461

dimmed NLRP3 inflammasome is consistent with that found in bat primary immune cells

462

infected in vitro with MERS-CoV [32], suggesting a primary role in the control of

463

inflammation in reservoir/intermediary hosts despite high viral loads. Further, this study

464

provides mechanistic insights on how innate immunity overcomes a MERS-CoV

465

infection. A proposed model of cytokine and signaling pathways interactions resuming

466

innate immune responses upon MERS-CoV infection in the respiratory tract of alpacas is

467

depicted in Fig 8. Inherent to any study performed with large outbred animals under BSL3

468

containment, the present study suffers some limitations. First, the number of animals used

469

was kept to minimal to avoid prolonged exposure of personnel during sampling and

470

necropsies hindering some statistical significances with variations between animals.

471

Second, the LCM and microfluidic PCR allowed determination of gene expression at the

Cell culture and virus

484

A passage 2 of MERS-CoV Qatar15/2015 isolate (GenBank Accession MK280984) was

485

propagated in Vero E6 cells and its infectious titer was calculated by determining the

Total RNA isolation and cDNA synthesis

505

Total RNA extraction from micro-dissected or scraped tissues was performed using the

of individual samples from infected animals at different dpi were used for comparison

534

against the NQ mean of three non-infected control animals (calibrator) per assay. Thus,

535

the up- or down-regulated expression of each gene was expressed in fold changes (Fc)

536

after dividing each individual NQ value with the calibrator. Unlike all other tested genes,

537

IFNβ mRNA was undetectable in the nasal epithelia of non-infected control animals,

538

therefore, comparisons for this gene in the nasal epithelia were performed in relation to

539

the mean of IFNβ levels of three infected alpacas on 1 dpi. C-F in S3 Table recompiles

540

all the results expressed in Fc relative to the control alpacas obtained with the Fluidigm

541

microfluidic assay for all 37 genes tested. A in S3 Table shows the quantification,

542

expressed in Cq values, of MERS-CoV genomic (UpE) and subgenomic RNA (M

543

mRNA), obtained with the microfluidic qPCR assay. B in S3 Table indicates the

544

expression levels (in Cq values) of all genes from non-infected alpacas euthanized at 0

545

dpi. The limit of detection for expressed genes was Cq=25. A logarithmic 10

546

transformations were applied on Fc values to approach a log normal distribution. Thus,

547

the Student’s t-test could be used to compare the means of the logarithmic Fc obtained at

548

different dpi for each group of animals. Significant upregulation or downregulation of

549

genes was considered if they met the criteria of a relative Fc of ≥2-fold or ≤2-fold

550

respectively with P < 0.05. Having determined that RT-qPCR data (Cq values) are

551

normally distributed according to the Shapiro-Wilk normality test, the Tukey's multiple

552

comparisons test was applied to compare Cq values of tissue samples at different dpi.

553

Differences were considered significant at P < 0.05. Correlation coefficients were

554

determined using the Spearman’s correlation test.

Fig 8. Proposed mechanistic model for MERS-CoV-induced protective innate

865

immune responses in alpaca respiratory tracts. (A) Upon MERS-CoV infection of

866

nasal epithelial cells, PRRs and IRFs are engaged to induce IFNs and ISGs exerting their

867

effects in an autocrine or paracrine manner. Upregulation of IL10 combined with the

868

action of type III IFNs will result in a dimmed synthesis of proinflammatory cytokines

869

under NF-κB control. Induced chemokines lead to focal, mild infiltration of leukocytes.

870

The paracrine effect of IFNs is evidenced in the nasal submucosa where ISGs are

871

upregulated without endogenous induction of IFNs. IL10 and type III IFNs will act on

872

the NF-κB pathway preventing production of IL8 and IL1β mRNAs depriving the NLRP3

873

inflammasome of its substrate. Slight increased levels of IRF5 mRNAs will indicate the

874

presence of few M1 macrophages in the submucosa. Blue, red and white arrows indicate

875

upregulation, downregulation and unaltered gene transcription respectively. (B)

876

Concomitant to decreased viral loads, transcription of ISGs is lowered in trachea and

877

lungs where IFNs are not induced. Infiltration of mainly mononuclear leukocytes occurs

878

in the lungs as a result of chemokine synthesis in the absence of IRF5 induction but

879

upregulation of IL15. Thus, reduced number of M1 macrophages and activation of NK

880

cells will contribute to a controlled inflammation and clearance of the virus. PI, Pro-

S6 Fig. Pattern recognition receptors (PRRs), IFN signaling and pro-inflammatory

965

cytokine pathway involving antiviral innate immunity induced by RNA viruses.

966

Upon sensing of RNA viruses, PRRs interact with their associated adapter proteins,

967

thereby transmitting downstream signals to nuclear factor (NF-κB) and interferon

968

regulatory factors (IRF3, IRF5 and IRF7) which further stimulate the production of pro-

969

inflammatory cytokines (IL6, IL8, IL15, TNFα, CCL3, CCL2 CXCL1, NLRP3 and pro-

970

IL1β) and IFNs (predominantly type I and III IFNs), respectively. Importantly, IRF5, is

971

also a potent inductor of pro-inflammatory cytokines. The production of IFNs enhances

972

the release of interferon stimulated genes (ISGs) which exert both, antiviral and host gene

973

regulatory activities. IFNs can act in an autocrine and paracrine manner to induce the

974

expression of ISGs via the JAK- STAT signaling pathway. While type I and III IFNs

975

induce a similar set of ISGs (RIG1, MDA5, STAT1, IRF3, IRF5, IRF7, CXCL10, MX1,

976

OAS1, ISG15, TRIM25), type I IFN signaling also activates pro-inflammatory cytokines

977

and chemokines, which in turn recruit leukocytes to the site of infection. IL10 functions

978

as an anti-inflammatory cytokine that activates STAT3 which is involved in the negative

979

regulation of NF-κB. AZI2 and TBK1 (which also phosphorylate IRFs) participate

980

positively in the NF-κB signaling pathway while IκBα inhibits translocation of NF-κB in

981

the nucleus until degradation. Activation of the inflammasome, composed of NLRP3,

982

PYCARD (ACS) and pro-CASP1 leads to the auto- cleavage of pro-CASP1 releasing

983

CASP1 which further cleaves pro-IL1β into its mature form. The pro-apoptotic enzyme

984

CASP10 and the adaptor CARD9 (acting downstream of C- type lectins signaling and

upstream of the NF-κB pathway) are not represented in the diagram but were assayed for
