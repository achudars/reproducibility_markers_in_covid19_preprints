SUMMARY
SARS-CoV-2, the virus responsible for the current COVID-19 pandemic, displays a coronashaped layer of spikes which play fundamental role in the infection process. Recent structural
data suggest that the spikes possess orientational freedom and the ribonucleoproteins segregate
into basketlike structures. How these structural features regulate the dynamic and mechanical
behavior of the native virion, however, remain unknown. By imaging and mechanically
manipulating individual, native SARS-CoV-2 virions with atomic force microscopy, here we
show that their surface displays a dynamic brush owing to the flexibility and rapid motion of
the spikes. The virions are highly compliant and able to recover from drastic mechanical
perturbations. Their global structure is remarkably temperature resistant, but the virion surface
becomes progressively denuded of spikes upon thermal exposure. Thus, both the infectivity and
thermal sensitivity of SARS-CoV-2 rely on the dynamics and the mechanics of the virus.

One sentence summary
The native coronavirus 2 displays a dynamic surface layer of spikes, a large mechanical
compliance and unique self-healing capacity.

INTRODUCTION
Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), the infective agent behind
the current coronavirus disease (COVID-19) pandemic (Zhou et al., 2020; Zhu et al., 2020), is
an enveloped ssRNA virus with a corona-shaped surface layer of spikes that are thought to play
an important role in the infection mechanism (Hoffmann et al., 2020; Shang et al., 2020; Walls
et al., 2020; Wang et al., 2020; Watanabe et al., 2020). Structural information about the spike
protein has been acquired either on crystals of purified protein (Henderson et al., 2020;
McCallum et al., 2020; Walls et al., 2020; Wrapp et al., 2020) or on fixed and frozen virus
particles (Ke et al., 2020; Turonova et al., 2020; Yao et al., 2020). It has been suggested that
the spike hinges provide structural flexibility (Ke et al., 2020; Turonova et al., 2020). Highresolution cryoelectron tomography observations indicate that the ribonucleoprotein (RNP) of
SARS-CoV-2 is partitioned into spherical, basketlike structures (Yao et al., 2020). However,
the surface dynamics and mechanical properties of native virions remain to be understood. Here
we employed atomic force microscopy (AFM) and molecular force spectroscopy (de Pablo and
Schaap, 2019; Kellermayer et al., 2018; Kiss et al., 2020) to investigate the topographical and
nanomechanical properties of native SARS-CoV-2 virions immobilized on an anti-spikeprotein functionalized substrate surface. The unique single-particle approach revealed that the
surface layer of spikes on SARS-CoV-2 is highly dynamic, the virion is unusually compliant
and resilient, and it displays an unexpected global thermal stability.

RESULTS AND DISCUSSION
High-resolution topography of chemically fixed SARS-CoV-2
The topographical structure of individual SARS-CoV-2 virus particles bound to substrate
surface was imaged by using AFM (Fig.1.a). To increase the efficiency and specificity of
binding we employed a monoclonal anti-spike-protein antibody, which resulted in a nearly
hundred-fold enhancement in the density of substrate-bound virions (Fig. S1). AFM images of
glutaraldehyde-fixed SARS-CoV-2 revealed spherical virions (Fig.1.b) with somewhat
variable dimensions (Table S1) and a rugged surface (Fig.1.c). The mean central height of the
virions (Fig. S2), the structural parameter least sensitive to AFM tip convolution, was 62 nm
(± 8 nm, S.D.) The height was smaller than the virion diameter measured in cryo-electron
microscopic images (Ke et al., 2020; Turonova et al., 2020; Yao et al., 2020), suggesting that
the virus particles were partially flattened on the substrate. The 3D-rendered AFM image
(Fig.1.d) supported this interpretation and revealed that the rugged surface is due to the
presence of protrusions which we identify as the spikes (S protein trimers). In high-resolution
(pixel size 5 Å) AFM images (Fig.1.e) individual S trimers were resolved. Visual inspection of
the S trimers pointed at their positional, rotational and flexural disorder in the viral envelope.
The mean nearest-neighbor distance between the S trimers, and their topographical height were
21 nm (± 6 nm, S.D.) and 13 nm (± 5 nm, S.D.), respectively (Fig. S3, Table S2). From the
mean nearest-neighbor distance and the virion dimensions we calculated that an average 61
spikes cover the SARS-CoV-2 virus particle surface. This number exceeds those reported
recently (24 (Ke et al., 2020), 26 (Yao et al., 2020) and 40 (Turonova et al., 2020)), suggesting
that the spike number is highly variable and may be regulated during virus assembly and
maturation. The flexural disorder observed here supports the interpretation of cryo-electron
microscopic data (Ke et al., 2020; Turonova et al., 2020; Yao et al., 2020), revealing a high
degree of spike flexibility. We propose that the positional and rotational disorder of S trimers
are due to their mobility in the virus envelope.
Structure and dynamics of native SARS-CoV-2
To circumvent the effects caused by chemical fixation and uncover the spike dynamics in situ,
we investigated the topography of unfixed, native SARS-CoV-2 virions (Fig.2). Unexpectedly,
we were unable to resolve S trimers on the virion surface at any of the investigated scanning
strengths (Fig. S4); rather, the virus particles displayed a blurred, smooth surface (Fig.2.a). The
mean central height of the native virions was 83 nm (± 7 nm, S.D.), which is significantly
greater than that observed for the fixed (Fig.2.b). We interpret the blurring of virion topography

as the result of aperture error caused by time averaging of spike movement within the sampling
region of each image pixel, hence the increase in virion height is caused by the AFM tip
scanning an apparent dynamic surface (Fig.2.c). Considering that the typical pixel sampling
frequency (fs) in these images was 308 Hz, the frequency of spike dynamics exceeds the Nyquist
frequency of fs/2 (154 Hz). Because the pixel size (d) is 2 nm, the spikes dynamically fluctuate,
within a space limited by their flexible neck, with a speed (v=dfs/2) exceeding ~0.3 nm/ms.
Most plausibly, spike motion is dictated by the Brownian dynamics of the receptor-bindingdomain (RBD) trimer which may then be thought of as a tethered particle. Spike mobility in
the virus envelope may contribute further to the observed dynamics. An alternative explanation
for the observed blurred virion surface is that the spikes evade the moving AFM cantilever tip
which then scans the envelope surface. We exclude this possibility, however, because, while it
relies on a similarly dynamic spike behavior, a reduced virion height should have been
observed. We speculate that the rapid spike motion revealed by these experiments contributes
to an efficient dynamic search by the virion on the surface of the targeted host cell, which
explains why SARS-CoV-2 is at least as infective as the influenza virus (Petersen et al., 2020)
in spite of its fewer spikes (up to ~60 in SARS-CoV-2 versus up to ~350 in influenza A (Harris
et al., 2006)).
Nanomechanics of SARS-CoV-2 virions
We investigated the mechanical properties of SARS-CoV-2 by lowering the cantilever tip on
the vertex of individual virions selected on the AFM image (Fig.3.a). The virion was indented
by pressing the tip downwards (Fig.3.b) with constant velocity (typically 0.5 µm/s) until a preset maximum force, measured by the cantilever deflection, was reached (typically 2-3 nN).
Such a nanomechanical manipulation did not result in permanent topographical changes
(Fig.3.c) in spite of completely compressing the virion so that the tip reached all the way to the
substrate resulting in a wall-to-wall deformation (Fig.3.d). In the initial stage of indentation,
immediately following the landing of the tip on the virion, we observed a linear force response
that allowed us to measure virion stiffness (Table S3). Mean stiffness was 13 pN/nm (± 5
pN/nm, S.D.), which makes SARS-CoV-2 the most compliant virus investigated so far (Cieplak
and Robbins, 2013; Mateu, 2012). Virion stiffness is somewhat lower than that measured for
the influenza virus lipid envelope (Li et al., 2011), suggesting that the elasticity of SARS-CoV2 is dominated by its envelope, and the RNP contributes little to the overall viral mechanics.
The elastic regime was followed by a yield point marking the deviation from the linear force
response and the onset of force-induced structural transitions which continued to take place

until total compression. Unlike in other viruses (de Pablo, 2018; de Pablo and Schaap, 2019),
force did not drop to near zero values following mechanical yield, indicating that virion collapse
or breakage was not evoked in spite of the drastic mechanical perturbation. Conceivably, the
mechanical yield is made possible by the force-induced rearrangement of the basketlike
structures of the RNPs (Yao et al., 2020). Subsequent to indentation we retracted the cantilever.
Remarkably, the virion generated forces up to several hundred pN during retraction, suggesting
that structural recovery was taking place, possibly driven by the structural restitution of the
initial RNP arrangement. The process continued until the initial virion height was reestablished. The mean force-spectroscopical height was 94 nm (± 10 nm, S.D.), which is
comparable to that obtained from topographical data. The differences between the indentation
and retraction force traces revealed a force hysteresis indicating that part of the mechanical
energy invested in distorting the virion was dissipated as heat. We were able to continue the
indentation-retraction cycles up to 100 times, but the virions never broke or collapsed (Figs.3.ef). Rather, both the indentation and retraction force traces relaxed after about a dozen
mechanical cycles, resulting in a minimized force hysteresis. The force response may
potentially be explained by two other mechanisms alternative to virion compression. The first
one is the force-induced virion rolling on the substrate. We exclude this possibility, because,
due to the presence of anti-spike-protein antibodies on the surrounding surface, the process is
expected to be completely irreversible. The second is the sideways slippage of the cantilever
tip, off of the virion surface. We exclude this possibility based on a calibration of the cantilever's
lateral torsion (Fig. S5) and because this process is expected to be completely reversible. We
can only speculate about the mechanisms behind the persistent structural self-healing of SARSCoV-2. Conceivably, the process involves the dynamic interaction between the RNA, protein
and lipid components. Notably, in some (~1 %) of the retraction traces we observed sawtoothshaped force responses, the peak forces of which fall between ~210-330 pN (Fig.3.f). The most
plausible explanation is that the force peaks correspond to the mechanically-driven unfolding
of S protein domains (Moreira et al., 2020). Altogether, the SARS-CoV-2 virion is a
mechanically stable, remarkably compliant and surprisingly resilient nanoparticle.
Thermal sensitivity of SARS-CoV-2
To assess the thermal stability of SARS-CoV-2, we explored the topographical changes of
virions exposed to high-temperature treatment (Fig.4). The sample was exposed to temperatures
of 60 (Fig.4.a), 80 (Fig.4.b) and 90 ˚C (Fig.4.c) for ten minutes then cooled back to 20 ˚C for
AFM imaging. Remarkably, virions remained on the substrate surface, and their global

appearance was only slightly altered. Virion topography became somewhat faceted, but the
particles retained their blurred, smooth surface. To test whether spikes were still present
following thermal exposure, we fixed the sample with 5% glutaraldehyde (Fig.4.d). Although
the rugged topography, seen in chemically fixed SARS-CoV-2 virions (Fig.1.c), was partially
restored, the spikes were much fewer, less distinct, and their trigonal shape (Fig.1.e) could not
be resolved (Fig.4.e), suggesting they became thermally denatured. Furthermore, the smooth
areas interspersed between rugged regions indicate that thermal treatment resulted in a
progressive dissociation of the S trimers from the virion surface. Thus, the SARS-CoV-2 virion
displays an unexpected global thermal stability, which is likely related to their aerosol and
surface stabilities (van Doremalen et al., 2020). However, the conformational response of the
spike proteins observed here eventually leads to the heat-induced inactivation of SARS-CoV2.
CONCLUSIONS
The atomic force microscopic imaging and nanomechanical measurements revealed that the
SARS-CoV-2 virion is highly dynamic, compliant and resilient, and it displays remarkable
mechanical and global thermal stabilities. While the dynamics of the surface spikes may play
an important role in the unusually high infectivity of the virus, its mechanical and self-healing
properties may also ensure adaptation to a wide range of environmental circumstances.
Considering its capability of exploring viruses under native conditions, the single-particle
approaches employed here may be important in uncovering not only the mechanistic details
behind viral infection but the viral response to potential therapies as well.

MATERIALS AND METHODS
Sample preparation
SARS-CoV-2 was isolated from the oropharyngeal swab of a laboratory-confirmed COVID-19
patient in Hungary and passed two times in VeroE6 cell line (European Collection of
Authenticated Cell Culture, Salisbury, U.K.) in Dulbecco′s Modified Eagle′s Medium (Lonza,
Basel, Switzerland) supplemented with 5% fetal bovine serum (EuroClone, Pero, Italy) and
Cell Culture Guard (PanReac AppliChem, Darmstadt, Germany). To remove the disturbing
effects of fetal bovine serum albumin, an additional passage was carried out in VP-SFM serumfree, ultra-low protein medium (Gibco, ThermoFisher Scientific) supplemented with Lglutamine (Sigma-Aldrich, Merck, Darmstadt, Germany). Four days after inoculation, when
full cytopathic effects were observed, the virus-containing medium was collected and
centrifuged (3000 x g) to remove debris. To concentrate the virus, the supernatant was
ultracentrifuged (70,000 x g, 1.5 hours, 4°C) in 13.5-ml lockable plastic tubes using a Sorvall
MTX-150 ultracentrifuge. The supernatant was removed and the pellet was resuspended in 100
µl VP-SFM. All sample preparation steps were performed in biosafety level-3 (BSL-3)
conditions.
Preparation of affinity-enhanced substrate surface
100 µl of 0.1% w/v poly-L-lysine (PLL) (Merck, Darmstadt, Germany) solution was pipetted
onto a freshly cleaved mica surface (Ted Pella, Redding, CA) and incubated for 20 minutes,
following which the surface was rinsed with distilled water and dried in N2 stream. 100 µl of
25% w/v grade I glutaraldehyde (GA) (Merck, Darmstadt, Germany) was then pipetted on the
surface and incubated for 30 min, followed by further rinsing with distilled water and drying in
N2 stream. Subsequently, 100 µl of 10 µg/ml recombinant protein G (Merck, Darmstadt,
Germany) was added and incubated for 30 minutes, then the surface was washed five times
each with 100 µl phosphate-buffered saline (PBS). 100 µl of 10 µg/ml SARS-CoV-2 Spike
Glycoprotein Antibody (#abx376478, Abbexa Ltd, Cambridge, UK) was then added, and the
surface was incubated for 1 hour. All surface functionalization steps were performed at room
temperature. Unbound antibodies were removed by repeated rinsing with PBS. The anti-spike
glycoprotein antibody-coated surfaces were stored under PBS for up to 5 days at 4 °C.
Handling virion sample in the AFM
An aliquot (20 µl) of purified SARS-CoV-2 sample was pipetted onto the anti-spike antibodycoated substrate surface and incubated at 37 ˚C for 30 minutes. To increase virion surface

density, another aliquot was added and incubated. The process was repeated twice.
Subsequently, the surface was rinsed gently with PBS to remove unbound virions. All the
sample-loading and washing steps were carried out in a laminar-flow hood in BSL-3 conditions
(at the National Biosafety Laboratory, National Public Health Centre, Hungary). For AFM
imaging of chemically fixed SARS-CoV-2, 100 µl 5% GA solution (in PBS) was added, and
the sample was incubated for >1 hour, ensuring both fixation and virus inactivation. Then, the
sample was carried to the AFM laboratory (Department of Biophysics and Radiation Biology,
Semmelweis University) for loading in the environmental scanner unit of the Cypher ES AFM
instrument. For imaging native virions, the fixation step was omitted and the sample was loaded
directly in the Cypher ES Scanner. To ensure compliance with safety measures, a closed
cantilever holder and gas-tight sample chamber was used, and the sample was loaded into the
scanner in a laminar-flow hood in BSL-3 conditions. Then the scanner was carried to the AFM
laboratory and inserted into the AFM instrument for imaging. To further comply with safety
measures, following AFM imaging the native virus samples were discarded in either of two
ways. In the first, the AFM scanner was taken to the BSL-3 laboratory for removal and chemical
desctruction of the sample. In the second, the sample was heated to 90 ˚C for >10 minutes with
the temperature-controller unit of the Cypher ES scanner. Then, the sample was removed for
immediate chemical destruction (5% NaClO).
AFM imaging and force spectroscopy
Atomic force microscopy imaging was carried out with an Asylum Research Cypher ES
instrument (Oxford Instruments, Santa Barbara, CA)(Kellermayer et al., 2018; Voros et al.,
2017). Resonant-mode (AC- or non-contact mode) scanning was performed under liquid in PBS
with BL-AC40TS (Olympus Corporation, Japan) cantilevers. The cantilever was oscillated near
its resonance frequency (tyically around 20 kHz) by using photothermal excitation at a typical
free amplitude of 0.5 V. Imaging was carried out at a typical setpoint of 350 mV and with
scanning speeds <1 µm/s to prevent the mechanical dislodging of virions from the substrate
surface. Alternatively, we used fast force mapping (FFM, or "jumping-mode" AFM(MorenoHerrero et al., 2004)) to collect image data. In FFM the cantilever was driven sinusoidally with
a typical frequency of 300 Hz and a setpoint force of 100 pN to obtain a force curve for each
pixel, from which the topographical image was reconstructed. The two (AC-mode and FFM)
imaging modes gave similar results. Thermal exposure of the virions was achieved by heating
the sample stage to pre-set temperatures(Voros et al., 2018). Force spectroscopic measurements
were carried out on virions selected on the AFM images. The cantilever was lowered, in contact

mode, onto the vertex of the virion with 0.5 µm/s velocity until the setpoint force was reached
(typically 2-3 nN). Cantilever spring constants were determined by the thermal method(Hutter
and Bechhoefer, 1993) prior to imaging. Spring constants were between 90-120 pN/nm.
Data analysis
Image postprocessing and data analysis were performed by using the AFM driving software
AR16, IgorPro 6.37 (Wavemetrics, Lake Oswego, OR). Particle analysis was carried out in
subsequent analytical steps. First, the particles were demarcated by masking at the full width at
half maximal height. Second, the mask was eroded, then dilated to gently smooth particle edges,
while also getting rid of small scanning artefacts. We ignored particles with extreme
deformities, ones too close to each other or with an area smaller than 3000 nm2. Height was
calculated at the center of the particles. Volume was calculated as the sum of the heights of
individual pixels of the particle multiplied by the spatial (x, y) scaling values to correct for
image pixel resolution. Particle diameter was calculated as the diameter of a circle with the
same area as the particle itself.

nearly intact, but the topography becomes progressively more rugged, pointing at the gradual
disappearance of the dynamic surface smoothing hence reduction of spike dynamics. d. AFM
image of an overview (1 x 1 µm) sample area following thermal treatment (90 ˚C for ten
minutes) and glutaraldehyde (5%) fixation. Inset, topographical profile plot measured along
the center of one of the virions (dotted line). The rugged surface topography is partially
restored, but large areas on the virions are devoid of spikes. e. High-resolution AFM image of
a heat-exposed (90 ˚C for ten minutes) and fixed (5% glutaraldehyde) SARS-CoV-2 virion.
Shallow surface protrusions are present.
