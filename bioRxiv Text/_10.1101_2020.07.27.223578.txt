Abstract
The recent global pandemic caused by the new coronavirus SARS-CoV-2 presents an urgent need for

new therapeutic candidates. While the importance of traditional in silico approaches such as QSAR in

such efforts in unquestionable, these models fundamentally rely on structural similarity to infer

biological activity and are thus prone to becoming trapped in the very nearby chemical spaces of already

known ligands. For novel and unprecedented threats such as COVID-19 much faster and efficient

paradigms must be devised to accelerate the identification of new chemical classes for rapid drug

development. Here we report the development of a new biological activity-based modeling (BABM)

approach that builds on the hypothesis that compounds with similar activity patterns tend to share

similar targets or mechanisms of action. In BABM, compound activity profiles established on massive

scale across multiple assays are used as signatures to predict compound activity in a new assay or

against a new target. We first trained and validated this approach by identifying new antiviral lead

candidates for Zika and Ebola based on data from ~0.5 million compounds screened against ~2,000

assays. BABM models were then applied to predict ~300 compounds not previously reported to have

activity for SARS-CoV-2, which were then tested in a live virus assay with high (>30%) hit rates. The most

potent compounds showed antiviral activities in the nanomolar range. These potent confirmed

compounds have the potential to be further developed in novel chemical space into new anti-SARS-CoV-

2 therapies. These results demonstrate unprecedented ability using BABM to predict novel structures as

chemical leads significantly beyond traditional methods, and its application in rapid drug discovery

response in a global public health crisis.

Introduction
The early-stage drug discovery process relies on target identification, assay development, and high

throughput screening (HTS) to identify lead compounds for chemical optimization and further preclinical

development. Traditional HTS campaigns are often limited to 1-2 million compounds due to the high

costs and operational bottle neck that limited the chance for lead identification.

drug-like compounds have been synthesized at least once, and that there are

drug-like molecules in chemical space, neither number is practical for HTS. However, recent

advances in computational technologies have made it possible to virtually screen millions of compounds

for potential biological activity.

Existing virtual screening (VS) methods can be grouped into two broad

categories: ligand-based VS and target structure-based VS. Ligand-based VS relies on the analysis of

quantitative structure-activity relationship (QSAR) of existing experimental data obtained from either

mechanistic or phenotypic compound screens, while target structure-based VS uses known protein

structure information to predict the binding potential of small molecule compounds to protein targets.

Both methods depend on chemical structure information to make predictions while the target-based

approach in addition requires the availability of detailed target protein information. These severe

dependencies have tended to limit the applicability of such methods to querying only in the close

structural vicinity of already known ligand structures and drug targets.

A critical advance that enabled the development of activity rather than structural paradigm described

3

here was the large-scale application of quantitative HTS (qHTS) . Every compound in an qHTS campaign

is tested in a broad concentration response format as opposed to in traditional HTS where compounds

are tested only at single concentrations. The high-quality data from qHTS are thus substantially richer

for use in computational modeling to predict activities of large compound libraries against new assays or

new drug targets. In the past 15 years, our in-house collections of over half a million compounds have

been screened in a wide spectrum of biological assays in qHTS format, which have been made publicly

available,

4

resulting in compound activity profiles that enabled the development of a new, biological

activity-based modeling (BABM) approach complementary to traditional structure-based approaches.

Unlike traditional QSAR approaches (part of the ligand-based VS category),

5,6

where similarity in

chemical structure is used to infer biological activity, BABM builds on the hypothesis that compounds

show similar activity patterns tend to share similar targets or mechanisms of action.

7,8

In this approach,

each assay is treated as an independent descriptor. Analogous to structure descriptors, where the

presence and absence of certain structure features or properties are used to represent a compound, the

presence and absence of activities against a panel of assays form the activity profile or signature of a

compound. If extracted from across multiple screening campaigns each at massive scale, such

activity

signatures can then be applied to infer compound activity in a completely new assay or against a
completely new target.

Analogous to a structural fingerprint, where the identity of each structural feature encoding the

fingerprint does not need to be known, only the pattern of compound activity across assays is critical in

BABM to make predictions whereas the identity of the individual assays forming the pattern is not

important. A fundamental difference compared to traditional QSAR modeling is thus that BABM does

not require any chemical structure information to make predictions, such that its application domain is

not limited to small molecules with well-defined structures. In fact, BABM can be applied to any

substances with available biological profiling, including macromolecules and mixtures (e.g. natural

products).

Of particular note is that compounds showing similar activities do not necessarily share similar

structures. Thus the BABM approach has no intrinsic limitations in discovering new chemical scaffolds in

contrast to traditional QSAR methods, and can be used to virtually screen new compound libraries for

which no activity data is available. These new scaffolds can then serve as starting points for lead

identification efforts and be used to construct new QSAR models for lead optimization.

Starting in late fall 2019, a highly contagious disease, coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), caused by a

new coronavirus, severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), emerged and quickly

spread across the globe.

9

As of June 2020, over 8.2 million people have been infected with over 440,000

fatalities (https://covid19.who.int/). Despite some promising results from repurposed drug candidates

that were shown to shorten the course of the disease (remdesivir

(dexamethasone

) or reduce mortality

), other efforts have been disappointing or controversial (e.g., Lopinavir-Ritonavir

,

), and an effective treatment has yet to be found for

this disease.

This presented an urgent need for new methods that can quickly and systematically screen large

compound libraries for new drug candidates. In this context, we first applied BABM to generate

prediction models for two infectious diseases, Zika and Ebola, to test the robustness of BABM and its

applicability to different assay and data types, and to benchmark against traditional QSAR methods,.

Zika virus (ZIKV) belongs to the family of flaviviruses that have caused global epidemics resulting in

human fatality.

The flavivirus non-structural protein NS1 has been found to interact with a number

of host molecules, and play many diverse roles in viral replication and virion maturation.

22

The large

qHTS

campaigns using in vitro EBOV assays have identified compounds that blocked virus entry into cells and

23,24

suppressed viral replication, but the identified active compounds exhibited low anti-EBOV potencies.

The BABM model identified actives that were experimentally verified with high confirmation rates (~50-

80%). The approach was then applied to build prediction models for SARS-CoV-2. Among our in-house

libraries, the NCATS Pharmaceutical Collection (NPC)

25

and the Library of Pharmacologically Active

Compounds (LOPAC) have been screened in nearly every one of our ~2,000 assays providing the most

comprehensive set of activity profiles that comprise an ideal training dataset for machine learning

models. To build prediction models for these disease targets, we selected training data that included

both qHTS assay data (SARS-CoV-2 and ZIKV NS1

CoV-2 and EBOV

26

) and data collected from published literature (SARS-

24

). These models, mostly trained on the qHTS activity profiles of the NPC and LOPAC

library compounds, were applied to predict the activity of all ~0.5 million compounds in our in-house

library. Models were constructed using BABM and the performances were compared with those of

traditional QSAR models as well as a combination of both activity and structural features. A little over

300 compounds identified by the BABM models as potential anti-SARS-CoV-2 leads were then tested in a

live virus assay with ~100 confirmed (>30%), validating the utility and accuracy of the BABM approach.

Some of the experimentally confirmed lead compounds may have the potential to be further developed

into new antiviral therapies.

Materials and Methods

Vero-E6 cells previously selected for high ACE2
expression (grown in EMEM, 10% FBS, and 1% Penicillin/Streptomycin) were cultured in T175
flasks and passaged at 95% confluency. Cells were washed once with PBS and dissociated from
the flask using TrypLE. Cells were counted prior to seeding. A CPE assay previously used to
measure antiviral effects against SARS-CoV was adapted for performance in 384 well plates
to measure CPE of SARS CoV-2 with the following modifications. Cells, harvested and
suspended at 160,000 cells/ml in MEM/1% PSG/1% HEPES supplemented 2% HI FBS, were
batch inoculated with SARS CoV-2 (USA_WA1/2020) at M.O.I. of approximately 0.002 which
resulted in approximately 5% cell viability 72 h post infection. Compound solutions in DMSO
were acoustically dispensed into assay ready plates (ARPs) at 3 point 1:5 titrations. ARPs were
stored at -20°C and shipped to BSL3 facility (Southern Research Institute, Birmingham, AL) for
CPE assay. ARPs were brought to room temperature and 5µl of assay media was dispensed to
all wells. The plates were transported into the BSL-3 facility were a 25 μL aliquot of virus
inoculated cells (4000 Vero E6 cells/well) was added to each well in columns 3-24. The wells in
columns 23-24 contained virus infected cells only (no compound treatment). A 25 μL aliquot of
uninfected cells was added to columns 1-2 of each plate for the cell only (no virus) controls.

After incubating plates at 37°C with 5% CO and 90% humidity for 72 h, 30 μL of Cell Titer-Glo
(Promega, Madison, WI) was added to each well. Following incubation at room temperature for
10 minutes the plates were sealed with a clear cover, surface decontaminated, and
luminescence was read using a Perkin Elmer Envision (Waltham, MA) plate reader to measure
cell viability.

NS1 TR-FRET assay

HEK293 cells were maintained in EMEM medium with 10% fetal bovine serum,

1% pen/strep (Gibco, Cat. # 15140–122). Cells were seeded at 1000 cells/3 µL/well in the white 1536-

well plate and incubated at 37M°C with 5% CO2 overnight. Compounds in dilution were added to cells at

23 nL/well and incubated for oneMhour followed by addition of 2 µL/well of the prototypic ZIKV strain,

MR766 solution to cells (MOIM=M0.5). After an incubation at 37M°C for 24Mh, 2.5 µL/well of detection

reagent mixture of two labeled anti-ZIKV NS1 antibodies was added to assay plates. TR-FRET signals

were measured using an Envision plate reader (PerkinElmer). Data were normalized by using the control

wells (without addition of ZIKV) as a negative control (0% NS1) and positive wells (with ZIKV) as 100%

NS1 level.

showed concentration dependent response with >30% efficacy were considered active. Other

compounds were considered inactive. Literature reported anti-SARS-CoV-2 compounds were considered

qHTS data generated in-house at NCATS were used to train the models for ZIKV NS1. NS1 activity data

house collection, the Genesis library, of ~90K diverse compounds was also screened for NS1 activity at a

single concentration (14 µM). From these results, compounds that showed >30% inhibition in both the

ratio and 615 nm readouts were considered active and other compounds were considered inactive.

The activity data on ~2,600 drugs screened in an EBOV assay from a literature report were used to train

the EBOV activity models.

24

These compounds were mapped to 2,065 unique compounds in the NCATS

compound library. The anti-EBOV activities (active or inactive) of these compounds were assigned

according to the literature report.

24

A subset of the compounds in the bioactive collections, NPC and LOPAC in particular, were screened in

nearly all the assays available at NCATS. Two NCATS in-house diverse compound libraries, Sytravon,

which contains ~44,000 compounds, and Genesis, which contains ~90,000 compounds, and a subset

(~100,000 compounds) of the other NCATS bioactive libraries and a large diverse compound library

(MLS), were also screened in subpanels of the NCATS assay portfolio. The bioactive compound activity

profiles in the assays that also screened the Sytravon (130 readouts), Genesis library (39 readouts), or

MLS (225 readouts) were used to train and test the activity-based models (BABM-S or BABM-G).

Structure fingerprints were generated for all compounds using the ChemoTyper

37

for the structure-

based models (SBM). Structure data on all the compounds with target activity data available were used

to train and test the SBM. The compositions of these datasets are summarized in

1

and the different types of models based on these datasets are summarized in

Supplementary Table

Table 1

. The assay

activity-based models (BABM-S, BABM-G, BABM-M) and the activity-structure combined models (CM-S,

CM-G, CM-M) were applied to predict the target activity of the compounds with activity profiles

available from the Sytravon/Genesis/MLS assays. The SBM was applied to predict the target activity of

all ~600K compounds in the NCATS compound library. For activity-based models, only compounds that

showed activity in at least 10% of the Sytravon, Genesis or MLS assay panel were kept for analyses.

Here, the definition of “active” is not as strict as what would normally be considered as a “hit” for lead

identification. Any type of concentration dependent activity observed, regardless of potency or efficacy,

was labeled as “active”. As such, compounds that showed activities in multiple assays are not

compounds that deemed “promiscuous” in the traditional sense.

Modeling

The Weighted Feature Significance (WFS) method previously developed at NCATS

38

was

applied to construct the models. Briefly, WFS is a two-step scoring algorithm. In the first step, a Fisher’s

exact test is used to determine the significance of enrichment for each feature in the active compounds

compared to inactive compounds, and a p-value is calculated for all the features present in the data set.

bioRxiv preprint doi: https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.07.27.223578; this version posted July 27, 2020. The copyright holder for this preprint (which
was not certified by peer review) is the author/funder. All rights reserved. No reuse allowed without permission.

For structure data, the feature value was set to 1 for compounds containing that structural feature and 0

for compounds that do not have that feature. For assay activity data, each assay readout was treated as

a feature and the feature value was set to 1 for “active” compounds and 0 for inactive compounds. If a

feature is less frequent in the active compound set than the inactive compound set, then its p-value is

set to 1. These p-values form what we call a “comprehensive” feature fingerprint, which is then used to

score each compound for its active potential according to Equation (1), where pi is the p-value for

feature i; C is the set of all features present in a compound; M is the set of features encoded in the

“comprehensive” feature fingerprint (i.e., features present in at least one active compound); N is the

number of features; and α is the weighting factor, which is set to 1 in all the models described here so

that all assay features and structure features are treated equally. A high WFS score indicates a strong

potential to be active.

WFS =

∑ log( p )
i

(1)

min(log( pi )) × (αN C − M + N M ∩C )

For each model, compounds were randomly split into two groups of approximately equal sizes, one used

for training and the other for testing. The randomization was conducted 10 times to generate 10

different training and test sets to evaluate the robustness of the models. Model performance was

assessed by calculating the area under the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve (AUC-ROC),

which is a plot of sensitivity [TP/(TP+FN)] versus (1-specificity [TN/(TN+FP)])

39

. A perfect model would

have an AUC-ROC of 1 whereas an AUC-ROC of 0.5 indicates a random classifier. The random data split

and model training and testing were repeated ten times, and the average AUC-ROC values were

calculated for each model. For external experimental validation of models, model performance was

measured by the positive predictive value (PPV = TP/(TP+FP)). Statistical significance was determined by

the Fisher’s exact test comparing model PPV with the active rate in the training dataset for the

corresponding target being modeled.

Selection of model predicted actives

Models with AUC-ROC >0.75 were considered for compound

selection. WFS score cutoff values for model predicted actives were determined using the ROC curves

where both sensitivity and specificity were optimized. Only compounds that scored higher than the

cutoff values were considered candidates for follow up selection. Due to the limitations of different

assays and resources, for each target we selected compounds with the largest possible structure

diversity that could fit into one 1,536-well plate for experimental validation. When the candidate pool

was much larger than the target number of compounds, the candidates were narrowed down based on

structure type. For this purpose, the entire NCATS in-house compound library was clustered based on

structure similarity (729-bit ChemoTyper

37

fingerprints) using the self-organizing map (SOM) algorithm

40

.

From the clusters that contain model predicted actives, a fraction of the active compounds was selected

from each cluster based on the WFS score and the number of models that predicted the compound as

active. Because the EBOV assay could only test ~100 compounds, the anti-EBOV candidates were

manually inspected and narrowed down further based on literature reports, structure novelty and

ADME properties. In most cases the selection was driven by availability of physical samples. All

compounds that met the WFS score cutoff from a model were selected when less than 1,408

compounds had physical samples available for cherry picking. The SARS-CoV-2 CPE assay (live virus)

could only be run in 384-well format. Limited by the testing space available and physical sample

availability, only 311 model predicted compounds were selected for experimental confirmation in the

SARS-CoV-2 live virus assay.

Results
Model performance and validation

Table 2

provides an overview of the three viral targets (SARS-CoV-2, ZIKV, EBOV) used for modeling. The

entire model training, testing and validation process is illustrated in

Figure 1

. Model performance was

measured by the area under the ROC curve (AUC-ROC; see Methods section for details). The majority of

the models performed well on their corresponding test sets with mean AUC-ROC values >0.8 (

and

Figure 2A

Supplementary Table 2

). The structure-activity combined models (CM) showed the best

performances compared to the models built on activity (BABM) or structure (SBM) alone with mean

AUC-ROC values >0.83. Of the BABM models using data from different assay panels and compound

libraries, the BABM-S and BABM-M models all showed good performances with mean AUC-ROC values

of 0.79 and 0.84, respectively (

Supplementary Table 2

). The BABM-G models with the smallest assay

panel for training showed the lowest AUC-ROC values averaging 0.75. The structure-based models

generally showed lower performances than the CM and BABM models with a mean AUC-ROC of 0.72.

Supplementary Figure 1

shows example ROC curves from each of the three types of models.

To further validate the models and identify new compounds with antiviral activity, a subset of model

predicted actives was selected for each viral target for experimental validation. For ZIKV, 1,676 selected

actives predicted by the model were tested in the original NS1 assay

26

that generated the data to train

the models. To validate the EBOV models, the EBOV-eGFP infection assay

26,41

was applied to test 96

selected model predicted EBOV actives. All 96 compounds were first inspected at 30 µM for potential

cytotoxicity, resulting in 62 compounds with <50% cell killing, which were further tested for EBOV

infection inhibition. The EBOV inhibition activity of these 62 compounds were used to evaluate model

performance. The positive predictive value [PPV = TP/(TP+FP)], i.e., the fraction of model predicted

actives that are experimentally confirmed, was calculated for each model (

Figure 2B

and

Supplementary

Table 2

). The model PPVs ranged from 30% (SBM for NS1) to 89% (CM-G for EBOV). The EBOV models

showed higher PPVs (~80%) than the NS1 models (~40%). Compared to the active rates in their

corresponding training datasets (i.e. original assay hit rate), all model predicted active sets were

significantly enriched with true active compounds (Fisher’s exact test: p<10

-10

Supplementary Table 2

) (

).

For example, the active rate of the EBOV BABM-S model training set was 11.8% and the corresponding

model PPV (i.e. experimental validation set active rate) was 80%. Thus the enrichment of actives by the

EBOV BABM-S model was 6.8-fold (80/11.8). The enrichment of actives for all models (

from 2.7-fold (BABM-S for NS1; p<10

-20

) to 27.5-fold (SBM for NS1; p<10

-20

Table 2

) ranged

). Most models showed

enrichments between 5- and 10-fold when compared to the active rates in the training set. The potency

ranges of the experimentally confirmed actives are summarized in

Table 2

and

. The models

identified potent compounds with novel structures for all four disease targets with IC50s in the

Identification of novel anti-EBOV and anti-ZIKV compounds

Of the 50 compounds with anti-EBOV activity confirmed at 30 µM, we selected 27 that showed >90%

inhibition of EBOV infection with minimal cytotoxicity (>80% cell viability) to test in concentration-

response format (0.17 nM to 30 µM; 1:3 fold dilution; triplicate) to determine their EBOV inhibition

potency. All 27 compounds showed concentration dependent inhibition of EBOV infection with IC50s
ranging from 25 nM to 25 µM (

Figure 3A Supplementary Data 2
;

). Seven of these compounds were

potent with IC50 ≤5 µM and were not apparently cytotoxic or at least six times more potent in the EBOV
inhibition assay compared to the cell viability counter assay. Two of the seven compounds are known

drugs. Arbidol (or umifenovir) (IC50 ~5 µM) is an antiviral treatment for influenza infection used in Russia

Difeterol is used as an antihistamine drug in Japan.

44

Difeterol (IC50 ~3 µM) was also

identified as one of the active compounds from a high throughput screen using the EBOV entry assay.

23

The other five compounds have novel structures with no previously reported anti-EBOV activity. These

compounds have the potential to be developed into new antiviral therapies.

A subset (170) of the experimentally confirmed NS1-assay active compounds with relatively potent NS1

signal inhibition activity (IC50 <10 µM) and no apparent cytotoxicity were selected for secondary
confirmation with compounds tested at 11 concentrations in triplicate (

Figure 3B Supplementary Data
;

2

). Ten of the 170 compounds did not show activity in the secondary confirmation assay yielding a

confirmation rate of 94% for the NS1 assay. 29 compounds showed potent inhibition with IC50 <1 µM, 17
of which were not apparently cytotoxic or at least three times more potent in the NS1 assay. A number

of these potent compounds are known drugs or bioactives. Colchicine, podofilox, 7-epi-docetaxel and β-

peltatin are all microtubule inhibitors. Colchicine is a medication most commonly used to treat gout and

as an anti-inflammatory drug for a number of other conditions. Podofilox, or podophyllotoxin, is used as

a medical cream to treat genital warts and molluscum contagiosum. 7-Epi-docetaxel is an impurity of

docetaxel, a chemotherapy medication used to treat a number of types of cancer. β-Peltatin is a plant

metabolite with antineoplastic properties that belongs to the same structural class as podophyllotoxin.

45

Dolastatin 10, a pentapeptide, is also an inhibitor of microtubule assembly and an investigational drug

that has been in clinical trials for its antineoplastic activity.

45

Like colchicine, narciclasine, an

amaryllidaceae alkaloid, was intensively investigated as an antitumor compound both in vitro and in vivo

Identification of novel anti-SARS-CoV-2 compounds

The activity of 311 compounds predicted by the SARS-CoV-2 BABM models were tested in the live virus

CPE assay, 99 of which were confirmed as active, yielding a hit rate of 32% (

Figure 2B

and

Supplementary Table 2

). The model PPVs ranged from 32% (CM-S) to 38% (BABM-S). Compared to the

active rates in their corresponding training datasets, all model predicted active sets were significantly

enriched with true active compounds (Fisher’s exact test: p<10

) (

to the hit rate of the original NPC screen (11%), the models were able to improve the hit rate by 2.8- to

3.3-fold (

). The SBM was not used for compound selection because its performance (average

AUC-ROC = 0.71) during model training and testing did not meet the 0.75 cutoff. Nonetheless, the SBM

predictions made on the 311 compounds were used to assess the performance of the SBM on the

experiment validation set in comparison with the BABM models (

Discussion
Traditional QSAR models rely on chemical structure similarity to infer biological activity and thus are

limited in their power to discover new chemical scaffolds. Consequently biological activity predictions

made on chemicals with structure types not included in the training set are often not reliable – this is

commonly referred to as the “applicability domain” (AD) issue.

60

QSAR models are thus fundamentally

restricted by their ADs, namely by the chemical spaces within which the models were originally trained.

Incorporating biological response patterns into the models helps to alleviate this issue by expanding the

model AD to cover structurally dissimilar chemicals that share similar activity profiles. Activity-based

modeling is a relatively new concept, especially when applied to drug discovery. The prerequisite of

activity-based modeling is the availability of sets of compounds tested consistently across multiple

biological assays with the results serving as compound descriptors or fingerprints. This is enabled by the

recent advances in HTS technologies that have produced a tremendous amount of biological activity

data in a relatively short amount of time. As a center specialized in HTS, NCATS has a data repository

that hosts biological response data on over half a million compounds tested against thousands of assays

mostly in qHTS format, which form a rich set of activity profiles at unprecedented scale (over 130 million

wells screened over the last 4 years) .

3,61

We show here that a subset of these data could be used to

build activity-based models to identify novel antiviral compounds for Zika and Ebola. After validating the

robustness of these models, we applied the BABM approach to build predictive models for the novel

SARS-CoV-2 producing lead compounds, confirmed in a live virus assays, with potential of being

developed into new COVID-19 therapies.

BABM was applied to ZIKV NS1 models as a proof-of-concept comparison to traditional modeling

approaches.

Supplementary Figure 2

shows the 652 experimentally confirmed NS1-expression actives

correctly identified by at least one of the three models (SBM, BABM, and CM). Only 43 of the 652

compounds were predicted as active by all three models. BABM identified 82%, while the CM and SBM

identified 76% and 28% of 652 active compounds, respectively. BABM and CM identified the majority of

the actives, most of which (448 out of 534) were also shared by both models. SBM identified a much

smaller number of actives, most of which (118 out of 182) were also different from those identified by

the BABM and CM. Out of the 118 actives picked up by the SBM only, 106 were not predicted by the

BABM or CM because no assay activity profile data were available on these compounds. As structure-

based models rely on structure similarity to make predictions, these models were not reliable in

predicting compounds with completely new scaffolds that were not already represented in the training

set. Activity-based models which rely on activity profile data for training, in contrast, are not restricted

by structure similarity and thus are potentially more powerful in discovering new scaffolds. Models for

all three viral targets in this study identified compounds with very low structural similarity to active

compounds in the training set (e.g., average Tanimoto similarity scores to the training set as low as 0.04-

0.07;

Table 2

). Compared to traditional QSAR models built with chemical structure data alone, the BABM

identified compounds that are structurally distinct from the training set and the compounds identified

by the SBM (

Figure 4

), demonstrating the advantage of the BABM in discovering new chemical types.

Combining traditional structure-based models with BABM can maximize the chance of identifying the

best novel lead compounds as new candidates for any therapeutic target of interest. Both the BABM and

CM models used activity data in other assays as descriptors for training while the CM used structure

features in addition. The model predictions were further validated experimentally. Again using the NS1

models for example, even though the BABM identified a larger portion of the experimentally confirmed

actives (i.e., was more sensitive), the CM had a lower false positive rate (i.e., was more specific). Adding

structure information helped the CM to achieve a slightly improved PPV. For all three viral targets

modeled in this study, the CM models achieved the best overall performance compared to the SBM and

BABM models. More intriguingly, the sizes of the training sets for all the models were much smaller than

the prediction sets on which the models were applied, 30- to 100-fold for the BABM and CM models,

and up to 300-fold for the SBM (

Supplementary Table 1

). That models built on a small training set

performed well on predicting a much larger and more diverse set of compounds with accuracies on par

with or better than most in silico screening approaches further demonstrated that the models were

robust enough to be applicable to large and diverse compound collections to identify new leads.

1,62

The SARS-CoV-2 BABM models identified ~100 compounds that were experimentally verified to show

antiviral activity in a live virus assay. Some of these compounds have novel structures that could be

developed into new classes of antiviral therapeutics. Models built for Zika and Ebola also identified

potent new lead compounds. In addition, we provided the prediction results of ~5,000 compounds that

were predicted as active by the SARS-CoV-2 BABM models as a resource to the scientific community to

develop new anti-COVID-19 therapies. The activity-based approach was demonstrated here to be able

to be rapidly applied to identify new lead compounds for novel targets or disease phenotypes.

As a complement to structure-based approaches, either ligand or target structure-based, the additional

information provided by activity data is shown here to significantly improve the predictive power of VS

models. The novel chemical scaffolds identified by BABM from an existing screening library can also be

incorporated into new QSAR models to screen other chemical libraries more efficiently with no

bioactivity profiles available. Of note is that, in addition to HTS libraries, the general concept of BABM

can be extended to any type of biological data, such as genomics and proteomics data, data generated

on mixtures or antibodies, and clinical data, where clearly defined structure information is not available.

As such the BABM approach shows the promise of broad applications in different areas of biology.

Figure 1

. Biological activity-based modeling (BABM) process. For any biological target of interest, T (e.g.,

SARS-CoV-2, ZIKV NS1, EBOV), the model identifies the activity pattern of active vs. inactive compounds
based on the training data, which are activity profiles of a set of compounds across a diverse panel of
assays including T. The active signature is then matched against the activity profiles of a new set of
compounds across the same assay panel. The ability of the model to use this signature to correctly
identify actives from the new compound set is first tested using part of the data with known T activity
(the test set). An AUC-ROC value is calculated using the test set to evaluate the model performance. The
model is then applied to a set of compounds with unknown T activity (prediction set; e.g., Sytravon,
MLS, Genesis). Predictions are made on the new compounds based on their activity profile similarity to
that of the active signature for T. The predicted T actives are further validated experimentally for their
activity against T. Comparing experimental results with model predictions, true positives (TP) and false
positives (FP) are counted to determine the performance of the model. In the heat maps, each row
represents a compound, each column is an assay, and the heat map is colored by the compound activity.
