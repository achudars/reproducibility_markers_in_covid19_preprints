ABSTRACT
The outbreak of 2019 coronavirus disease (COVID-19), caused by severe acute respiratory
syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), has resulted in a global pandemic. Despite intensive
research including several clinical trials, currently there are no completely safe or effective
therapeutics to cure the disease. Here we report a strategy incorporating neutralizing antibodies
conjugated on the surface of a photothermal nanoparticle to actively capture and inactivate SARSCoV-2. The photothermal nanoparticle is comprised of a semiconducting polymer core and a
biocompatible polyethylene glycol surface decorated with neutralizing antibodies. Such
nanoparticles displayed efficient capture of SARS-CoV-2 pseudoviruses, excellent photothermal
effect, and complete inhibition of viral entry into ACE2-expressing host cells via simultaneous
blocking and inactivating of the virus. This photothermal nanoparticle is a flexible platform that
can be readily adapted to other SARS-CoV-2 antibodies and extended to novel therapeutic proteins,
thus providing a broad range of protection against multiple strains of SARS-CoV-2.

Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), resulting from severe acute respiratory syndrome
coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection, has spread worldwide and caused a global pandemic.1, 2
As of October 12, 2020, SARS-CoV-2 has infected over 37 million people and caused more than
one million deaths.3 The virus can induce severe symptoms such as acute respiratory distress
syndrome, cytokine release syndrome, and cardiovascular damage, as well as increase mortality in
patients.4-6 SARS-CoV-2 gains entry into cells through high affinity binding of the receptor
binding domain of the spike protein to the angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) receptor on
the host cell surface.7, 8
Vaccines in development to protect against SAR-CoV-2 infection have shown promising results
in phase 1 and 2 clinical trials,9-13 however the process to vaccine approval and deployment may
take months to years to realize. Moreover, it remains unclear whether vaccines will confer longterm protection, further complicating the path toward ending the pandemic.14 Currently, there are
limited therapeutic regimens proven to clear the viral infection in all patients evaluated. Existing
FDA-approved drugs have been applied to COVID-19 treatment and shown some success, but
specific, effective therapies have been yet to be clinically approved.15-17 In an alternative approach,
transfusion of convalescent plasma from recovered patients containing antibodies specific for
SARS-CoV-2 into COVID-19 patients was shown to reduce viral load and may limit the severity
or duration of illness in some patients due to the presence of pre-existing neutralizing antibodies.18
However, intravenous administration of convalescent plasma involves logistical hurdles, including
availability of donor plasma and the need for a designated medical facility.19
Antibody-dependent enhancement (ADE), caused by binding of non-neutralizing antibodies to
SARS-CoV-2, remains a concern for antibody-based vaccines, therapies, and convalescent plasma
because it can further aggravate a patient’s condition through enhancement of viral infection.20-23
High-affinity monoclonal neutralizing antibodies against SARS-CoV-2 may circumvent some of
the potential risk of ADE, as they often display much higher affinities for SARS-CoV-2 spike
protein (<1 nM)24-26 than those of ACE2 (~15–40 nM)27-30 and can be produced in mass scale.
Recently, several monoclonal neutralizing antibodies cloned using B cells from COVID-19
patients have been shown to effectively block the interaction between SARS-CoV-2 spike protein
and ACE2.31-35

Several nanomaterial-based approaches have been investigated for virus detection,36-39 vaccine
delivery,40, 41 and viral capture,42-44 however, the lack of a method to effectively capture and
inactivate the virus after binding—which may lead to ADE—remains to be addressed. Herein we
report the development of a strategy utilizing photothermal nanoparticles decorated with highaffinity neutralizing antibodies in order to effectively capture and inactivate SARS-CoV-2 (Figure
1a). Each photothermal nanoparticle contains a semiconducting polymer core, poly[2,6-(4,4-bis(2-ethylhexyl)-4H-cyclopenta

[2,1-b;3,4-b′]dithiophene)-alt-4,7(2,1,3-benzothiadiazole)]

(PCPDTBT), enabling generation of intensive local heat after being excited by suitable light
sources. In addition, photothermal nanoparticles can achieve highly specific and noninvasive
photothermal killing of biological targets such as virus, bacteria, and tumors without damaging the
surrounding healthy tissues.45-47 An amphiphilic polymer shell, 2-distearoyl-sn-glycero-3phosphoethanolamine-N-[methoxy(polyethylene glycol)-2000], is applied to encapsulate the
PCPDTBT core. The nanoparticle surface is functionalized with a monoclonal neutralizing
antibody specific to the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein which enables selective and efficient capturing
of SARS-CoV-2 with high affinity (0.07 nM), thus preventing the entry of SARS-CoV-2 into host
cells. Upon excitation by a 650-nm light-emitting diode (LED), which possesses a more desirable
safety profile compared to conventional laser excitation,48,

the photothermal nanoparticles

directly inactivate the captured SARS-CoV-2 by heat. The unique design of our photothermal
nanoparticles not only synergizes with the neutralizing function of the antibody in capturing
SARS-CoV-2, but may also mitigate the potential risks of ADE through direct inactivation of the
coronavirus via the photothermal effect.

as the matrix to encapsulate PCPDTBT through self-assembly.47 Subsequently, an anti-SARSCoV-2 neutralizing antibody was crosslinked to the nanoparticles via reaction of NHS esters with
amines on the antibody surface. Using dynamic light scattering (DLS), we determined the
hydrodynamic diameters of the photothermal nanoparticles to be ~ 90 nm, which was validated by
transmission electron microscopy (TEM) (Figure 1b). In addition, the photothermal nanoparticles
exhibited good stability without forming any aggregation or precipitation after being stored in
aqueous dispersions at 4 °C for several weeks (Figure S1). The ultraviolet to the visible light
absorption spectrum of the photothermal nanoparticles covers a broad range from 500 to 850 nm
in the red and near-infrared range, favoring their application as photothermal agents for lighttriggered inactivating of the SARS-CoV-2 using infrared excitation (Figure 1c). Surface
conjugation of the anti-SARS-CoV-2 neutralizing antibody (IgG2b) was further validated by
fluorescent imaging analysis. Briefly, DiOC18(7) (DiR) lipophilic dye capable of emitting a
fluorescent signal at ~780 nm was co-encapsulated in the photothermal nanoparticles (Figure 1d).
After immunostaining with a secondary Alexa Fluor-488-labeled anti-IgG2b antibody, subsequent
visualization by fluorescence microscopy indicated specific staining of the neutralizing antibodyconjugated photothermal nanoparticles, as demonstrated by good colocalization between the Alexa
Fluor-488 signal and the DiR dye (Pearson's correlation coefficient ≈ 0.9, calculated by ImageJ).

Since the photothermal nanoparticles exhibited excellent absorption in the near-infrared region,
we hypothesized that they could effectively generate local heating after light excitation with a
suitable wavelength. To test this hypothesis, we applied a 650-nm LED with a power density of
250 mW/cm2 to excite the photothermal nanoparticles, because it would fit the absorption

spectrum of the nanoparticles and could be safely used to excite healthy cells and tissues.48, 49 The
nanoparticles were dispersed in phosphate buffered saline (1 × PBS; pH 7.4) at a concentration of
100 µg/mL, then subjected to LED excitation. As expected, a time-dependent temperature increase
from 20 °C to 50 °C was observed within 10 min after light exposure (Figure 2a). In contrast, less
than 2 °C of temperature change was observed in PBS alone, indicating the effect was specific to
the nanoparticles (Figure 2a). Since the temperature of the entire solution exceeded 50 °C, we
rationalized that the local heating rate of the photothermal nanoparticles should be much higher,
and would thus enable effective inactivation of SARS-CoV-2. To test this hypothesis, we further
evaluated local temperature changes following excitation using an LED-coupled voltage-clamp
setup (Figure 2b) to understand the transient photothermal response of the nanoparticles.50 The
nanoparticles were drop-casted onto the glass coverslip and the aggregate was covered with a PBS
solution. The glass micropipette electrode was placed in close proximity to the surface of the
aggregated nanoparticles. Then, a 650-nm LED was used to deliver 10 ms light pulses and the
current response through the pipette was measured (Figure S2). The analysis revealed a 0.7 °C
increase in the local temperature after each light pulse (Figure 2c), which corresponds to an initial
heating rate of 70 °C/s. After the end of the pulse, the temperature decayed with a ∼28 ms time
constant. While the local temperature change observed in the measurement is lower than observed
previously for silicon nanostructures,51, 52 the light density used for excitation is more than 100times lower due to application of LED rather than focused laser. Additionally, the longer decay
time constant suggests higher thermal resistance at the organic nanoparticle-water interface
compared to inorganic nanostructures.50 The measurements further suggest strong photothermal
response produced by the nanoparticles, which we expected would inactivate the viral particles
due to the intense local heating.

was calculated from dose-response curve. Error bars indicate ± SEM. n = 3 per group.

Next, we sought to determine if we could use the newly engineered photothermal nanoparticles to
inhibit the infection of ACE2-expressing host cells by SARS-CoV-2. Due to the high risk of
infection associated with live SARS-CoV-2, we decided to utilize alternative replicationincompetent viruses pseudotyped with the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein in order to evaluate efficacy
of the nanoparticles. Pseudotyped viruses have been routinely employed to provide significantly
safer conditions in which to study highly infectious viruses.53-56 As an initial proof-of-concept, we
employed the vesicular stomatitis virus pseudotyped with the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein (SARSCoV-2 VSV-GFP). The SARS-CoV-2 VSV-GFP pseudovirus enables transient expression of
green fluorescent protein (GFP) upon entry into the host cell (Figure 3a), facilitating direct
monitoring of viral uptake following incubation with the nanoparticles and photothermal treatment.
In the absence of nanoparticles, HEK293T cells engineered to overexpress ACE2
(ACE2/HEK293T) were susceptible to pseudovirus infection as demonstrated by GFP expression

after 24 h incubation (Figure 3b). A dose-dependent containment of the pseudovirus was observed
upon addition of the antibody-conjugated photothermal nanoparticles (0.5 ~ 10 µg/mL) and 650nm LED excitation (250 mW/cm2, 10 min). Complete inhibition of pseudovirus infection was
achieved at a concentration of 5 µg/mL with an IC50 value of 1.68 µg/mL (Figure 3c, 3d and S3a),
demonstrating the good virus inactivation efficiency of the nanoparticles. To confirm this effect
was not dependent on the structure of the pseudovirus, we utilized a replication-incompetent
lentivirus pseudotyped with SARS-CoV-2 spike protein (SARS-CoV-2 lentivirus-GFP), which
stably integrates a gene encoding a GFP reporter into the host genome after infection (Figure 4a),
for the subsequent in vitro viral infection study. As expected, in the absence of nanoparticles, the
pseudovirus infected the ACE2/HEK293T cells, as indicated by GFP expression monitored at 48
h post infection (Figure 4b and S4a). After incubating with the neutralizing antibody-conjugated
photothermal nanoparticles and applying 650-nm LED excitation (250 mW/cm2, 10 min), infection
by the SARS-CoV-2 lentivirus-GFP was inhibited in a dose-dependent fashion when the
concentration of nanoparticles was increased from 0.5 µg/mL to 10 µg/mL, demonstrating
complete inhibition of pseudovirus infection at a concentration of 5 µg/mL and an IC50 of 0.23
µg/mL (Figure 4c, 4d, S3b, and S4b). Taken together, these data demonstrate the excellent
inhibitory role of our antibody-photothermal nanoparticles in inactivating the SARS-CoV-2
pseudoviruses through the synergistic effect of the neutralizing antibody and photothermal
treatment. Importantly, no toxicity was observed after treating the ACE2/HEK293T cells with
different concentrations of the photothermal nanoparticles (Figure S5), providing further support
for their safe use in biological systems.

CONCLUSION
In summary, we developed an antibody-conjugated photothermal nanoparticle for active capture
and inactivation of SARS-CoV-2. The nanoparticles displayed excellent photothermal properties
as demonstrated by generation of a significant amount of local heat upon LED light excitation in
a short time. In the virus neutralization experiments, the antibody-conjugated photothermal
nanoparticles together with LED excitation enabled successful capture and inactivation of two
different types of SARS-CoV-2 pseudoviruses, which resulted in complete protection against viral
infection in ACE2/HEK293T cells. The synergistic effect of antibody capture and photothermal
treatment provides an excellent virus neutralization efficiency. This work demonstrates a proofof-concept that photothermal inactivation could potentially serve as a preventative approach to
inhibit ADE that arises due to incomplete neutralization of the SARS-CoV-2 during SARS-CoV-

2 infection and vaccination. Finally, our photothermal nanoparticle provides a flexible platform
that can be readily adapted to target other strains of SARS-CoV-2 via conjugation to different
antibodies or other novel therapeutic proteins and can be extended to other viruses, bacteria57 and
malignant cells.58
MATERIALS AND METHODS
Preparation of Photothermal Nanoparticles
PCPDTBT (0.2 mg) and DSPE-PEG2000-NHS (2 mg) were dissolved and mixed in tetrahydrofuran
(500 µL).47 For DiR labeled nanoparticles, 0.04 mg of DiR was further added into the mixture.
The mixture was injected into 1 × PBS (10 mL) and sonicated using a probe sonicator (Qsonica
Ultrasonic Homogenizer) on ice for 2 min. THF was then evaporated by rotary evaporator. The
obtained nanoparticles were filtered through a 0.22 µm syringe filter and concentrated by
ultrafiltration (Amicon® Ultra-15 Centrifugal Filter Unit with 100 KDa cutoff, 4000 × g, 4 °C, 5
min). Anti-SARS-CoV-2 neutralizing antibodies were added into the nanoparticle solution with a
mass ratio of 1:10 (antibody: DSPE-PEG2000-NHS) and stirred overnight at 4 °C to complete the
conjugation.
Nanoparticle Characterization
The measurement of UV-vis absorption spectra was carried out using a UV-vis spectrophotometer
(Thermo Scientific NanoDrop™ 2000). The sizes of the nanoparticles were measured by dynamic
light scattering (DLS) particle size analyzer (Malvern Zetasizer). The sizes and morphologies of
the nanoparticles were studied by transmission electron microscopy (TEM, JEM-2010F, JEOL,
Japan).
Fluorescent Imaging of Photothermal Nanoparticles
The photothermal nanoparticles (100 µg/mL, 10 µL) was incubated with the secondary Alexa
Fluor 488-labeled anti-IgG2b antibody (100 µg/mL, 10 µL) for 1 h. Single particle fluorescent
images were captured by a fluorescence microscopy with a 100×/1.49 numerical aperture (NA)
objective using a Nikon Ti-E inverted microscope. A 7-color solid state LED light source was
connected with a liquid light guide to the microscope; the light then passes through a quad bandpass filter (ZET405-488-532-647m). The LED excitation wavelengths used were 470 ± 25 nm for

green channel and 740 ± 20 nm for red channel (Spectra X, Lumencor). The emissions from the
nanoparticles and Alexa Fluor-488 were captured by an Andor iXon Ultra 888 back-illuminated
electron multiplying CCD (EMCCD) camera (Oxford Instruments).
Photothermal Test of Photothermal Nanoparticles
Photothermal nanoparticles (100 µg/mL in 1 × PBS) were added into a well in a 96-well plate (flat
bottom, GenClone®). A 650-nm LED (Spectra X, Lumencor) was applied to excite the
nanoparticle solution for 10 min with a power density of 250 mW/cm2. The temperature changes
from 0 to 10 min were recorded by a probe thermometer. Each measurement was repeated three
times. Temperature changes of pure 1 × PBS were also measured using the same method.
Measurement of Transient Photothermal Response of Photothermal Nanoparticles
Photothermal response measurements were performed on an upright microscope (Olympus,
BX61WI) with a 20×/0.5 NA water-immersion objective. An LED light source (Lumencore
Spectra X) with a 650 nm filter was used for excitation and was electronically controlled using
transistor-transistor logic signals delivered from a digitizer (Molecular Devices, Digidata 1550).
Voltage-clamp measurements were performed using Axopatch 200B amplifier (Molecular
Devices). For the local temperature measurements, a pipette electrode (∼0.8 MΩ at room
temperature) filled with buffer solution (1 × PBS) was placed in a close proximity to the
nanoparticles aggregated on top of glass coverslip submerged in PBS solution. Heat-induced
currents were recorded in voltage-clamp mode. A laser pulse of 10 ms was delivered to the
preparation 100 ms after the voltage jumped 0.5 mV below the holding potential. Current traces
were recorded for the set of holding currents (Figure S2a) and the linear relationship between the
holding current and photothermal current was established for different time points (Figure S2b).
Temperature was inferred using a temperature-resistance calibration curve measured for the pipette.
In Vitro Viral Infection of SARS-CoV-2 VSV-GFP Pseudovirus
ACE2/HEK293T cells (5 × 104 cells) were seeded into 96-well plates (flat bottom, GenClone®)
and incubated overnight at 37 °C in a humified CO2 incubator. A dilution series of the photothermal
nanoparticles was prepared in a final volume of 50 µL of Dulbecco's Modified Eagle Medium
(DMEM) for a single well. Simultaneously, 15 µL of SARS-CoV-2 VSV-GFP (2 × 105 titering
units (TU)/mL) was diluted into DMEM to a final volume of 50 µL for a single well. The

photothermal nanoparticles and SARS-CoV-2 VSV-GFP were combined to a total volume of 100
µL and incubated at 37°C for 1 h. After the initial incubation, the mixtures were excited by the
650-nm LED for 10 min with a power density of 250 mW/cm2 and added to cells. After 2 h
incubation, 100 µL of fresh cell culture media were further added into each well. Each group
contains three wells for the subsequent imaging and quantification. After 24 h incubation, the cells
were imaged with Leica fluorescence microscope using 10×/0.30 NA objective. The LED
excitation wavelengths were 470 ± 25 nm for GFP (Spectra X, Lumencor). The emissions were
captured by an Andor iXon Ultra 888 back-illuminated EMCCD camera (Oxford Instruments).
GFP-positive cells were counted manually three times by objective and the viral infection rates
were calculated as the ratio of GFP-positive cells in the group incubated with the nanoparticles
and virus to that of the group incubated with virus alone.
In Vitro Viral Infection of SARS-CoV-2 Lentivirus-GFP Pseudovirus
ACE2/HEK293T cells (2 × 104 cells) were seeded into 96-well plates (flat bottom, GenClone®)
and incubated overnight at 37 °C in a humified CO2 incubator. A serial dilution of the photothermal
nanoparticles was prepared in a final volume of 50 µL of cell culture media for a single well.
Simultaneously, 10 µL of SARS-CoV-2 lentivirus-GFP (1 × 106 TU/mL) was diluted into cell
culture media to a final volume of 50 µL for a single well. The photothermal nanoparticles and
SARS-CoV-2 lentivirus-GFP were combined to a total volume of 100 µL and incubated at 37°C
for 1 h. After the initial incubation, the mixtures were excited by the 650-nm LED for 10 min with
a power density of 250 mW/cm2 and added to cells. After 48 h incubation, cells were washed with
1 × PBS and fixed in 4% [w/v] paraformaldehyde for 15 min. Cells were then washed with 1 ×
PBS and further stained with Hoechst 33342 nuclear stain (2 µg/mL) for 15 min. The GFP
expression monitored with a Nikon Ti-E inverted microscope using a 10×/0.30 NA objective. The
LED excitation wavelengths were 395 ± 25 nm for Hoechst 33342 and 470 ± 25 nm for GFP
(Spectra X, Lumencor). The emissions were captured by an Andor iXon Ultra 888 backilluminated EMCCD camera (Oxford Instruments). The numbers of total cells and infected cells
were counted in ImageJ using the following workflow: Adjust→Threshold (Otsu),
Process→Binary→Fill Holes→Watershed, Analyze→Analyze Particles. GFP expression was first
normalized to total number of cells as calculated by DAPI staining. Then, viral infection rates were
calculated as the ratio of normalized GFP positive cells in the group incubated with the virus and
nanoparticles to that of the group incubated with virus only.
