Abstract

19

The Coronaviridae are a family of viruses that causes disease in humans ranging from

20

mild respiratory infection to potentially lethal acute respiratory distress syndrome. Finding

21

host factors that are common to multiple coronaviruses could facilitate the development

22

of therapies to combat current and future coronavirus pandemics. Here, we conducted

23

parallel genome-wide CRISPR screens in cells infected by SARS-CoV-2 as well as two

Introduction

36

The Coronaviridae family includes seven known human pathogens, for which there are

37

no approved vaccines and only limited therapeutic options. The seasonally circulating

38

human coronaviruses (HCoV) OC43, HKU1, 229E and NL63 cause mild, common cold-

39

like, respiratory infections in humans 1. However, three highly pathogenic coronaviruses

40

emerged in the last two decades, highlighting the pandemic potential of this viral family 2–

41

4

42

Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) can lead to acute respiratory

43

distress syndrome and death, with fatality rates between 10-40% 5. SARS-CoV-2, which

44

is currently causing a global pandemic, is less deadly but far more transmissible than

45

SARS-CoV-1 and MERS-CoV, and has been responsible for over 32 million cases and

46

900,000 deaths globally so far 5,6. Because of the severity of their impact on global health,

it is critical to understand how SARS-CoV-2 and other coronaviruses hijack the host cell

48

machinery during infection, and apply this knowledge to develop new therapeutic

49

strategies.

50
51

Coronaviruses are enveloped, positive-sense, single-stranded RNA viruses with a

52

genome length of approximately 30kb. Upon receptor binding and membrane fusion, the

53

viral RNA is released into the cytoplasm, where it is translated to produce viral proteins.

54

Subsequently, the viral replication/transcription complexes form on double-membrane

55

vesicles and generate genome copies. These are then packaged into new virions via a

56

budding process, through which they acquire the viral envelope, and the resulting virions

57

are released from infected cells 7. During these steps, specific cellular proteins are

58

hijacked and play crucial roles in the viral life cycle. For example, the angiotensin-

59

converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) is exploited as the viral entry receptor for HCoV-NL63,

60

SARS-CoV-1 and SARS-CoV-2 8–10. Additionally, cellular proteases, such as TMPRSS2,

61

cathepsin L and furin, are important for the cleavage of the viral spike (S) protein of

62

several coronaviruses, thereby mediating efficient membrane fusion with host cells 11–15.

63

Systematic studies have illuminated virus-host interactions during the later steps of the

64

viral life cycle. For example, proteomics approaches revealed a comprehensive

65

interactome between individual SARS-CoV-2 proteins and cellular proteins

66

Additionally, biotin labelling identified candidate host factors based on their proximity to

67

coronavirus replicase complexes 18. While these studies uncovered physical relationships

68

between viral and cellular proteins, they do not provide immediate information about the

69

importance of these host components for viral replication.

functional genomics approach to distantly related Coronaviridae in order to probe for

83

commonalities and differences across the family. This strategy can reveal potential pan-

84

coronavirus host factors, thus illuminating targets for antiviral therapy to combat current

85

and potential future outbreaks. We conducted comparative CRISPR screens for SARS-

86

CoV-2 and two seasonally circulating common cold coronaviruses, OC43 and 229E. Our

results corroborate previously implicated host pathways, uncover new aspects of virus-

Results

91

CRISPR knockout screens identify common and virus-specific candidate host factors for

92

coronavirus infection

93

Phenotypic selection of virus-resistant cells in a pooled CRISPR KO screen is based on

94

survival and growth differences of mutant cells upon virus infection. We chose Huh7.5.1

95

hepatoma cells as they were uniquely susceptible to all tested coronaviruses. We readily

96

observed drastic cytopathic effect during OC43 and 229E infection (Extended Data Fig.

97

1a). Huh7.5.1 also supported high levels of SARS-CoV-2 replication but only displayed

98

limited virus-induced cell death (Extended Data Fig. 1b,c). To improve selection

99

conditions for the SARS-CoV-2 CRISPR screen, we overexpressed ACE2 and/or

100

TMPRSS2, which are present at low levels in WT Huh7.5.1 cells (Extended Data Fig. 1d).

101

This led to increased viral uptake of a SARS-CoV-2 spike-pseudotyped lentivirus,

102

confirming the important function of ACE2 and TMPRSS2 for SARS-CoV-2 entry

103

(Extended Data Fig. 1e). We ultimately used Huh7.5.1 cells harboring a bicistronic ACE2-

104

IRES-TMPRSS2 construct for the SARS-CoV-2 screen as these cells sustained efficient

105

infection that led to widespread cell death, while still allowing the survival of a small

106

number of cells (Extended Data Fig. 1c).

107
108

The three CRISPR screens - for resistance to SARS-CoV-2, HCoV-229E and HCoV-

109

OC43 - identified a compendium of critical host factors across the human genome (Fig.

110

1a, Supplementary Table 1). Importantly, the known viral entry receptors ranked among

111

the top hits: ACE2 for SARS-CoV-2 and aminopeptidase N (ANPEP) for 229E (Fig. 1b,c)

but primarily depends on sialic acid or glycosaminoglycans for cell entry 24,25; consistent

114

with this fact, multiple heparan sulfate biosynthetic genes (B3GALT6, B3GAT3,

115

B4GALT7, EXT1, EXT2, EXTL3, FAM20B, NDST1, SLC35B2, UGDH, XYLT2) were

116

identified in our OC43 screen (Fig. 1d, Extended Data Fig. 2a). Several of these genes

117

were also markedly enriched in the SARS-CoV-2 screen, consistent with a recent report

118

that SARS-CoV-2 requires both ACE2 and cellular heparan sulfate for efficient infection

119

(Fig. 1b, Extended Data Fig. 2a) 26. Overall, the identification of the expected entry factors

120

validates the phenotypic selection of our host factor screens.

121
122

Gene Ontology (GO) enrichment analysis found a number of cellular processes to be

123

important for multiple coronaviruses. These included proteoglycan and aminoglycan

124

biosynthesis, vacuolar and lysosomal transport, autophagy, Golgi vesicle transport and

125

phosphatidylinositol metabolic processes (Fig. 2a, Supplementary Table 2).

126

In the phosphatidylinositol metabolic process, the SARS-CoV-2 screen identified VAC14,

127

which is part of the PIKfyve kinase complex (Fig. 1b). PIKFYVE itself was moderately

128

enriched in the SARS-CoV-2 screen (Extended Data Fig. 2a). This complex catalyzes the

129

conversion of phosphatidylinositol-3-phosphate to phosphatidylinositol-3,5-bisphosphate,

130

which is localized to late endosomes

131

229E and HCoV-OC43 identified the subunits (PIK3C3, UVRAG, BECN1 and PIK3R4) of

132

the class III phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K) complex, which generates the precursor

endomembrane homeostasis and autophagy, to be critical for the life cycle of all three

137

and possibly all coronaviruses.

138
139

Another group of genes found in all three CRISPR screens are linked to cholesterol

140

metabolism. The SARS-CoV-2 resistant cell population contained multiple knockouts in

141

genes of the sterol regulatory element-binding protein (SREBP) pathway (SCAP,

142

MBTPS1, MBTPS2) (Fig. 1b, Extended Data Fig. 2a) 29. SCAP is an escort protein for the

143

transport of the transcription factors SREBF1 and SREBF2 from the ER to the Golgi in

144

response to low levels of cholesterol. In the Golgi, the SREBF proteins are sequentially

145

cleaved by the proteases MBTPS1 and MBTPS2. Subsequently, the transcription factors

146

translocate to the nucleus to activate fatty acid and cholesterol biosynthesis. SREBF1

147

and SREBF2 themselves did not score in the screen, potentially due to their functional

148

redundancy. LDLR (Low Density Lipoprotein Receptor), important for cholesterol uptake,

149

was also enriched in both the SARS-CoV-2 and the 229E screen, while SCAP was

150

enriched in the OC43 screen (Extended Data Fig. 2a,b). Additionally, NPC1 (Niemann–

151

Pick intracellular cholesterol transporter 1), which facilitates export of cholesterol from the

152

endolysosomal compartment, ranked highly in the 229E screen (Fig. 1c)

153

data indicates a strong link between intracellular cholesterol levels and infection by all

154

three coronavirus.

. Overall, our

155
156

Some genes were found in the OC43 and 229E screens, but not in the SARS-CoV-2

157

screen. For instance, the common cold coronavirus screens showed a strong overlap of

158

genes, which are important for endosome and autophagosome maturation (Fig. 1c,d and

159

Extended Data Fig. 2b). These include the small GTPase Rab7a, components of the

160

HOPS complex (VPS11, VPS16, VPS18, VPS33A), the Ccz1-Mon1 guanosine exchange

161

complex (CCZ1, CCZ1B, C18orf8), the WDR81-WDR91 complex, and other genes

162

related to lysosome and autophagosome function (SPNS1, TOLLIP, TMEM41B,

163

AMBRA1)

164

phosphate receptor (M6PR) and GNPTAB, which are important for proper trafficking of

165

lysosomal enzymes from the trans-Golgi network 38,39. Interestingly, the HOPS complex,

166

cathepsins, GNPTAB and SPNS1 were previously linked to Ebola virus entry, implying

167

similar viral entry strategies 39,40.

168

The absence of endolysosomal factors in the SARS-CoV-2 screen may be explained by

169

the ectopic expression of the cell-surface protease TMPRSS2 in this screen. The

170

cleavage of SARS-CoV-2 spike can occur either at the plasma membrane via TMPRSS2

171

or in endolysosomes through cathepsins. Sufficient TMPRSS2 levels may thus ablate the

172

requirement for cathepsin and other factors linked to endolysosomal activity 11. Consistent

173

with this hypothesis, a CRISPR screen using a SARS-CoV-2 with a spike S1/S2 site

174

deletion, which preferentially uses the endolysosomal entry route, showed strong

175

enrichment in RAB7A, the Ccz1-Mon1 guanosine exchange complex, the HOPS complex

176

and the WDR81-WDR91 complex, similar to the OC43 and 229E screen results 22. This

177

suggests that endolysosomal host factors can be required for infection under certain

178

conditions but may become largely dispensable for SARS-CoV-2, especially in

179

TMPRSS2-expressing cell types. As nasal and lung epithelial cells can express high

180

levels of TMPRSS2

181

CRISPR screen using Huh7.5.1-ACE2-IRES-TMPRSS2 cells may represent rate-limiting

factors that are more physiologically relevant to SARS-CoV-2 infection in vivo than the

183

endolysosomal components found in our other two screens and in other studies.

184
185

The OC43 and 229E screens also uncovered KEAP1, the principal negative regulator of

186

NRF2, whose activation restores cellular redox and protein homeostasis (Fig. 1c,d)

187

Activation of the NRF2 transcriptional program may induce a cellular state that is

188

protective against coronavirus infection. Indeed, NRF2 agonists seem to elicit an antiviral

response as demonstrated in cell culture and were proposed for SARS-CoV-2 treatment

192

In addition to genes that scored in multiple CRISPR screens, we also found genes that

193

were only enriched in one screen. Several genes related to the Golgi apparatus were

194

uncovered only in the 229E screen and may possibly have 229E-specific roles. Among

195

them were GPR89A and GPR89B, which encode two highly homologous G protein

196

coupled receptors important for Golgi acidification 45, and NBAS and USE1, which play a

197

role in Golgi-to-ER retrograde transport 46. The exact role of these factors in coronavirus

198

infection – and their specificity to 229E – remain to be determined.

199
200

The SARS-CoV-2 screen identified multiple subunits of the exocyst (EXOC1-8) (Fig. 1b,

201

Extended Data Fig. 2a), an octameric protein complex that facilitates the tethering of

202

secretory vesicles to the plasma membrane prior to SNARE-mediated fusion

203

complex could therefore facilitate trafficking of virus particles during entry or egress. The

top hit of the SARS-CoV-2 screen was TMEM106B, a poorly characterized lysosomal

TMEM106B caused defects in lysosome trafficking, impaired acidification and reduced

levels of lysosomal enzymes but its precise molecular function remains enigmatic

TMEM106B KO could thus indirectly affect SARS-CoV-2 entry, although it is also possible

Network propagation across multiple CRISPR screens highlights functional biological

clusters important for coronavirus infection

218

To better understand the functional connections between the genes identified in our

219

screens, we performed network propagation (Fig. 2b)

220

datasets using networks, thereby identifying subnetworks and pathways that are common

221

across datasets. Propagations from the three CRISPR screens identified subnetworks

222

most common to all three viruses and independently confirmed the biological processes

223

highlighted as important for coronavirus infection in our previous analysis (Fig. 2c,

224

Extended Data Fig. 3, Supplementary Table 2 and 3). For instance, we found clusters

225

linked to cholesterol metabolism (containing SCAP, MBTPS1, SREBF2, LDLR and

226

NPC1), endosome to lysosome transport (including the HOPS complex components

228

(containing heparan sulfate biosynthesis genes). Another cluster reflected the critical role

229

of autophagy/ phospholipid metabolism and indicated a functional link between VAC14

230

and subunits of the PI3K complex as described above .

231

Moreover, network propagation also identified previously unappreciated biological

232

functions, such as steroid hormone signaling, cell-cell adhesion, metal ion transport, intra-

233

Golgi vesicle transport, snare complex assembly, Rab protein signal transduction,

234

peroxisomal transport and mRNA splicing (Fig. 2c, Extended Data Fig. 3, Supplementary

236

processes that may have critical roles during coronavirus infection.

237
238

Knockout of candidate host factor genes reduces coronavirus replication

239

To validate the candidate genes from the SARS-CoV-2 screen, we generated individual

240

KO cells in two cell types. We first introduced gene deletions for several top hits in A549

241

lung epithelial cells transduced with ACE2 (A549-ACE2) using Cas9 ribonucleoproteins

242

(RNPs) (Extended Data Fig. 4a). SARS-CoV-2 RNA levels were markedly reduced in

243

cells that contained indel mutations in ACE2, the ADP Ribosylation Factor 5 (ARF5),

244

multiple subunits of the exocyst (EXOC2/6/8), the cholesterol homeostasis genes SCAP,

245

MBTPS1 and MBTPS2, the phosphatidylinositol kinase complex components PIKFYVE

246

and VAC14, as well as TMEM106B (Fig. 3a). Additionally, we generated clonal Huh7.5.1

247

cells (without the ACE2-IRES-TMPRSS2 construct) harboring frameshift mutations in a

248

subset of the same genes (Extended Data Fig. 4b). Deletion of TMEM106B and VAC14

249

decreased SARS-CoV-2 replication, and this effect was reversed by cDNA

250

complementation (Fig. 3b,c), thus confirming the role of these two factors in the SARS-

251

CoV-2 life cycle. Similarly, knocking out SCAP, MBTPS2 or EXOC2 led to a decrease of

252

SARS-CoV-2 RNA levels (Fig. 3d). When we infected the same Huh7.5.1 KO cells with

253

HCoV-OC43 and HCoV-229E, we observed reduced viral replication in SCAP and

254

MBTPS2 KO cells, but not in TMEM106B KO and only moderately in VAC14 KO cells

255

(Fig. 3e). This suggests that the latter genes are more rate-limiting in SARS-CoV-2

256

infection.

257
258

Finally, we probed cells lacking several genes involved in endosome maturation or the

259

PI3K complex, which were initially found in the common cold coronavirus screens. We

260

saw reduced viral replication for OC43 and 229E (Fig. 3f,g). Additionally, we observed

261

increased cell viability in all KO cells relative to WT Huh7.5.1 cells 8 dpi, indicating that

262

endosome maturation is important for infection by the common cold viruses and for virus-

263

induced cell death (Extended Data Fig. 4c). Next, we tested whether the hits shared

264

between OC43 and 229E might also affect SARS-CoV-2. Indeed, SARS-CoV-2 infection

265

also depended on endosomal factors in the context of Huh7.5.1 without ACE2-IRES-

266

TMPRSS2, similar to the common cold coronaviruses (Fig. 3h). Additionally, deletions of

267

the PI3K subunits, in particular PIK3R4 KO, led to a strong decrease in replication of all

268

three coronaviruses (Fig. 3h). Together, these experiments confirm that the host factors

269

identified in our screens have functional roles for Coronaviridae and demonstrate that

270

important aspects of SARS-CoV-2 biology can be revealed by studying the common cold

271

coronaviruses.

Compounds directed at host factors inhibit coronavirus replication

275

Host factors important for virus infection are potential targets for antiviral therapy. Host-

276

directed therapy is advantageous as it allows pre-existing drugs to be repurposed, it may

277

provide broad-spectrum inhibition against multiple viruses, and it is generally thought to

278

be more refractory to viral escape mutations than drugs targeting viral factors

279

therefore explored whether the cellular pathways identified in our screens could serve as

280

targets for therapy against coronavirus infection.

282

Given the strong dependence of all three coronaviruses on PIK3R4, we tested SAR405,

283

a selective and ATP-competitive inhibitor of class III PI3K (PIK3C3) 53. The drug exhibited

284

a dose-dependent effect against all three coronaviruses with low cytotoxicity, consistent

285

with the reduced virus replication in PIK3R4 KO cells, and suggesting that it could serve

286

as a pan-coronavirus inhibitor (Fig. 4a). As VAC14, a PIKfyve complex component, was

287

a strong hit in the SARS-CoV-2 screen, we also tested the PIKfyve inhibitor YM201636

288

and observed inhibition of SARS-CoV-2 replication (Fig. 4b)

289

was previously demonstrated with apilimod, another PIKfyve inhibitor 55–57.

two cholesterol modulating compounds also led to a decrease in OC43 and 229E levels,

298

suggesting that modulation of intracellular cholesterol levels could be used as pan-

299

coronavirus treatment (Fig. 4e). Therefore, our genetic and pharmacological data suggest

300

that both phosphatidylinositol kinase complexes and cholesterol homeostasis are

301

potential targets for pan-coronavirus host-directed therapy in vitro and may be explored

302

further in vivo.

304

Discussion

305

In this study, we performed genome-scale CRISPR KO screens to identify host factors

306

important for SARS-CoV-2, HCoV-229E and HCoV-OC43. Our data highlight that while

307

the three coronaviruses exploit distinct entry factors, they also depend on a convergent

308

set of host pathways, with potential roles for the entire Coronaviridae family. In particular,

309

genes involved in cholesterol homeostasis were enriched in all screens and in the network

310

propagation. Consistent with our data, two SARS-CoV-2 interactomes revealed binding

311

of viral proteins to SCAP, and a recent CRISPR screen focused on the interactome

312

components also identified SCAP as a host factor critical for SARS-CoV-2 replication

313

16,17,21

314

regulate SCAP activity and cholesterol levels. Cellular cholesterol homeostasis has

315

previously been linked to viral entry and membrane fusion in the context of bunya- and

316

hantavirus infections, suggesting a pro-viral function across different viral families

317

Consistent with this hypothesis, treatment with 25-hydroxycholesterol, which blocks

318

SREBP processing and stops cholesterol synthesis, reduced infection with SARS-CoV-1

319

and CoV-2 spike-pseudotyped viruses 29,63.

; given the essentiality of SCAP for replication, viral proteins are likely to positively

.

320

Additionally, phosphatidylinositol biosynthesis was uncovered as an important pathway

321

for coronavirus infection. While PIKfyve has previously been implicated through chemical

322

inhibition

323

potentially exhibiting pan-coronavirus function. Due to its involvement in multiple cellular

324

processes including vesicular trafficking and autophagy

325

whether coronaviruses hijack this pathway during entry or for the generation of double-

326

membrane vesicles required for the viral replication/transcription complexes.

55–57

, we identified the upstream PI3K complex as a new critical host factor,

28

, it remains to be determined

327
328

Our results also inform those of a recent drug repurposing screen, which identified ~100

329

compounds that inhibited SARS-CoV-2 replication 64; notably, among those were PIKfyve

330

inhibitors, protease inhibitors and modulators of cholesterol homeostasis. Our functional

331

genomics data therefore suggest that the observed effects of several compounds were

332

possibly due to inhibition of critical host factors.

333
334

In conclusion, our study offers important insight into host pathways commonly hijacked

335

by coronaviruses. Importantly, the identification of the phosphatidylinositol PIK3C3 kinase

336

complex as a potent therapeutic target for SARS-CoV-2 based on the 229E and OC43

337

screens underscores the value of the parallel CRISPR screening approach for finding

338

novel therapies against SARS-CoV-2 and other Coronaviridae.

serial 10-fold dilutions of virus stocks were used to infect cells in 6-well plates for 1h and

495

an overlay of DMEM media containing 1.2% Avicel RC-591 was added. Cells were

496

incubated for 3-4 days, followed by fixation with 10% formaldehyde, staining with crystal

497

violet and plaque counting. Additionally, SARS-CoV-2 stock was sequence-verified by

498

next-generation sequencing. All experiments with OC43 and 229E were performed in a

499

biosafety level 2 laboratory and all experiments involving SARS-CoV-2 were performed

Genome-wide CRISPR screens

504

Huh7.5.1-Cas9 cells were generated by lentiviral transduction with lentiCas9-blast

505

(Addgene, #52962, gift from Feng Zhang) and subsequently selected with blasticidin for

506

7 days. A portion of Huh7.5.1-Cas9 cells were additionally transduced with lentivirus

507

containing ACE2-IRES-TMPRSS2-hygro. To generate CRISPR KO libraries, a total of

508

240 million Huh7.5.1-Cas9-blast or Huh7.5.1-Cas9-blast+ACE2-IRES-TMPRSS2-hygro

509

cells were transduced with lentivirus of the human GeCKO v2 library (Addgene,

510

#1000000049, gift from Feng Zhang) at a moi of 0.4 and subsequently selected using

511

puromycin and expanded for 7 days. A total of 60 million mutagenized cells for each

512

GeCKO sublibrary (A and B) were collected for genomic DNA extraction to assess the

513

sgRNA representation of the starting population. For the SARS-CoV-2 CRISPR host

514

factor screen, 100 million cells of Huh7.5.1-Cas9-blast+ACE2-IRES-TMPRSS2-hygro

515

GeCKO library cells were infected with SARS-CoV-2 at a multiplicity of infection (moi) of

516

0.01. Virus-induced cell death was apparent after 2-3 days and surviving cells were

517

collected 12 dpi. The screen was performed once.

518

For the 229E and OC43 CRISPR screens, 100 million cells (per screen) of Huh7.5.1-

519

Cas9-blast GeCKO library cells were infected with 229E and OC43 at moi of 0.05 and 3,

520

respectively. Cells were incubated at 33C to increase CPE, which was apparent after 3-

521

4 days. Surviving cells were collected after 10 days for 229E and 14 days for OC43. Each

522

screen was performed in two replicates. For all CRISPR screens, genomic DNA (gDNA)

523

was extracted using either QIAamp DNA Blood Maxi Kit (Qiagen) or Quick-DNA Midiprep

524

Plus (Zymo). The sgRNA expression cassettes were amplified from gDNA in a two-step

525

nested PCR using KAPA HiFi HotStart ReadyMixPCR Kit (Kapa Biosystems). For PCR1,

526

40 reactions (for control samples) and 10-16 reactions (for virus selected samples)

527

containing 4 μg gDNA were set up and amplified for 16 cycles. Reactions were pooled,

528

mixed and 200 μl were cleaned up using QIAquick PCR Purification kit (Qiagen). For

529

PCR2, 3 reactions containing 5 μl PCR1 product were amplified for 12 cycles using

530

indexed primers. PCR products were gel purified using QIAquick Gel Extraction Kit

531

(Qiagen) and sequenced on an Illumina NextSeq 500 using a custom sequencing primer.

532

Primers sequences are listed in Supplementary Table 4.

533

Demultiplexed FASTQ files were aligned to a reference table containing sgRNA

534

sequences and abundance of each sgRNA was determined for each starting and selected

535

cell population. Guide count tables were further processed using MaGECK with default

536

“norm-method” to determine positive enrichment scores for each gene

537

OC43, two biological screen replicates were used as input, and for SARS-CoV-2, one

538

biological screen replicate was used. The gene ontology enrichment of the individual

539

screens was run on genes with MaGECK positive score <= 0.005 using the GO Biological

540

Processes of the Molecular Signatures Database (MSigDB).

Network propagation

543

We performed network propagation analysis for the three virus CRISPR screens using

544

the Pathway Commons network

545

analogous to random walk with restart (RWR, also known as insulated diffusion and

546

personalized PageRank) which better captures the local topology of the interaction

547

network compared to a general heat diffusion process. The process is captured by the

548

steady-state solution as follows:

67

. Specifically, we used a heat-diffusion kernel

549

PSS = α(I - (1- α)W)-1P0

550

where PSS represents the vector of propagated values at steady-state, P0 is the initial

551

labeling (genes of interest from molecular studies), W is the normalized version of the

552

adjacency matrix of the underlying network (in this implementation W = AD-1 , where A is

553

the unnormalized adjacency matrix, and D is the diagonal degree matrix of the network),

554

I is the identity matrix, and α denotes the restart probability (here, α=0.2), which is the

555

probability of returning to the previously visited node, thus controlling the spread through

556

the network.

557

We performed three independent propagations, one for each CRISPR dataset (i.e. each

558

virus). After propagation, each propagated network was integrated by multiplying gene-

559

wise. Such an operation is used to create a gene list ranked to prioritize genes with high

560

scores from all propagated datasets. To control for nodes with high degree (i.e. many

561

connections), which due to their heightened connectivity are biased to receive higher

562

propagation scores, we conducted a permutation test. Specifically, we simulated random

563

propagations by shuffling the positive scores to random genes, repeating this 20,000

564

times per CRISPR screen. Next, we calculated an empirical p-value by calculating the

565

fraction of random propagation runs greater than or equal to the true propagation run for

566

each gene.

567

The network was created by extracting a subnetwork from the same Pathway Commons

568

network corresponding to genes possessing a significant p-value (p<=0.01) from the

569

propagation (n=378). Of these, interconnected genes were visualized using Cytoscape

570

(n=284). The resulting network was clustered into subnetworks using the GLay

571

Cytoscape plugin 68. Three large clusters (1, 3, and 5) were further clustered using GLay

into additional subclusters (denoted with letters), resulting in a total of 25 subnetwork

573

clusters (see Extended Data Fig. 3a and Supplementary Table 3). Lastly, Gene Ontology

574

(GO) enrichment analysis (biological process) was performed for each of the 25 resulting

575

subclusters to identify biological processes and pathways associated with each

576

subcluster.

581

(IDT) containing sgRNA sequences were annealed and ligated into pX458 (Addgene,

#48138, gift from Feng Zhang). Cells were transfected with pX458 constructs using Mirus

583

TransIT-X2 (Mirus Bio) and two days later GFP positive cells were single-cell sorted into

584

96-well plates using a Sony SH800 cell sorter. For genotyping, genomic DNA was isolated

585

from obtained clones using DNA QuickExtract (Lucigen), the sgRNA-targeted sites PCR

586

amplified and the products Sanger-sequenced. Obtained sequences were compared to

587

reference sequences and clones containing a frameshift indel or de novo stop codon were

selected. A list of all used sgRNA sequences and genotyping primers can be found in

595

deletions are larger than standard indels generated from single guides. The genomic

596

repair patterns from a multi-guide approach are highly predictable based on the guide-

597

spacing and design constraints to limit off-targets, resulting in a higher probability protein

598

knockout phenotype.

599

RNA oligonucleotides were chemically synthesized on Synthego solid-phase synthesis

600

platform, using CPG solid support containing a universal linker. 5-Benzylthio-1H-tetrazole

601

(BTT, 0.25 M solution in acetonitrile) was used for coupling, (3-((Dimethylamino-

602

methylidene)amino)-3H-1,2,4-dithiazole-3-thione (DDTT, 0.1 M solution in pyridine) was

603

used for thiolation, dichloroacetic acid (DCA, 3% solution in toluene) for used for

604

detritylation. Modified sgRNA were chemically synthesized to contain 2’-O-methyl

605

analogs and 3’ phosphorothioate nucleotide interlinkages in the terminal three nucleotides

606

at both 5’ and 3’ ends of the RNA molecule. After synthesis, oligonucleotides were subject

607

to series of deprotection steps, followed by purification by solid phase extraction (SPE).

608

Purified oligonucleotides were analyzed by ESI-MS.

609

To induce gene knockout, 5 pmol Streptococcus Pyogenes NLS-Sp.Cas9-NLS (SpCas9)

610

nuclease (Aldevron) was combined with 15 pmol total synthetic sgRNA (5 pmol each

611

sgRNA) (Synthego) to form ribonucleoproteins (RNPs) in 20uL total volume with SE

612

Buffer (Lonza). The RNP assembly reaction was mixed by pipetting up and down and

613

incubated at room temperature for 10 minutes.

614

All cells were dissociated into single cells using TrypLE Express (Gibco), as described

615

above, resuspended in culture media and counted. 100,000 cells per nucleofection

619

Nucleofections were performed on a Lonza HT 384-well nucleofector system using

620

program CM-120. Immediately following nucleofection, each reaction was transferred to

621

a tissue-culture treated 96-well plate containing 100µL normal culture media and seeded

622

at a density of 50,000 cells per well.

623

Two days post-nucleofection, DNA was extracted from using DNA QuickExtract

624

(Lucigen). Amplicons for indel analysis were generated by PCR amplification. PCR

625

products were cleaned-up and analyzed by sanger sequencing. Sanger data files and

626

sgRNA target sequences were input into Inference of CRISPR Edits (ICE) analysis

627

(ice.synthego.com) to determine editing efficiency and to quantify generated indels 65. A
