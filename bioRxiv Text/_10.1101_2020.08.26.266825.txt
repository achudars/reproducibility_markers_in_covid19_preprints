Summary

17

Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) has caused a pandemic with millions of

18

infected humans and hundreds of thousands of fatalities. As the novel disease - referred to as COVID-19 -

19

unfolded, occasional anthropozoonotic infections of animals by owners or caretakers were reported in dogs,

20

felid species and farmed mink. Further species were shown to be susceptible under experimental conditions.

21

The extent of natural infections of animals, however, is still largely unknown. Serological methods will be

22

useful tools for tracing SARS-CoV-2 infections in animals once test systems are validated for use in different

23

species. Here, we developed an indirect multi-species ELISA based on the receptor-binding domain (RBD) of

24

SARS-CoV-2. The newly established ELISA was validated using 59 sera of infected or vaccinated animals

25

including ferrets, raccoon dogs, hamsters, rabbits, chickens, cattle and a cat, and a total of 220 antibody-

26

negative sera of the same animal species. Overall, a diagnostic specificity of 100.0% and sensitivity of 98.31%

27

was achieved, and the functionality with every species included in this study could be demonstrated. Hence,

28

a versatile and reliable ELISA protocol was established that enables high-throughput antibody detection in a

29

broad range of animal species, which may be used for outbreak investigations, to assess the seroprevalence

30

in susceptible species or to screen for reservoir or intermediate hosts.

Introduction

35

Since the beginning of 2020, the acute respiratory disease COVID-19 caused by a novel betacoronavirus,

36

severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) (Zhu et al., 2020), has been keeping the world

37

in suspense. COVID-19 emerged for the first time in December 2019 in Wuhan, China (WHO, 2020b), and has

38

developed rapidly into a global pandemic (WHO, 2020a) resulting in millions of infections and hundreds of

39

thousands of deaths. The symptoms in affected humans range from inapparent infections to fever, fatigue,

40

cough, shortness of breath or severe pneumonia and death (WHO, 2020c). SARS-CoV-2 is primarily

41

transmitted between infected humans through droplets and fomites (Ghayda et al., 2020; WHO, 2020c).

42

However, the virus is thought to originate from an animal reservoir, from where it was likely transmitted to

43

humans by either a direct spill-over event presumably followed by natural selection and adaptation in

44

humans, or via an intermediate mammalian host (Andersen, Rambaut, Lipkin, Holmes, & Garry, 2020). As

45

SARS-CoV-2 is highly similar to bat betacoronaviruses (Latinne et al., 2020; Wu et al., 2020; Zhou et al., 2020)

46

or betacoronaviruses found in pangolins (Zhang, Wu, & Zhang, 2020), it is suspected that one of those animal

47

species may represent the original host of the SARS-CoV-2 ancestral virus. Considering the presumed

48

zoonotic origin of SARS-CoV-2 and the fact that highly similar orthologues of the human angiotensin-

49

converting enzyme (ACE2) receptor are present in certain animal species (Li, 2013; Sun, Gu, Ma, & Duan,

50

2020), it is of interest to identify susceptible animal species and to assess SARS-CoV-2 prevalence in these

51

species. As the COVID-19 pandemic unfolded, occasional infections of dogs, domestic and non-domestic felid

52

species (cat, tiger, lion) and farmed minks were reported (Enserink, 2020; McAloose et al., 2020; Oreshkova

53

et al., 2020; Sailleau et al., 2020; Sit et al., 2020; Wang et al., 2020). The majority of SARS-CoV-2-infections in

54

animals were directly linked to SARS-CoV-2-infected owners or animal caretakers. Under experimental

55

conditions, the susceptibility of additional species including ferrets, hamsters, and fruit bats has been

56

demonstrated (Osterrieder et al., 2020; Richard et al., 2020; Schlottau et al., 2020; Shi et al., 2020). However,

57

the level of natural infections is largely unknown. Currently, infection in animals is mostly confirmed by direct

58

virus detection using (real-time) RT-PCRs. While this is highly sensitive and specific, experimental and field

59

data demonstrate that animals test positive only during a very short time interval. Therefore, to elucidate the

60

host range of SARS-CoV-2 and the prevalence in susceptible species serological assays, i.e. multi-species

61

antibody detection systems, could be beneficial. Serum neutralization tests, which are species-independent,

62

rely on in-vitro interaction between the infectious virus and specific antibodies and, therefore, require high-

63

containment laboratories to handle the virus. In contrast, enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays (ELISAs) can

64

be applied under less stringent biosafety conditions, once such test systems are validated for use in animals.

65

In addition, ELISAs enable high-throughput testing of clinical specimens.

66

For human sera, a wide range of ELISA systems have been developed within a very short time based on

67

different antigens that include the viral nucleocapsid (N) protein, the spike protein (S) or the S receptor-

68

binding domain (RBD) (Beavis et al., 2020; Klumpp-Thomas et al., 2020; Tré-Hardy et al., 2020). When

69

comparing different antigens as assay targets, considerable cross-reactivity between different coronaviruses

70

occurred in whole-virus or N-based serological assays, while S or RBD based protocols demonstrated a much

71

higher specificity (Chia et al., 2020; Klumpp-Thomas et al., 2020; Meyer, Drosten, & Müller, 2014). Based on

72

these findings, we selected different domains of the S protein for the development of a multi-species SARS-

73

CoV-2 antibody ELISA to avoid cross-reactivity and associated non-specificity. This is especially important as

74

coronaviruses including several betacoronaviruses are widespread in animals (Amer, 2018; Drechsler,

75

Alcaraz, Bossong, Collisson, & Diniz, 2011; Erles & Brownlie, 2008; Hodnik, Ježek, & Starič, 2020; Murray,

76

Kiupel, & Maes, 2010; Tizard, 2020), and could potentially cross-react in SARS-CoV-2 test systems.

Materials and methods

79

Protein expression and ELISA procedure

80

For expression of the SARS-CoV-2 S1 and the RBD-SD1 domain, amino acids (aa) 17 to 685 or 319 to 519,

81

respectively, were amplified from a codon-optimized synthetic gene (GeneArt synthesis, ThermoFisher

82

Scientific, Germany). The constructs were cloned into the pEXPR103 expression vector (iba lifesciences,

83

Germany) in-frame with an N-terminal modified mouse IgΚ light chain signal peptide and a C-terminal double

84

Strep-tag. Expi293 cells were grown in suspension in Expi293 expression medium (ThermoFisher Scientific) at

85

37 °C, 8 % CO2, and 125 rpm. The cells were transfected using the ExpiFectamine293 transfection kit

86

(ThermoFisher Scientific) according to the manufacturer´s instructions. Five to six days after transfection, the

87

supernatants were harvested by centrifugation at 6000xg for 20 min at 4 °C. Biotin was blocked by adding

88

BioLock (iba lifesciences) as recommended, and the supernatant was purified using Strep-Tactin XT

89

Superflow high capacity resin (iba lifesciences) according to the manufacturer´s instructions. Finally, the

90

proteins were eluted with 50 mM biotin (in 100 mM Tris-HCl, 150 mM NaCl, 1 mM EDTA; pH 8.0). The

91

expression of the proteins was verified by SDS-PAGE and western blotting using a HRP-conjugated anti-Strep-

92

tag antibody (dilution 1/20,000, iba lifesciences). Reactive bands were visualized using the Super Signal West

93

Pico Chemiluminescent substrate (ThermoFisher Scientific) and an Intas ChemoCam system (Intas Science

94

Imaging Instruments GmbH, Germany).

95

For the ELISA, medium-binding plates (Greiner Bio-One GmbH, Germany) were coated with 100 ng/well of

96

either the RBD or S1 antigen overnight at 4 °C in 0.1 M carbonate buffer (1.59 g Na2CO3 and 2.93 g NaHCO3,

97

ad. 1 l aqua dest., pH 9.6), or were treated with the coating buffer only. Thereafter, the plates were blocked

98

for 1 h at 37 °C using 5 % skim milk in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS). To evaluate the optimal

99

concentration, sera were pre-diluted 1/50, 1/100 or 1/200 in Tris-buffered saline with Tween 20 (TBST), and

100

incubated on the coated and uncoated wells for 1 h at room temperature. A multi-species conjugate

101

(SBVMILK; IDvet, France) was diluted 1/40 or 1/80 and then added for 1 h at room temperature. For chicken

102

samples, an anti-chicken conjugate (Rabbit anti-Chicken IgY (H+L) Secondary Antibody, HRP; ThermoFisher

103

Scientific) diluted 1/10,000 was applied. Following the addition of tetramethylbenzidine (TMB) substrate

104

(IDEXX, Switzerland), the ELISA readings were taken at a wavelength of 450 nm on a Tecan Spectra Mini

105

instrument (Tecan Group Ltd, Switzerland). Between each step, the plates were washed three times with

106

TBST. The adsorbance was calculated by subtracting the optical density (OD) measured on the uncoated

107

wells from the values obtained from the protein-coated wells for the respective sample.

108
109

Serum samples

110

A total of 220 animal sera (51 cat, 33 cattle, 32 ferret, 27 raccoon dog, 35 chicken, 30 rabbit, 12 hamster)

111

collected before the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic or representing pre-infection sera of SARS-CoV-2 animal studies

112

were included as negative control samples. The SARS-CoV-2 negative status of the latter was verified by a

113

virus neutralization test (VNT) or in an indirect immunofluorescence assay (iIFA).

114

Eight ferret, 20 hamster, 16 raccoon dog and two cattle SARS-CoV-2 antibody-positive sera originated from

115

experimental infection studies and were collected between 8 and 28 days post infection (dpi) (Freuling et al.,

116

2020; Osterrieder et al., 2020; Schlottau et al., 2020; Ulrich, Wernike, Hoffmann, Mettenleiter, & Beer, 2020;

117

Balkema-Buschmann, Rissmann et al., unpublished). With the exception of the bovine samples, all sera

118

tested positive in a VNT, in an iIFA, or in both, with the iIFA being more sensitive for antibody detection early

119

after infection (Schlottau et al., 2020). The cattle sera were collected 12 and 20 dpi from the same animal.

120

The first sample tested negative by iIFA, while the second showed weak positive signals (titer 1/4). In

121

addition, three sequential sera from a naturally SARS-CoV-2 infected cat were included (ProMED-mail, 2020).

122

The titers of the feline samples as measured by VNT were 1/40 (serum collected 15 days after the first SARS-

123

CoV-2 positive throat swab sample), 1/51 (22 days) and 1/40 (29 days), respectively. Furthermore, sera of

124

three chickens (49 days post prime and 28 days post boost immunization, iIFA positive >1/640) and two

125

rabbits immunized with the RBD and three chickens (49 days post prime and 28 days post boost

126

immunization, iIFA inconclusive) and two rabbits immunized for immuno-serum generation with the S1

127

protein were added.

128
129

Sensitivity, specificity, repeatability and reproducibility

130

To determine the cut-off values and the diagnostic sensitivity and specificity of the final ELISA protocol, the

131

sera were tested, and receiver operating characteristic (ROC) analyses were performed.

132

For evaluation of intra-assay reproducibility, a negative and a very weak-positive cattle serum (collected at

133

12 dpi) as well as a positive raccoon dog serum (16 dpi) were tested in five replicates each. The inter-assay

134

repeatability was determined with the identical samples and replicate numbers on five independent ELISA

135

plates. Mean values and standard deviations of the 25 replicates were calculated. All analyses and

136

visualizations were performed using GraphPad Prism version 8.0 for Windows (GraphPad Software, USA).

137
138

Results and Discussion

139

Both SARS-CoV-2 protein domains, i.e. RBD and S1, were successfully expressed (figure 1), and their

140

functionality was proven by their reactivity with sera from infected or immunized animals (figures 2 and 3).

141

Thereafter, both proteins were compared regarding the optimal conditions for their use as capture antigens

142

in antibody ELISAs. In general, a higher absorption signal was obtained for positive control sera when the

143

RBD domain was coated, independent of the applied serum or conjugate concentration, while S1 as target

144

antigen led to a stronger background signal for negative control samples in every approach (figure 2). It has

145

been reported in previous studies that the RBD domain is the most specific antigen for the detection of SARS-

146

CoV-2 antibodies in humans, predominantly because this region is a major target of antibodies, and, in

147

addition, is poorly conserved between different coronaviruses (Amanat et al., 2020; Chia et al., 2020;

148

Premkumar et al., 2020). Considering the results of the RBD/S1 comparison in this study, the same holds true

149

for animals. Alternatively, the superior performance of the RBD domain might be related to the protein

150

production and purification procedure, a phenomenon that has been already described for SARS-CoV-2

151

proteins (Klumpp-Thomas et al., 2020). While the expression of the RBD is relatively straightforward, the

152

production of the large-size, heavily glycosylated S1 domain is more challenging. Both, expression and

153

purification are inefficient and consequently require pooling of several independently produced batches and

154

more hands-on-time, which might lead to a lower quality of the final protein preparation. Here, we selected

155

the RBD domain for further use because of the stronger specific signal combined with a lower unspecific

156

background signal.

157

When assessing different sample and conjugate concentrations on the RBD-coated plates, an optimized

158

signal-to-noise ratio was achieved by using serum and multi-species conjugate dilutions of 1/100 and 1/80,

159

respectively (figure 2). Hence, all following analyses were carried out using this test setup.

160

In order to evaluate both the sensitivity and specificity of the final test protocol and to establish a threshold

161

for positivity, SARS-CoV-2 antibody-negative and -positive sera of multiple species were tested. ROC curve

162

analyses indicated that the ELISA had a very high diagnostic accuracy with an area under the curve (AUC) of

163

0.989 (95% confidence interval (CI): 0.969 to 1.00). Based on the ROC curve (figure 3A), a cut-off of ≤0.2 for

164

negativity and ≥0.3 for positivity was set, with the intermediate zone between 0.2 and 0.3 being inconclusive.

165

Using these cut-off values, an overall diagnostic specificity of 100.0% (95% CI: 98.34% to 100.0%) and

166

sensitivity of 98.31% (95% CI: 90.91% to 99.96%) was achieved, where the optimal specificity is particularly

167

remarkable, as in some of the animal sera high titers of antibodies against non-SARS beta-coronaviruses

168

were present like bovine coronaviruses (Ulrich, Wernike, Hoffmann, Mettenleiter, & Beer, 2020).

169

Consequently, the previously described high suitability and accuracy of RBD-based antibody detection

170

systems for human coronaviruses (Chia et al., 2020; Meyer et al., 2014) could also be confirmed for different

171

animal species.

172

Regarding the diagnostic sensitivity, every antibody positive serum included in this study could be identified,

173

with only one exception (figure 3C). This was a single putative seropositive sample that was collected from a

174

ferret 12 days after experimental infection, which tested negative by VNT and exhibited a low titer of 1/64 in

175

the iIFA (ferret number 5 described in (Schlottau et al., 2020)). When considering only sera collected later

176

than 12 days after infection, every individual was correctly detected as being antibody-positive, independent

177

of the animal species. Thus, the newly established ELISA protocol enables the antibody detection in a broad

178

range of animal species that are susceptible to SARS-CoV-2, such as ferrets, cats, raccoon dogs, hamsters or

179

cattle. Furthermore, the applicability could be shown for further species like rabbits or chicken (figure 3C),

180

which are frequently used for reagent production for research, diagnostics and therapeutic purposes

181

(Farzaneh, Hassani, Mozdziak, & Baharvand, 2017; Popkov et al., 2003; Rossi et al., 2005). Hence, the

182

versatility was demonstrated for a test system that does not require high-containment laboratories as e.g.

183

species-independent neutralization assays. However, when further species not included in the current

184

validation are to be tested, the test has to be validated including the suitability of the conjugate for the

185

particular species in question. Alternatively, a species-specific conjugate may be used, as shown here for

186

chicken (figure 3).

187

In the final step of the validation, both the repeatability and reproducibility were assessed using five

188

replicates each of three sera in five independent ELISA assays. The negative cattle serum and the positive

189

raccoon dog sample tested correctly in each case with very low variations (figure 3B). Mean OD values and

190

standard deviations of 0.03±0.02 and 0.72±0.07 were calculated for the antibody-negative and -positive

191

sample, respectively. Every replicate of the very weak positive cattle sample tested positive or resulted in the

192

doubtful measuring range of the ELISA (mean 0.28, standard deviation 0.03, min 0.21, max 0.33). Thus, the

193

animal would have been detected as SARS-CoV-2-antibody positive in every approach (figure 3B), further

194

demonstrating the reliability of the test system.

195

In conclusion, we established a versatile ELISA protocol for the highly sensitive and specific detection of

196

SARS-CoV-2 antibodies in animal sera, which could be used for outbreak investigations, monitoring studies or

197

to identify yet unknown reservoir or intermediate hosts.

Figure 2: Optimization of the SARS-CoV-2 ELISA. Three raccoon dog sera that tested positive by an indirect

333

immunofluorescence assay (animal numbers #7, #10 and #11) and three negative sera (#8, #9 and #12) were

334

diluted 1/50, 1/100 or 1/200, and tested in combination with a multi-species conjugate (dilution 1/40 or

335

1/80) against the SARS-CoV-2 RBD-SD1 domain (black bars) or S1 protein (grey bars) expressed in Expi293

repeatability of the ELISA. A negative and a very weak positive cattle serum, as well as a positive sample

341

collected from a raccoon dog were tested in five replicates each in five independent approaches. The box

343

the SARS-CoV-2 ELISA for animal sera from clinical trials. Samples taken on day 8 or 12 after infection are

344

shown by open squares. Sera that were collected from day 15 onwards after an experimental infection

345

(ferret, raccoon dog, cattle, hamster) or immunization (chicken, rabbit), or after the first RT-PCR positive

346

throat swab sample (cat) are indicated by filled squares. Negative control samples are shown by circles. The
