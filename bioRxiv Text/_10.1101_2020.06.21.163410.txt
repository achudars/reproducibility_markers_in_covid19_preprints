ABSTRACT
Novel coronaviruses, including SARS-CoV-2, SARS, and MERS, often originate from
recombination events. The mechanism of recombination in RNA viruses is template switching.
Coronavirus transcription also involves template switching at specific regions, called
transcriptional regulatory sequences (TRS). It is hypothesized but not yet verified that TRS sites
are prone to recombination events. Here, we developed a tool called SuPER to systematically
identify TRS in coronavirus genomes and then investigated whether recombination is more
common at TRS. We ran SuPER on 506 coronavirus genomes and identified 465 TRS-L and
3509 TRS-B. We found that the TRS-L core sequence (CS) and the secondary structure of the
leader sequence are generally conserved within coronavirus genera but different between
genera. By examining the location of recombination breakpoints with respect to TRS-B CS, we
observed that recombination hotspots are more frequently co-located with TRS-B sites than
expected.

INTRODUCTION
In the past two decades, at least three novel coronaviruses have spilled over from animals into
humans, SARS, MERS, and SARS-CoV-2(Cui et al., 2019; Guarner, 2020). Coronaviruses are
positive-sense, single-stranded RNA viruses with large genomes and are grouped into four
genera: Alphacoronaviruses, Betacoronaviruses, Gammacoronaviruses, and
Deltacoronaviruses(Cui et al., 2019). Recombination between coronaviruses plays an important
role in coronavirus evolution and can alter host range, pathogenicity, and transmission
pattern(Bentley and Evans, 2018; Graham et al., 2018; Keck et al., 1988; Lai et al., 1985; Lau et
al., 2010; Tian et al., 2014; Wang et al., 2017, 1993; Xiao et al., 2017; Zhang et al., 2005). Intercoronavirus recombination requires two different but related coronaviruses to co-infect a
cell(Graham et al., 2018; Graham and Baric, 2010; Simon-Loriere and Holmes, 2011).
Recombination in coronaviruses occurs during genome replication when the RNA-dependent
RNA polymerase (RdRp) replicating the genome dissociates from one viral genome currently
serving as the template and reassociates with a different viral genome while retaining the
nascent RNA in a process called template switching(Sawicki and Sawicki, 1998; Simon-Loriere
and Holmes, 2011). Therefore, template switching generates a recombinant RNA originating
from the genomes of two coronaviruses(Bentley and Evans, 2018; Simon-Loriere and Holmes,
2011).
Coronavirus and transcription also involves template switching(Sawicki and Sawicki, 1998).
After a coronavirus infects a cell, it replicates its positive-strand RNA genome into a negative
strand genome with RdRp(Sawicki and Sawicki, 1998). The negative strand genome
subsequently serves as a template for the production of positive-strand genomes and
subgenomic messenger RNAs (sgmRNAs), a set of 3' coterminal RNAs encoding structural
genes(Sawicki and Sawicki, 1998). The sgmRNAs share a common 5' sequence, called a
leader sequence, which is located at the beginning of the coronavirus genome(Zhang et al.,
1994). The leader sequence is added to the 5' end of all sgmRNAs through RdRp template
switching(Sawicki and Sawicki, 2005, 1998). Template switching occurs as RdRp is transcribing
the negative strand and encounters transcriptional regulatory sequences (TRS) preceding each
gene called the body TRS (TRS-B)(Sola et al., 2015). The TRS-B site has a 7-8 bp conserved
core sequence (CS) which is thought to enhance the likelihood of RdRp template switching by
hybridizing with an identical or nearly identical CS in the leader TRS (TRS-L)(Sola et al., 2015;
Zúñiga et al., 2004). The occurrence of this programmed template switching leads to the
generation of sgmRNAs with identical 5' and 3' sequences, but alternative central regions
corresponding to the beginning of each structural ORF(Sawicki et al., 2007; Sawicki and
Sawicki, 2005, 1998; Sola et al., 2015; Wu and Brian, 2007).
Because TRS-B is a signal for RdRp to switch templates, it is reasonable to hypothesize that
recombination events are more likely to occur at or near TRS-B sites(Graham et al., 2018).
Once RdRp has dissociated from the original template after encountering TRS-B, it could
reassociate with a different genome, leading to recombination. Identical or nearly identical TRS
sites between different coronaviruses could hybridize promoting recombination at TRS-B sites.
Therefore, in this study we investigate the relationship between genome recombination in

coronaviruses and template switching at TRS-B sites. TRS-B sites are not annotated in every
coronavirus genome because there is not a systematic tool to identify them nor has there been
a project focused on TRS-B annotation. Therefore, there has not been a systematic study of
whether recombination events are more common around TRS-B sites. Thus, we developed a
tool called SuPER to systematically identify TRS sites within coronavirus genomes to better
understand the relationship between coronavirus recombination and template switching. After
systematically identifying TRS sites and recombination events in coronaviruses, we found that 8
of 91 (8.7%) of TRS-B sites are within breakpoint hotspots and that recombination hotspots are
more frequently co-located with TRS-B sites than expected.

RESULTS
Systematic identification of TRS in coronavirus genomes
To examine how template switching at TRS-B sites contributes to genome recombination in
coronaviruses, we needed to systematically identify TRS-B sites. Therefore, we developed the
tool SuPER to identify TRS-B sites in coronavirus genomes (Figure 1A). SuPER first uses a
covariance model derived from Rfam to identify TRS-L via profile-based sequence and structure
scoring. Then, SuPER identifies TRS-B sites either by identifying template switching junctions
with RNA-seq or in the absence of RNA-seq by identifying sequences preceding genes that are
similar to the TRS-L CS as putative TRS-B CS.
To validate SuPER, we ran it on the SARS and SARS-CoV-2 genomes. The TRS-L/B of SARS
and SARS-CoV-2 can be identified or inferred from previous research (Kim et al., 2020; Rota,
2003). We found that when using SuPER with RNA-seq data, we can correctly identify all known
TRS-B sites from these two genomes with zero false positives (STable 1). When running
SuPER without RNA-seq data, if only high confidence TRS-B sites are reported, SuPER can
predict all known 16 TRS-B CS accurately and precisely. SuPER also reports six extra TRS-B
but labeles them as “not recommended” due to the fact that their hamming distance to TRS-L
CS is more than 1 base pair. The reason we still report low confidence TRS-B is due to the
concern of missing potential non-canonical TRS-B CS.
To systematically identify TRS-B in coronaviruses, we used a set of 506 non-redundant
representative genomes from the family Coronaviridae (STable1; See methods). Not all
coronavirus genomes were assigned to a subgenus in the NCBI Virus database. To place the
unassigned genomes into genera and subgenera, we built a phylogenetic tree based on the
RdRp protein sequence(Wolf et al., 2018) from all representative genomes (Figure 1B). In total,
we assigned 498 genomes into 23 subgenera (STable 2). We identified putative TRS-L and
TRS-B CS in the 506 coronavirus genomes with SuPER. Of those, SuPER was run on 11
genomes with RNA-seq data and the remaining genomes without RNA-seq data (STable 3 and
STable 4). In total, SuPER identified 465 TRS-L and 3509 TRS-B.

TRS characterization in coronavirus genomes
Using the results from SuPER, we examined the conservation of TRS-L CS and its position in
the secondary structure in all coronavirus subgenera (Figure 2A). In general, we found that the
TRS-L CS is conserved within genera but differs between genera, with the exception of
Embecoviruses where the TRS-L CS is similar to Alphacoronaviruses. The secondary structure
of the leader sequences were visualized by VARNA(Darty et al., 2009) (SFigure 1). We
observed that the secondary structure of the leader sequence is relatively conserved within
subgenera, but different between subgenera.
We examined the TRS-B CS detected from coronavirus genomes where RNA-seq was
available using SuPER. RNA-seq data can help to identify the template switching patterns and
accurately detect the TRS-B CS. We found that TRS-B CS were either identical to TRS-L CS
from the same genome, or differed by only one base pair in most genomes including SARSCoV-2, SARS, MERS, SADS-CoV and HCoV-HKU1 (Figure 2B). However, in some cases,
there is limited similarity between TRS-L and TRS-B, making it difficult to identify TRS-B without
RNA-seq data. For example, in Porcine Epidemic Diarrhea Virus, the TRS-B CS can differ by
more than two base pairs from the TRS-L CS (Figure 2C). We also observed similarity in a few
base pairs upstream and downstream of the CS, which could be critical for mediating basepairing during template switching in cases where the TRS-L and TRS-B CS differ (Figure
2B)(Sola et al., 2005).
Not all annotated ORFs preceded by TRS-B sites are supported by RNA-seq data. This could
be due to the lack of enough coverage to detect the template switching events occurring at that
position or there is low or no template switching. For example, we did not find RNA-seq data
supporting the TRS-B site proceeding ORF7b and ORF10 with SuPER, and a previous study
using Oxford Nanopore direct RNA sequencing was unable to validate the existence of a
sgmRNA corresponding to ORF7b and ORF10(Kim et al., 2020).

Detecting recombination in coronaviruses
We performed recombination analysis on the genomes for each subgenus using RDP4(Martin
et al., 2015). We chose the subgenus level due to the fact that genomes from different
subgenera often share less than 50% nucleotide identity leading to poor alignments, causing
issues for recombination detection. By building phylogenetic trees from RdRp and the structural
genes S, E, M, and N from Betacoronaviruses, we found that each subgenus formed a distinct
clade for RdRp and the structural genes, providing no evidence of recent inter-subgenus
recombination (Figure 3A). On the contrary, we found conflicting branching orders and
incongruent topology of the subgenera phylogenies suggesting recombination events within
subgenera. In total, we detected 973 recombination events in 16 subgenera with RDP4 (SData
1). The number of recombination events detected is largely dependent on the number and
diversity of representative genomes available for each subgenus.

Analyzing recombination in SARS-CoV-2 and its close relatives
Due to the critical importance of understanding SARS-CoV-2 genome evolution, we performed a
focused analysis on recombination in SARS-CoV-2 and its close relatives with SIMPLOT(Lole et
al., 1999). The sequence identity of the bat coronavirus RATG13, is higher to SARS-CoV-2 than
to the pangelin-derived coronaviruses MP789 and PCoV-GX_PL5 across the entire SARS-CoV2 genome. The bat-derived coronavirus RmYN02 sequence identity is higher to SARS-CoV-2
than RATG13 over the majority of its length except for the region around S and ORF8 where the
identity is lower. In fact, the sequence identity of RmYN02 across S and ORF8 is even lower
than found in the pangolin coronaviruses MP789 and PCoV-GX_PL5. The decreased sequence
identity of RmYN02 across S and ORF8 suggests recombination in these regions (relative to
NC_045512:21259-24264 and NC_045512:27882-28259) (Figure 3B). The coronavirus
CoVZC45, which was isolated from a bat in 2017, has a higher sequence identity to SARS-CoV2 across its genome compared to SARS, except in the region corresponding to the majority of
ORF1b (relative to NC_045512:11726-20372) (Figure 3C). These results suggest recombination
occurred between the ancestors of SARS and SARS-CoV-2, implying the potential for
recombination between SARS and SARS-CoV-2.

TRS-B CS are more likely to be located in a breakpoint hotspot than in a
random position in the genome
After locating TRS-B sites with SuPER, and systematically identifying recombination with RDP4,
we investigated whether recombination is common at TRS-B sites. We determined whether
TRS-B sites are located within a breakpoint hotspot, which is defined here as a region with
breakpoint frequency higher than the 99th percentile of expected recombination breakpoint
clustering assuming random recombination. We identified TRS-B sites from five subgenera
located within recombination hotspots (Figure 4 and SFigure 2). In total, 8 out of 91 identified
TRS-B sites were located within breakpoint hotspots. The recombination hotspots observed are
more frequently co-located with TRS-B sites than expected (2-sample test for equality of
proportions without continuity correction: p=2.2e-07). Interestingly, four of the eight TRS-B sites
located within breakpoint hotspots proceed ORF S, an important determinant of host range. Two
of the eight TRS-B sites located within breakpoint hotspots are found within Sarbecoviruses,
one before ORF8 and one before gene N.

DISCUSSION
Here, we sought to test the hypothesis that template switching at TRS-B sites during genome
replication contributes to coronavirus genome recombination. SuPER, the tool we developed for
identifying TRS sites in coronavirus genomes, will help to unravel this hypothesis. It should be
noted that SuPER performs best given high-coverage RNA-seq data. While it still can predict
TRS sites without RNA-seq, its performance declines and there are some instances, such as in
Pedacovirus, where TRS sites cannot be reliably identified.
While the contribution of genome recombination generated at TRS-B sites can be difficult to
dissect, we found that at 8 of 91 of TRS-B sites are located in breakpoint hotspots. However,

bioRxiv preprint doi: https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.06.21.163410; this version posted June 21, 2020. The copyright holder for this preprint

this is likely an underestimate because our analysis is dependent on the number and diversity of
available coronavirus genomes, and as of now, many coronavirus subgenera have only a
handful of genomes available. We must also take into account the role of selection, in that only
recombination events that produce viable viral genomes will survive and therefore be
sequenced. For example, TRS-B sites tend to be intergenic, so recombination events that
happen there are more likely to be viable, which could be an alternate explanation to the pattern
we observe. As more coronavirus genomes are sequenced in the wake of the COVID-19
pandemic, the contribution of TRS-B sites to coronavirus genome recombination can be
revisited. Experiments that examine recombination due to template switching at TRS-B sites
that lessen the influence of selection pressure, such as direct RNA sequencing with Oxford
Nanopore on cells co-infected with two coronaviruses, could further test this hypothesis. Overall,
these results support but do not definitively confirm that recombinations at TRS-B due to
template switching contribute to coronavirus genome recombination.
The worldwide pandemic caused by SARS-CoV-2 will likely lead to a global reservoir of SARSCoV-2, as transmission to animals such as cats(Halfmann et al., 2020) and minks(Oreshkova et
al., 2020) has been documented. A global reservoir of SARS-CoV-2 dramatically increases the
chances that SARS-CoV-2 could recombine with other coronaviruses leading to recombinant
viruses to which SARS-CoV-2 vaccines do not confer immunity. Furthermore, attenuated
coronaviruses used for vaccines could revert to a virulent phenotype through
recombination(Almazán et al., 2013; Graham et al., 2018; Pascual-Iglesias et al., 2019).
Therefore, it is of critical importance to understand factors and mechanisms that contribute to
and underlie coronavirus genome recombination. Our results contribute to this through the
systematic annotation of TRS sites in coronaviruses, which helps to inform which coronaviruses
are at the highest risk of recombining with SARS-CoV-2 through TRS-B mediated template
switching. Though we are limited by the number of available coronavirus genomes, we did not
observe evidence for recombination between species in the subgenus Sarbecovirus and
species in other Betacoronavirus subgenera or Alpha, Gamma, or Deltacoronaviruses. These
results support that recombination between SARS-CoV-2 and other Sarbecoviruses is more
likely and therefore, Sarbecoviruses should be the subject of intense surveillance. Overall, this
work helps to inform and predict coronavirus genome recombination and could play a small but
important role in preventing future coronavirus outbreaks.

METHODS
Identifying non-redundant coronavirus genomes
We downloaded 5517 complete genomes from the family of Coronaviridae from NCBI Virus
(2020-05-19) and added one additional genome (EPI_ISL_412977 RmYN02) (Zhou et al., 2020)
from GISAID. To remove the redundancy of the genomes, we used Mash(Ondov et al., 2016) to
compute pairwise distance between the genomes (-d 0.01) and cluster them with MCL. We
identified 506 clusters and selected one genome to represent each cluster(Shu and McCauley,
2017).

Phylogenetic analysis
Protein sequences of RdRp, S, M, E, and N genes were retrieved and from each of the 506
representative genomes. Multiple sequence alignment was performed using Muscle(Edgar,
2004) with default parameters and phylogenetic trees built by FastTree from the alignment(Price
et al., 2009). The phylogenetic tree based on RdRp was built to assign the taxonomy for those
genomes without genus and subgenus assignments in NCBI Virus.

Putative recombination events detection and analysis
Representative genomes from the same subgenera were aligned with Muscle(Edgar, 2004) and
then used for RDP4(Martin et al., 2015) to detect recombination events. The GENECONV,
MAXCHI, CHIMAERA, BOOTSCAN, SISCAN and 3SEQ methods implemented in the RDP4
package were used. Default RDP4 settings were used throughout the analysis. Events detected
by four or more of the above methods were accepted and reported. Recombination density
plots and hot-cold spots were identified using the RDP4 package. SIMPLOT(Lole et al., 1999)
was employed to manually detect recombination events in the Sarbecovirus using a “query vs
reference sequence” approach.

Subgenomic mRNA Position Exploration with RNA-seq (SuPER)
SuPER (Subgenomic mRNA Position Exploration by RNA-seq) is designed to detect TRS sites
in coronavirus genomes allowing for the delineation of sgmRNAs start sites. SuPER can be
downloaded from: https://github.com/YiyanYang0728/SuPER. SuPER can use RNA-seq data
to precisely delineate sgmRNA start sites and in the absence of RNA-seq, it uses the TRS-L site
to predict TRS-B sites. The workflow of SuPER is divided into seven steps: 1) infer TRS-L in the
5’ UTR of reference genomes; 2) find split reads in the alignment of the RNA-seq to the
coronavirus genome; 3) detect split sites supported by split reads as potential sgmRNA start
sites; 4) refine assigned positions by identifying TRS-B in the reference genome; 5) associate
the refined positions with possible downstream ORFs (<100 bp) if the genome annotation file is
provided; 6) reconstruct site-specific 5’ end sgmRNA consensus sequences with split reads; 7)
Report the alignment of TRS-L, TRS-B and the 5’ sgmRNA sequences.

Detection of TRS-L in reference genomes
The curated Stockholm file containing 5’ UTR alignment and consensus RNA secondary
structure of major genera of Coronaviridae (namely Alphacoronavirus, Betacoronavirus,
Gammacoronavirus, Deltacoronavirus) was downloaded from the Rfam database
(http://rfam.xfam.org/covid-19), from which the CM files were generated by Infernal(Nawrocki
and Eddy, 2013) with commands “cmbuild” and “cmcalibrate”. Given a reference genome and
genus label, the first 150 bp of the genome was aligned using the corresponding genus CM file
with command “cmalign” in Infernal. According to the consensus motif previously marked
between SL2 and SL4 (often on SL3 if available) in the secondary structure, the counterpart
sequence in the genome was eventually determined as its TRS-L.

Identifying sgmRNA start sites using RNA-seq
SuPER can use RNA-seq data to precisely detect TRS-B sites, which occur at the beginning of
a sgmRNA. If the sequence mapping was obtained by a program using a similar algorithm to
BWA(Li and Durbin, 2009), SuPER will find the split reads mapped both onto the leader
sequence (within the first 10-150 bp in genome) and the sgmRNA 5' end (between the
coordinates 20000 and the end of the genome) on the same strand. On the other hand, if the
sequence alignment is derived from reads mapped by a program considering RNA splicing such
as HISAT2(Kim et al., 2015), SuPER will use junction reads instead. The split or junction reads
then define a putative sgmRNA start site. The putative sgmRNA start site is further refined by
searching for the TRS-B sequence. The region spanning 30bp upstream and downstream of the
putative sgmRNA start site is searched with a sliding window with the same length as TRS-L.
The sequence with minimal hamming distance from TRS-L is assigned as the TRS-B site. In
addition, if a genome annotation file is provided, SuPER will try to connect the sgmRNA start
site to the nearest downstream ORF within 170 bp.

Identifying sgmRNA start sites without RNA-seq
Although the best results are obtained when using RNA-seq, SuPER still functions when only a
reference genome and annotation are provided. After inferring the TRS-L site in the reference
genome, SuPER is capable of finding possible TRS-B sites throughout the whole genome with a
hamming distance from TRS-L less than 1 or less than 2 if a downstream ORF exists. In the
situation of multiple positions associated with the same ORF, the position with minimal hamming
distance and closest to the ORF is assigned as the TRS-B site.

Figure 3: A. Tanglegrams illustrate phylogenetic incongruence in Betacoronaviruses. The
phylogenetic tree built from the RdRp of Betacoronaviruses is on the left and the phylogenetic
tree built from the S, E, M, and N genes is on the right for each tanglegram plot. A line connects
genes from the same species. Species from the same subgenus are colored the same. Red:
Sarbecovirus; orange: Hibecovirus; purple: Nobecovirus; green: Merbecovirus; blue:
Embecovirus. B and C. Simplot analysis performed with Kimura (2-parameter), a window size of
1000 bp and a step size of 50 bp. The query genome for panel B is SARS-CoV-2 (accession
number: NC_045512) and the query genome for panel C is Bat SL-CoVZC45 (accession
number: MG772933). Recombinant regions detected with RDP4 are highlighted light grey.

Figure 4: Recombination breakpoint density plot in Sarbecoviruses. Recombination breakpoint
density plot illustrating breakpoint positions detected across 123 detectable events in
Sarbecovirus using SARS-CoV-2 as the reference. Genes were plotted at the top of the panel
as arrows. All detectable unique breakpoint positions are indicated by small vertical blue lines at
the top of the graph. The number of breakpoints detected within the 200-bp region was counted
d
and plotted as a solid black line. Light and dark grey areas respectively indicate the 95% and
es
99% intervals of expected breakpoint events assuming random recombination. Dashed red lines
indicate the positions of TRS-B and red stars plotted at the red line to indicate that the TRS-B
are located within breakpoint hotspots.
