Abstract
As the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), caused by the severe acute respiratory syndrome
coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2), rages across the world, killing hundreds of thousands and infecting
millions, researchers are racing against time to elucidate the viral genome. Some Bangladeshi institutes
are also in this race, sequenced a few isolates of the virus collected from Bangladesh. Here, we present a
genomic analysis of 14 isolates. The analysis revealed that SARS-CoV-2 isolates sequenced from Dhaka
and Chittagong were the lineage of Europe and the Middle East, respectively. Our analysis identified a
total of 42 mutations, including three large deletions, half of which were synonymous. Most of the
missense mutations in Bangladeshi isolates found to have weak effects on the pathogenesis. Some
mutations may lead the virus to be less pathogenic than the other countries. Molecular docking analysis
to evaluate the effect of the mutations on the interaction between the viral spike proteins and the human
ACE2 receptor, though no significant interaction was observed. This study provides some preliminary
insights into the origin of Bangladeshi SARS-CoV-2 isolates, mutation spectrum and its possible
pathomechanism, which may give an essential clue for designing therapeutics and management of
COVID-19 in Bangladesh.

Introduction

2

The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is an infectious disease caused by severe acute respiratory

3

syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). Common symptoms of the disease include fever, cough, fatigue,

4

shortness of breath, nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea. The disease has emerged as a critical, rapidly

5

evolving global health crisis [1-3]. More than 6.5 million people have contracted the virus, and nearly 400

6

thousand have died [4, 5]. In Bangladesh, the COVID-19 was first reported on 7 March by the Institute of

7

Epidemiology Disease Control and Research (IEDCR) [6]. Until the end of March, the infection rate was

8

sort of low; however, as the non-therapeutic prevention measures enforced by the government faced

9

enormous challenges, the infection rate raised drastically in April and kept on rising [7]. The people did

10

not maintain the social distancing enforced by the government and trend to gather in crowded places [8].

11

Moreover, an inadequacy of testing for COVID-19 diagnosis is a common criticism in Bangladesh [9]. As

12

of 5 June 2020, nearly 65 thousand confirmed cases were reported, with a total of 846 deaths in

13

Bangladesh [10].

14

SARS-CoV-2 is a positive-stranded RNA virus with a genome of ~ 30kb, encodes structural and non-

15

structural proteins. Like other RNA viruses, the SARS-CoV-2 is prone to frequent mutations, which makes

16

it challenging to develop therapeutics and vaccines against the virus [11, 12]. Sequence information of

17

both the pathogen and the host would greatly facilitate an effective therapeutic strategy or vaccine

18

development [13]. Analysis of the genome sequences obtained from a vast array of isolates collected

19

from different regions could provide an idea about the efficacy of the vaccines being developed [14].

20

Henceforth, researchers across the world are running against time to unravel the genomic insights into

21

the virus.

22

Till 2 June 2020, some thirty-five thousand genome sequences of SARS-CoV-2 has been submitted from

23

different countries, where most of the sequence have come from European countries (~20000). About

24

7000 complete genome sequences have been submitted from the USA while China has submitted ~850

25

genome sequences. In Bangladesh, 16 isolates of the virus have been sequenced and deposited in

26

GSAID (Global Initiative on Sharing Avian Influenza Data) database till 20th May 2020. Unfortunately,

27

there is yet a study on the genomics of the SARS-CoV-2 in Bangladeshi isolates.

28

This study aimed to provide some preliminary insights into the genetic structure of all isolates reported in

29

Bangladesh along with the mutational spectrum. It presents the first study on SARS-CoV-2 genomes

30

obtained from Bangladesh, which, in broader terms, would help the therapeutic strategy development and

31

vaccination programs against the virus in the country.

Materials and Methods

35

Retrieval of the SARS-CoV-2 Genome Sequences

36

Till 20th May, genome sequence of 16 Bangladeshi SARS-CoV-2 isolates were found deposited in the

37

GSAID, however genome sequence of 2 isolates were found incomplete. Thus, all 14 complete genome

38

sequences of the reported isolates of SARS-CoV-2 in Bangladesh were retrieved from the GISAID

39

database (https://www.gisaid.org/).

40

outbreak mainly from China, India, Saudi Arabia, Spain, Italy, Japan, Qatar, Canada, Kuwait, USA,

41

France, Sweden, and Switzerland, the first deposited genome sequence of those countries were also

42

retrieved. Sequence information of the first isolate collected from China was considered as a reference for

43

further analysis.

44

Identification of Nucleotide Variations in Bangladeshi Strain

45

We performed multiple sequence alignment using Clustal Omega [15, 16], and the sequence of the strain

46

China [EPI_ISL_402124 ] was used as a reference genome. The alignment file was analyzed using

47

MVIEW program of Clustal Omega [17]. Only variations in the coding regions were analyzed in this study.

48

Prediction of Viral Genome and Identification of Selected Genes

49

FGENESV

50

chain-based viral gene prediction tools, was adopted for the prediction of the genes as well as the

51

proteins from the viral genomes. Each predicted protein (for each viral genomes) was identified using the

52

Basic Local Alignment Search Tool (BLAST), at the interface of the National Center for Biotechnology

53

Information (NCBI). The identity of each protein was evaluated compared to the proteins of the reference

54

strain [18].

55

Detection of Mutation Spectrum

56

Again, Clustal Omega was used for the multiple sequence alignment of each protein, which further

57

analyzed by MVIEW. The amino acid variations were identified in each protein comparing to the protein of

58

the reference strain. Further, both nucleotide variations and amino acid variations were compared to

59

study the types of mutations.

60

Prediction of Mutational Effects

61

The structural and functional effects of the missense variants, along with the stability change, were

62

analyzed using different prediction tools. I-mutant was employed to analyze the stability change where all

As many of the Bangladeshi people return during the COVID-19

of SoftBerry (http://linux1.softberry.com/berry.phtml), which is a Trained Pattern/Markov

63

the parameters were kept in default [19]. Additionally, Mutpred2 was adopted to predict the molecular

64

consequences and functional effect of these mutations [20].

65

Homology Modeling of Spike Proteins and Validation

66

The BLASTp program at the NCBI interface (link) was used to find the most suitable template for

67

homology modeling. Blasting against the protein databank reservoir (PDB) identified spike protein

68

(Human) with PDB ID: 6VSB as a suitable template, as it has 99.59% sequence similarity and 94%

69

coverage with the target sequence. The homology modeling of all mutant spike proteins along with the

70

spike protein of the reference was done using SWISS-MODEL [21]. The validation of the predicted model

71

was done by adopting Rampage and ERRAT [22, 23].

72

Molecular Docking of Spike Protein with ACE2 Receptor

73

The molecular docking approach was employed to investigate the interaction of mutant spike protein with

74

the human ACE2 receptor. First, the crystal structure of human ACE2 (PDB ID 6D0G) was obtained from

75

Protein Data Bank, and PyMOL was used to clean the structure to remove all the complex molecules and

76

water [24, 25]. The HDOCK webserver was used for prediction of the interaction between Spike protein

77

and human ACE2 receptor through the protein-protein molecular docking [26]. PyMOL was also used for

78

the visualization of docking interactions.

79

Results

80

Retrieved Genome Sequence of the SARS-CoV-2

81

A total number of 14 complete genome sequences of the SARS-CoV-2 isolates from Bangladesh and 12

82

genome sequence from the isolates of other countries (China, India, Saudi Arabia, Spain, Italy, Japan,

83

Qatar, Canada, Kuwait, USA, France, Sweden, and Switzerland) have been retrieved from GSAID. The

84

strain of Wuhan accession number with EPI_ISL_402124 was considered as the reference strain.

85

Phylogenetic Tree Analysis

86

Phylogenetic tree analysis revealed that all the selected Bangladeshi isolates could be divided into two

87

main groups, where one group shared a common ancestor with Saudi Arabia (Fig 1). The other group

88

found to have a similarity with the strain from Switzerland, and it could be subdivided into two groups. In

89

one subdivision, four isolates clustered with the strain from Spain, while the other group consisted only of

90

the three Bangladeshi isolates. All the Bangladeshi isolates centered and shared a common ancestor with

91

India and the USA.

93

Predictions of the Genes and Proteins

94

FGENESV predicted the presence of 12 genes in the reference. Interestingly, all except five isolates

95

(EPI_ISL_445213, EPI_ISL_445214, EPI_ISL_450342, EPI_ISL_450343, and EPI_ISL_450344) of

96

Bangladesh also showed a similar result. Both isolates EPI_ISL_445213 and EPI_ISL_445217 found to

97

have ten genes (missing of ORF7a and ORF10 genes) and isolate EPI_ISL_450343 and

98

EPI_ISL_450344 have 11 genes (missing ORF8 gene). Multiple sequence alignment revealed that most

99

of the variation in Bangladeshi isolates occurred in the ORF1a polyprotein, surface glycoproteins, and

100

nucleocapsid phosphoprotein. Remarkably, envelope glycoprotein, ORF6, ORF8, and ORF10 were found

101

100% identical in most of the isolates compared to the reference sequence (Table 1).

102

Mutation Spectrum of Bangladeshi SARS-CoV-2 isolates

103

Analysis of all 14 Bangladeshi isolates revealed a total of 42 single nucleotide variants (Fig 2); 24 of them

104

were nonsynonymous missense in character. Besides, three large deletions were also found in those

105

isolates (Table 2). Among the deletions, two deletions were responsible for the deletion of ORF7a in

106

EPI_ISL_445213 and EPI_ISL_445217 isolates. Another large deletion from nucleotide 27911 to 28254,

107

occurred in EPI_ISL_450343 and EPI_ISL_450344 isolates, responsible for the deletion of ORF8 in both

108

isolates. Surprisingly, three consecutive mutations were found at nucleotide position 28882 to 28884;

109

resulted in two amino acids substitution in nucleocapsid phosphoprotein.

110

Mutational Effects

111

Mutational effects analysis of the 24 missense mutations found that 18 mutations were responsible for

112

decreasing structural stability. Mutations located in the ORF1a polyprotein and surface glycoprotein were

113

predicted to decrease the structural stability of both proteins (Table 3). Additionally, three mutations

114

occurring in surface glycoprotein, ORF3a and ORF6 were predicted to alter the molecular consequences,

115

including loss of sulfation in surface glycoprotein and loss of proteolytic cleavage in ORF3a and loss of

116

allosteric site in ORF6 (Table 4 and Supplementary Table 1).

117

Prediction and Validation of the Homology Models

118

In total, three models were generated using the template PDB ID: 6VSB; one model for the spike protein

119

of reference strain, and the two others were for two different mutant isolates from Bangladesh (Fig 3).

120

Two types of mutations were found in the spike proteins of all Bangladeshi isolates, where most of the

121

isolates were found to contain a substitution of D623G. Only one strain, EPI_ISL_445214, found to have

122

two substitutions; one was similar to the previous substitution, and the other was F1118L. The validation

123

assessment scores of these three models were mostly similar to the template, which provided the

124

reliability of these models (Table 5).

125

Analysis of the Interaction Between Spike Proteins and Human ACE2 Receptor

126

HDOCK server was used to predict the interaction between the above-mentioned 3D models of reference

127

spike proteins along with mutant models and the human ACE2 receptor. Interestingly, this molecular

128

docking analysis revealed that the docking score for the three models against the human ACE2 receptor

129

was similar, and it was -244.42; mutation in the spike proteins do not hamper binding with ACE2 receptor.

130

For three spike protein models, this study found that a domain of spike protein instead of whole protein,

131

amino acid ranging from 345 to 527, was involved in the interactions. This domain was conserved in all

132

isolates resulting in similar interactions with ACE2 (Fig 4).

133

Discussion

134

COVID-19 has become a global challenge for the scientific communities affecting millions of people and

135

taking thousands of lives every day. Scientists worldwide are working hard to combat against SARS-CoV-

136

2, but no significant outcome is obtained [27, 28]. Along with other studies, genetic studies can give a

137

significant clue to understanding the pathogenesis of COVID-19. Together with the critical therapeutic

138

target, the genomic sequence data may provide insights into the pattern of global spread, the diversity

139

during the epidemics, and the dynamics of evolutions, which are crucial to unwind the molecular

140

mechanism of COVID-19 [29]. This study gives insights into the transmission of SARS-CoV-2, genetic

141

diversity of the isolates, and predicts the impacts of mutations in Bangladesh.

142

It has been reported that, during the COVID-19 outbreak about 600000 people had entered into

143

Bangladesh from the other coutries including Italy and Sapin [30].The phylogenetic study revealed that

144

the Bangladeshi isolates found in Dhaka were descendent from Europe, and most of the isolates from

145

Chittagong are descendent from the Middle East. However, two isolates of Chittagong were close to the

146

isolates from Dhaka. Dhaka is the capital city of Bangladesh and the sixth most densely populated city in

147

the world. This virus may spread to other regions of the country from this city as it is the central hub of

148

Bangladesh for financial, political, entertainment, and education. The SARS-CoV-2 isolates collected from

149

Chittagong are close the the isolates from the Middle East is not surprising. As most of the migrants from

150

Bangladesh live in Middle East are from Chittagong, and during the COVID-19 outbreak thousands of

151

them returned to their home city [31, 32].

152

Mutation in the viral genome is a ubiquitous phenomenon for the viruses to escape the host defense. But

153

the mutation rate in SARS-CoV-2 much lower than the other RNA viruses, including seasonal flu viruses

154

[33]. In this study, there was found some variations in the SARS-CoV-2 isolated in Bangladesh, which

155

may affect the epidemiology and pathogenicity of the virus. A total of 42 mutations were identified with a

156

large deletion in the coding regions, where about half were synonymous. Even some isolates found not to

157

encode one or more accessory proteins such as ORF7a, ORF8, and ORF10 caused by a large deletion in

bioRxiv preprint doi: https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.06.07.138800; this version posted June 7, 2020. The copyright holder for this preprint (which

158

the genome. Absent of these accessory proteins may have adverse effects on the viral replication or

159

pathogenesis and the expression of structural protein E [34].

160

Moreover, ORF8 is involved in the crucial adaptation pathways of coronavirus from human-to-human. At

161

the same time, ORF7a contributes to the viral pathogenesis in the host by inhibiting Bone marrow stromal

162

antigen 2 (BST-2), which restricts the release of coronaviruses from affected cells. Loss of ORF7a causes

163

a much more significant restriction of the virus's spreading into the host [35, 36]. Loss of these accessory

164

proteins may lead to the virus being less pathogenic, resulting in a meager infection rate and mortality

165

compared to the other countries [34].

166

Additionally, many variations in structural and non-structural proteins caused substitutions of one or more

167

amino acids were found in the isolates of Bangladesh compared to the reference. Most of the mutations

168

found to affect the structural stability of the proteins rather than alter the molecular functions. Among the

169

structural proteins, most variations were found in Surface glycoproteins (spike) and Nucleocapsid

170

phosphoprotein. Spike proteins play a crucial role in the viral entry into the cell by interacting with the

171

human ACE2 receptor. At the same time, Nucleocapsid phosphoprotein is essential for the packaging of

172

viral genomes into a helical ribonucleocapsid (RNP) and fundamental for viral self-assembly [37, 38].

173

These functions may not affect much by those mutations, as Mutpred2 predicted that these mutations did

174

not alter any molecular consequences of the proteins.

175

Moreover, molecular docking analysis revealed that mutations in spike proteins do not affect the

176

interaction with the ACE2 receptor; give us a notion that mutation in the spike protein maybe for the better

177

adaption of the SARS-CoV-2. Thus, therapeutics targeted against the spike protein of SARS-CoV-2 may

178

not give the expected result. This study also identified a domain in the spike protein (amino acid ranging

179

from 345 to 527) involved with human ACE2 receptor interaction rather than the whole protein. This

180

domain was conserved in all isolates reported in Bangladesh, resulting in no effect of the mutations. A

181

recent study identified the receptor-binding domain of spike protein, amino acid ranging from 319 to 541,

182

to interact with the ACE2 receptor, which is similar to our findings [39].

183

Conclusion

184

SARS-CoV-2 isolates from Dhaka and Chittagong were close to European and Mideast lineage. A large

185

deletion in the EPI_ISL_445213, EPI_ISL_445214, EPI_ISL_450343, and EPI_ISL_450344 isolates may

186

explain the less pathogenic result of COVID-19 compared to other countries. Mutations in the spike

187

protein of SARS-CoV-2 may induce more adaptation of this fetal virus; can cause less effective

188

therapeutics if targeted. Our study gives novel insights to understand the SARS-CoV-2 epidemiology in

189

Bangladesh.
