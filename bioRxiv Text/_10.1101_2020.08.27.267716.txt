ABSTRACT

25

The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic caused by severe acute respiratory

26

syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) becomes a tremendous threat to global health. Although

27

vaccines against the virus are under development, the antigen epitopes on the virus and their

28

immunogenicity are poorly understood. Here, we simulated the three-dimensional structures of

29

SARS-CoV-2 proteins with high performance computer, predicted the B cell epitopes on spike

30

(S), envelope (E), membrane (M), and nucleocapsid (N) proteins of SARS-CoV-2 using

31

structure-based approaches, and then validated the epitope immunogenicity by immunizing mice.

32

Almost all 33 predicted epitopes effectively induced antibody production, six of which were

33

immunodominant epitopes in patients identified via the binding of epitopes with the sera from

34

domestic and imported COVID-19 patients, and 23 were conserved within SARS-CoV-2, SARS-

35

CoV and bat coronavirus RaTG13. We also found that the immunodominant epitopes of domestic

36

SARS-CoV-2 were different from that of the imported, which may be caused by the mutations on

37

S (G614D) and N proteins. Importantly, we validated that eight epitopes on S protein elicited

38

neutralizing antibodies that blocked the cell entry of both D614 and G614 pseudo-virus of SARS-

39

CoV-2, three and nine epitopes induced D614 or G614 neutralizing antibodies, respectively. Our

40

present study shed light on the immunodominance, neutralization, and conserved epitopes on

41

SARS-CoV-2 which are potently used for the diagnosis, virus classification and the vaccine

42

design tackling inefficiency, virus mutation and different species of coronaviruses.

INTRODUCTION

51

The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic caused by the novel severe acute

52

respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) has caused unprecedented impact on global

53

health.

54

(https://covid19.who.int/) (Guan et al., 2020; Zhu et al., 2020). SARS-CoV-2 shares 96.2% and

55

79.5% genomic sequence identity with bat coronavirus and SARS-CoV, respectively, but it is

56

more contagious than SARS-CoV (Lu et al., 2020; Zhou et al., 2020). Prophylactic vaccines are

57

an important means to curb the pandemic of infectious diseases. Accordingly, effective and safe

58

SARS-CoV-2 vaccine is urgently needed. Eight SARS-CoV-2 vaccine candidates based on a

59

variety of technologies are being tested in clinical trials (Chen et al., 2020a; Thanh Le et al.,

60

2020). However, the epitopes on these vaccines and SARS-CoV-2 are not well-studied, and it is

61

still urgent to identify epitopes that can elicit neutralizing antibodies and determine the

62

immunodominant epitopes in humans for the improvement and design of novel vaccines.

More than

6 million

cases

were

reported by

WHO on

June 1, 2020

63

Four major structural proteins, spike (S), envelope (E), membrane (M), and nucleocapsid (N)

64

proteins play vital roles in entry and replication of the virus (Chen et al., 2020b). Several epitopes

65

on S protein have been reported although with little information of the immunogenicity and the

66

neutralization, but the most epitopes on M, E, and N proteins still remain unknown (Baruah and

67

Bose, 2020; Bhattacharya et al., 2020; Yuan et al., 2020a, b). The accuracy of the predicted

68

epitopes using in silico methods is unclear and the immunogenicity of the obtained epitopes needs

69

further experimental verification (Ahmed et al., 2020; Grifoni et al., 2020; Kiyotani et al., 2020).

70

Epitope prediction methods based on the three-dimensional structure of protein can greatly

71

improve the precision of antigen epitopes (Jespersen et al., 2017). Therefore, the reported 3D

72

structures of S and M proteins are conductive to epitope prediction (Jin et al., 2020; Lan et al.,

73

2020; Walls et al., 2020; Wrapp et al., 2020). Although the structures of E and N proteins are still

74

unsolved, it is possible to model these protein structures based on their reported gene sequence

75

using molecular simulation and then predict their epitopes (Lu et al., 2020). Increasing evidences

76

showed that some linear epitopes, as the sites of virus vulnerability, conserved regions or the key

77

components of conformational epitopes, play important roles in the induction of virus

78

neutralization (Alphs et al., 2008; Sok and Burton, 2018; Xu et al., 2018). For example, a linear

79

epitope of HIV induced broad-spectrum protection effect, and could be used to develop universal

80

vaccines (Kong et al., 2019). By identifying the conformational B cell epitopes with higher

81

degree of continuity and the appropriate linear window with key functional residues of

82

discontinuous B cell epitopes centralized and randomized, we may find the key components of

83

conformational epitopes.

84

The immunogenicity, immunodominance, especially neutralization of the epitopes is crucial for

85

the development of effective SARS-CoV-2 vaccines. Although the epitope immunodominance

86

landscape of S protein was mapped (Zhang et al., 2020), mutation on virus proteins might alter

87

the antigenicity of the virus and possibly affected human immune responses to the epitopes,

88

making it the central challenge for the vaccine development. Phylogenetic analysis showed that

89

SARS-CoV-2 mutated with a mutation rate around 1.8 × 10-3 substitutions per site per year (Li et

90

al., 2020). Within all the identified mutations of S protein, further investigation is needed on the

91

614th amino acid. G614 in S1 protein of SARS-CoV-2, found in almost all the COVID-19

92

patients outside China, exhibited higher case fatality rate and might be more easily spread than

93

D614 which mainly found in China (Becerra-Flores and Cardozo, 2020). The 614th amino acid is

94

located on the surface of S protein protomer and the G614 destabilized the conformation of viral

95

spike and facilitated the binding of S protein to ACE2 on human host cells (Becerra-Flores and

96

Cardozo, 2020). However, little is known about how G614 influences human immune responses

97

to SARS-CoV-2. In fact, the mutations not only on S protein, but also on E, M, N proteins might

98

affect human immune responses to the virus. The limited neutralizing effect by the vaccine using

99

S protein as the only antigen suggested that epitopes on E, M, and N proteins might be important

100

for SARS-CoV-2 vaccine design as well, and understanding how mutations affect human immune

101

responses to the virus is necessary (van Doremalen et al., 2020).

102

In this study, we predicted and synthesized the B cell epitopes on the surface of S, M, E, N

103

proteins of SARS-CoV-2, prepared 37 vaccines based on HBc virus-like particles (VLP) using

104

SpyCatcher/SpyTag system, validated the immunogenicity of the epitopes by immunizing mice,

105

and identified epitopes that could elicit neutralizing antibodies. We also determined

106

immunodominant epitopes on SARS-CoV-2 by mapping the epitopes with the sera from COVID-

107

19 convalescent patients and analyzed the relevance between epitope immunodominance and the

108

mutations on SARS-CoV-2 proteins.

RESULTS

111

Prediction of SARS-CoV-2 B cell epitopes and preparation of HBc-S VLPs displayed with

112

the epitopes

113

In order to predict antigen epitopes on SARS-CoV-2, we used high performance computer to

114

simulate the three-dimensional structures of S, M, E, N proteins, and then used computational

115

simulation calculations to obtain preliminary antigen epitope information based on epitope

116

surface accessibility. The spatial structure information of S, M, E, and N protein structure models

117

was obtained (Fig. 1A-D), in which structures of S and M were consistent with the reported

118

structures and the structures of E and N were obtained for the first time (Wrapp et al., 2020; Yan

119

et al., 2020). A total of 33 B-cell epitopes were predicted on the basis of protein structures and the

120

priority was given during the selection process to select sequences with high homology within

121

SARS-CoV and RaTG13 coronavirus strains (Table S1, Fig. S1). Within these epitopes, four of

122

them contained glycosylation sites (Watanabe et al., 2020; Wrapp et al., 2020) and the according

123

GlcNAc glycosylated epitopes were synthesized (Table S1), and 13 from S protein, 2 from E

124

protein, 3 from M protein, and 5 from N protein, respectively, are conserved with >80%

125

homology among SARS-CoV-2, SARS-CoV and bat coronavirus RaTG13 (Table S1). All the

126

epitopes were exposed on the surface of the virus (Fig. 1A-D) and had a high antigenicity score,

127

indicating their potentials in initiating immune responses. Therefore, they were considered to be

128

promising epitope candidates against B-cells for vaccine preparation.

129

The predicted epitope peptides of S, M, E, and N proteins were synthesized and conjugated

130

onto the surface of HBc-S VLPs via SpyCatcher/SpyTag isopeptide formation, respectively,

131

forming epitope peptide displaying HBc-S VLPs, termed as HBc-S-P VLPs. SDS-PAGE

132

confirmed that the epitope peptides were successfully conjugated onto HBc-S VLPs shown by

133

HBc monomers with higher molecular weight (Fig. S2A). Our TEM results showed that all the

134

HBc-S-P self-assembled into morphologically correct VLPs (Fig. S2B). We further assessed the

135

hydrodynamic diameter of HBc-S-P VLPs by DLS, and the results showed that all the HBc-S-P

136

VLPs were relatively uniform (PDI < 0.25) with a diameter around 40 nm (Fig. S2C, Table S2),

137

which was consistent with previous reports (Ji et al., 2018).

138

The epitopes elicit highly specific antibody responses

139

To assess the immunogenicity, the HBc-S-P VLPs were subcutaneously immunized to BALB/c

140

mice for three times and the serum antibody titers were assayed by ELISA (Fig. 1E). Epitopes

141

S455-469, S556-570, E12-25, M47-62, N59-73, and N357-373 elicited robust antibody responses

142

against peptides and/or S, N proteins in mice at 10 days after the second injection (≥1000, Fig.

143

S3). All the predicted epitopes boosted antibodies response against the corresponding epitope

144

peptides and the antibody titer reached at least 1000 after the third immunization, except for

145

M160-170 with antibody titer being only 230 (Fig. 1F). Accordingly, the epitopes S63-85, S205-

146

219, S455-469, S475-499, S556-570, S721-733, S793-812, S1106-1120, S1205-1222, N59-73,

147

N353-373 on S and N proteins also induced robust antibodies with titers greater than 10000

148

against S and N proteins, respectively (Fig. 1G and 1H). These results demonstrated that almost

149

all the predicted epitopes on S, M, E, and N proteins elicited immune responses with high levels

150

of antibodies, suggesting these epitopes have good immunogenicity. The GlcNAc glycosylated

151

epitopes also elicited sufficient amount of antibodies towards the corresponding epitope peptides

152

and S protein, respectively, and only S793-812(N) induced higher antibodies than that of the non-

153

glycosylated epitope (Fig. 1F and 1G).

154

Imported and domestic COVID-19 cases have different immunodominant epitopes

155

To investigate the spectrum of antibodies in COVID-19 patients, we detected the binding of the

156

early convalescent sera of 8 imported (Europe) cases which infected SARS-CoV-2 in early April,

157

2020 and 12 domestic (China) cases in early February, 2020 to various epitopes (Table 1). The

158

mean value plus three times of the standard deviation in healthy volunteers was used as the cut-

159

off value to define positive reactions and the epitope showing the average positive rate ≥50%

160

among patients was considered as an immunodominant epitope (Fig. 2A and S4). Our results

161

showed that S556-570, M183-197 and N357-373 were immunodominant in domestic COVID-19

162

patients (Fig. 2B-D), whereas S675-689 and S721-733 were immunodominant in imported

163

COVID-19 groups (Fig. 2E-F). Only N152-170 was immunodominant in both groups (Fig. 2G).

164

Notably, S556-570, N152-170 and S721-733 reacted with the sera of almost all the patients

165

(≥80%) in domestic or imported cases, respectively (Fig. 2B, 2F and 2G). These results indicated

166

that imported and domestic COVID-19 cases had different immunodominant epitopes.

167

To elucidate the possible cause of the difference in immunodominant epitopes, we sequenced

168

the S, M, N, and E genes of SARS-CoV-2 from imported and domestic COVID-19 patients. The

169

results showed that the sequences of E and M proteins were identical in both imported and

170

domestic COVID-19 patients. However, the gene sequences of imported and domestic strains

171

contained

172

K203R204/G189R203G204/R203G204/R203G204S344 in N protein, respectively (Table 1),

173

resulting in different immunodominant epitopes of different virus sub-strains which provide the

174

bases for the differential diagnosis.

175

The predicted epitopes induce neutralization antibody production

176

SARS-CoV-2 pseudo-virus neutralization assay is a well-accepted method to detect the ability of

177

vaccine to inhibit SARS-CoV-2 infection (Ni et al., 2020; Wang et al., 2020). To assess

178

neutralization antibodies induced by S protein epitopes, we incubated the immunization sera with

179

D614 or G614 SARS-CoV-2 pseudo-viruses and then the mixture was added to ACE2-293FT

180

cells which stably expressed ACE2. The results showed that immunized sera of S92-106, S139-

181

153, S439-454 and S455-469 epitopes inhibited SARS-CoV-2 pseudo-virus infection compared

182

to HBc-S control (p < 0.0001), with inhibition rates around 40%-50% (Fig. 3A). Also, the sera of

183

S16-30, S243-257, S406-420, S475-499, S556-570, S793-812(N) and S909-923 inhibited SARS-

184

CoV-2 infection with the inhibition rate from 20% to 40% (Fig. 3A), indicating that these 11

185

epitopes induced neutralization antibody production. To detect the effect of epitope immunization

186

on the neutralizing responses of G614 SARS-CoV-2, we incubated the epitope-immunized sera

187

with the G614 SARS-CoV-2 pseudo-viruses. The results showed that sera of epitopes inhibiting

188

D614 SARS-CoV-2 also inhibited G614 SARS-CoV-2 infection, except of S16-30, S243-257 and

189

S556-570 (Fig. 3B). However, the immunized sera of epitopes S63-85, S495-509, S675-689,

190

S703-719, S793-812, S1065-1079, S1065-1079(N), and S1106-1120 only inhibited G614 SARS-

191

CoV-2 pseudo-virus infection. Interestingly, compared with its non-glycosylation epitope, S63-

192

85(N), S703-719(N) and S1065-1079(N) induced less neutralizing antibodies to G614

193

pseudovirus while that of S793-812(N) increased (Fig. 3B). We then 2-fold serial diluted the sera

194

with inhibition rate >50%, and determined the neutralizing antibody titers induced by these

195

epitopes. S63-85 induced the highest neutralizing effect with antibody titer at 1:80 (Fig. 3C). The

196

structural analysis showed that most of these neutralizing epitopes to D614 and G614 SARS-

197

CoV-2 were in or near N-terminal domain (NTD), receptor-binding domain (RBD) or S2’

198

cleavage site of S protein and were spatially clustered (Fig. 3D-I), except S1106-1120 and S675-

199

689 which are in or near transmembrane domain and S1/S2 cleavage site at interface of S1 and S2

200

subunits of S protein, respectively.

DISCUSSION

205

Vaccines are potent means to control the current pandemic of COVID-19 and to prevent future

206

outbreak, thus fully understanding the immune responses elicited by the virus epitopes is urgent.

207

As antigenic determinants, identifying and understanding epitopes would facilitate vaccine design

208

and development. Since neutralization antibodies usually recognize the surface area of the virus

209

proteins, identification of epitopes in surface area based on 3D structure of proteins may increase

210

the efficiency to find the epitopes that elicit neutralization antibodies. In this study, we in first

211

time used high-performance computer to simulate the three-dimensional structures of major

212

proteins on SARS-CoV-2 and predicted 33 surface area epitopes using the modeled protein

213

structures, which was proved to be efficient and accurate by the further mouse immunization and

214

pseudo-virus neutralization assay. Within the 33 identified epitopes, 24 were conserved with >80%

215

homology and 18 shared >90% homology among SARS-CoV-2, SARS-CoV and bat coronavirus

216

RaTG13 (Table S1), implicating that these epitopes could be used as for designing broad-

217

spectrum betacoronavirus vaccines.

218

Some surface area epitopes of SARS-CoV-2 were determined to be immunodominant in

219

present study by detecting the binding of the antibodies in early convalescent sera of COVID-19

220

patient to various predicted epitopes. Consistent with previous report, S556-570 was an

221

immunodominant epitope and this epitope was able to elicit neutralization antibodies (Fig. 3A)

222

(Poh et al., 2020). S675-689 and S721-733 were immunodominant epitopes in imported strains

223

but not in domestic strains, which may result from antigenic drift by the 614th amino acid

224

variance on S protein of SARS-CoV-2 between imported and domestic cases. In most imported

225

cases, glycine was in the 614th position of S protein, which possibly made the S675-689 and

226

S721-733 regions more accessible by specifically destabilized the “up” state of the viral spike via

227

unpacking with T859 in adjacent helical stalk (Becerra-Flores and Cardozo, 2020). Moreover,

228

S556-570 was no longer an immunodominant and neutralizing epitope in the G614 strain and the

229

antibodies induced by S675-689 inhibited G614 but not D614 pseudo-virus entry into ACE2

230

expressing 293FT cells, implicating an antigenic drift was caused by the D614G mutation. Two

231

epitopes, N152-170 and N357-373, are highly conserved among the SARS-CoV-2, SARS-CoV

232

and bat coronavirus RaTG13. Consistent with previous reports, these two epitopes were

233

immunodominant sites (Guo et al., 2004). Importantly, they bound to neutralization antibodies in

234

recovered SARS-CoV patients (Guo et al., 2004; Shichijo et al., 2004). M183-197 is another

235

immunodominant epitope in domestic cases. Since this epitope is located in the S4 subsite of the

236

active center of M protein, it is possible for it to elicit neutralization antibodies that inhibit the

237

protease function of M protein (Dai et al., 2020; Yang et al., 2005). Interestingly, although no

238

sequence variance was observed on M protein from all sequenced COVID-19 cases, two

239

consecutive mutations (K203RR204G) were found in the highly conserved serine-rich linker

240

region (LKR) of N protein. Since the LKR region is essential for flexibility of N protein and

241

binds to M protein (Yang et al., 2005), it is possible that the R203G204 on N protein is relevant

242

with the epitope immunodominance of M183-197. The difference of immunodominant epitopes

243

from domestic and imported strains may have implications in designing assays for rapid

244

classification and verification of virus sub-strains.

245

Eleven and seventeen epitope regions epitopes were found to elicit neutralization antibodies

246

that inhibit the cell entry of D614 and G614 pseudo-virus, respectively. The antibodies induced

247

by four epitopes (S406-420, S439-454, S455-469, and S475-499) but not S366-381 or S495-509

248

in RBD region exhibited neutralization effect on both D614 and G614 pseudo-virus, which is

249

consistent with the interaction interface between SARS-CoV-2 receptor-binding motif (RBM)

250

and ACE2 (Seydoux et al., 2020; Shang et al., 2020), indicating that these epitopes are suitable

251

for designing universal vaccines. Previous report showed that a cryptic epitope in the trimeric

252

interface of S protein induced neutralization antibodies for SARS-CoV but not SARS-CoV2.

253

Consistently, the antibodies induced by epitope S366-381 did not show neutralization effect on

254

the entry of the pseudo-virus (Wrapp et al., 2020; Yuan et al., 2020b). Interestingly, not only the

255

antibodies targeting the interaction interface between RBD and ACE2, but also the antibodies

256

binding with N-terminal domain (NTD) of S protein, such as S16-30, S92-106, S139-153 and

257

S243-257 showed neutralization effect on D614 strain. Within the neutralizing NTD epitopes,

258

S92-106 and S139-153 also showed neutralization effect on G614 strain. Antibodies induced by

259

S63-85 but not its glycosylated form inhibited the cell entry of G614 pseudovirus rather than

260

D614 pseudovirus, and the epitopes S703-719(N) and S1064-1079(N) induced less neutralizing

261

antibodies compared to the unglycosylated ones, indicating native oligomannose and complex-

262

type N-glycan might pose a shield effect on the epitope and mutation at the 614th position

263

possibly affected the exposure of the epitope by altering the pose of the glycan shield (Barnes et

264

al., 2018). In contrast, the glycosylated epitope S793-812(N) showed more inhibitory effect than

265

that of S793-812 on both G614 and D614 pseudoviruses, suggesting that glycosylation on the

266

epitope might affect viral infectivity. Two conserved epitopes (S793-812(N) and S909-923) near

267

the highly-conserved S2’ protease cleavage site of S protein also induced neutralization

268

antibodies on both D614 and G614 pseudo-virus, indicating that there may be mechanism by

269

which blocks cell entry of SARS-CoV-2. Notably, several identified neutralizing epitopes are

270

consistent with the epitopes of some important neutralizing antibodies, such as S139-153 to

271

antibody 4A8 (PDB 7C2L), S406-420 to antibody C105 (PDB 6XCN) and S16-30 to antibody

272

P2B-2F6 (PDB 7BWJ) (Barnes et al., 2020; Chi et al., 2020; Ju et al., 2020), suggesting these

273

epitopes might be the antibody-targeting sites. Importantly, we first found a shift of

274

immunodominant and neutralizing epitope region from S556-S570 to S675-689 upon the D614G

275

mutation. S675-689 is at the S1/S2 cleavage site located at interface of S1 and S2 subunits of S

276

protein which is important for spike protein mediated virus-cell membrane fusion. Our results

277

suggested that the S675-689 epitope was at the vulnerability site of SARS-CoV-2 and might be

278

an ideal candidate and targeting site for vaccine development. Moreover, our results showed that

279

the neutralizing epitopes are highly spatial clustered, indicating that conformational epitopes in

280

the above regions may be used for designing an effective vaccine.

281

In conclusion, we have successfully predicted SARS-CoV-2 epitopes based on of the 3D

282

structures of S, M, N, E proteins, validated their immunogenicity, characterized the homology of

283

the epitopes among betacoronavirus, and identified the neutralization and immunodominant

284

epitopes (Table S3). Our findings provide a wide neutralization and immunodominant epitope

285

spectrum for the design of an effective, safe vaccine, differential diagnosis and virus

286

classification.

EXPERIMENTAL MODEL AND SUBJECT DETAILS

292

Specimens from SARS-CoV-2 patients

293

Serum samples were collected from 20 early convalescent patients with COVID-19 which were

294

confirmed by SARS-CoV-2 real-time reverse transcriptase–polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR).

295

12 patients were infected in China and the other 8 were imported cases from Europe. The median

296

age of imported and domestic patients was 50.8 years (range, 10-72 years) and 30.6 years (range,

297

17-50 years), respectively. This study was approved by the Institutional Review Board of the

298

Fifth Hospital of Shijiazhuang. Waiver of informed consent for collection of samples from

299

infected individuals was granted by the institutional ethics committee. Nucleic acids from throat

300

swab samples were extracted using SARS-CoV-2 Nucleic Acids Extraction Kit (Daan Gene,

301

Zhongshan, China) according to the manufacturer's instructions. The genes of S, N, E and M were

302

reverse transcripted, amplified and sequenced.

303

Mice

304

6-8 week-old BALB/c female mice were obtained from Beijing HFK Bioscience CO., LTD

305

(Beijing, China) and maintained with access to food and water ad libitum in a colony room kept

306

at 22 ± 2 °C and 50 ± 5% humidity, under a 12:12 light/dark cycle. All animal experiments were

307

performed in accordance with the China Public Health Service Guide for the Care and Use of

Laboratory Animals. Experiments involving mice and protocols were approved by the

309

Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee of Tsinghua University (AP#15-LRT1).

310

METHOD DETAILS

311

Epitope prediction

312

Homologous modeling and molecular dynamics simulation was used to predict the structure of S,

313

M, N, E protein. The genome sequence of SARS-CoV-2 isolate Wuhan-Hu-1 was retrieved from

314

the NCBI database under the accession number MN988669.1 and the protein sequences were

315

acquired according to the annotation. The original pdb file of the S, M, N, E protein was

316

established by homologous modeling using SWISS-MODEL (Waterhouse et al., 2018) according

317

to the template structures of SARS-CoV spike glycoprotein (PDB: 6ACC), SARS-CoV main

318

peptidase M(pro) (PDB: 2A5K), SARS-CoV envelope small membrane protein (PDB: 5X29) and

319

SARS-CoV nucleocapsid protein (PDB: 1SSK), respectively. On the basis of the homologous

320

modelled pdb file, added water, adjusted pH of chloride and sodium ions and ran molecular

321

dynamics simulation program, obtaining the pdb file in the human body temperature (310K) state.

322

We then calculated the full atomic structure of the protein for 1 μs using the molecular dynamics

323

software GROMACS 5.1 on Sunway TaihuLight supercomputer and obtained the molecular

324

orbital energy level and spatial structure information of the protein. In particular, the RBD region

325

was referred to as the fragment from 347 to 520 amino acid of S protein. Structure-based

326

conformational B cell epitope prediction was performed by using Discotope 2.0 (Kringelum et al.,

327

2012) and -2.5 was used as a positivity cutoff. All the appropriate linear epitope windows were

328

then selected by the following criteria: 1) solvate accessible regions with high surface probability;

329

2) regions with high antigenicity and flexibility; 3) the key functional residues of conformational

330

B cell epitopes were centralized and with high degree of continuity in the window. The selected

331

epitopes were then applied to homology analysis with the according sequences from SARS-CoV

332

and RaTG13 via ClustalW (Thompson et al., 1994). N-glycosylated regions with homology > 50%

333

were selected for synthesis of N-glycosylated epitopes. Epitope homology was calculated by the

334

following formula:
Epitope homology
=

Number of identical amino acids + Number of conservation substitution amino acids
Total Number of amino acids of epitope

× 100%
335

Preparation and characterization of HBc-S-peptide VLP vaccine

336

HBC-SpyCatcher (HBc-S) was purified as described previously (Ji et al., 2018). Purified protein

337

was concentrated and determined by BCA protein assay kit (Pierce, Rockford, IL, USA). The

338

purity of the recombinant protein was analyzed by SDS-PAGE. The peptides of SpyTag-epitope

339

were chemically synthesized by GL Biochem (Shanghai, China). For the preparation of epitope

340

conjugated HBc-S VLP vaccine, HBc-S VLPs were incubated with 3-fold molar excess of

341

epitope peptide for 3 h at room temperature in citrate reaction buffer (40 mM Na 2HPO4, 200 mM

342

sodium citrate, pH 6.2), and was then dialyzed with 100 kDa cut-off membrane to remove the

343

unreacted epitope peptide.

344

Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) was used for the morphological examination of

345

HBc-S-peptide

346

200 mesh copper grids for 5 min and negatively stained with 2% uranyl acetate for 1 min, and then

347

blotted with filter paper and air dried. VLPs were imaged in a Hitachi TEM system at 80 kV at

348

40,000 x magnification. To measure the hydrodynamic size of HBc-S-peptide VLP vaccine using

349

dynamic light scattering (DLS), 9 µL of HBc-S or HBc-S-P VLPs at concentration of 0.1 mg/mL

350

was loaded into a Uni tube and held at 2 min at room temperature. Each measurement was taken

351

four times with 5 DLS acquisitions by an all-in-one stability platform Uncle (Unchained lab,

352

USA).

354

To evaluate the immunogenicity of the epitopes, female BALB/c mice (6-8 weeks) were

355

subcutaneously vaccinated with HBc-S-P VLPs (containing 100 μg HBc-S) in citrate buffer (200

356

mM citrate acid, 40 mM NaH2PO4, pH 6.2, 100 μl) mixed with Alum (1:3 v/v) (ThermoFisher,

357

Waltham, MA, USA). HBc-S was used as a control. Each group of mice (n=5) received their first

358

injection at day 0 and boosters at day 14 and 28. Serum samples were taken 10 days after each

359

immunization.

360

Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA)

361

Serum antibodies specific for epitope peptides and SARS-CoV-2 proteins were detected by

362

ELISA. 96-well plates (Dynex Technologies, Chantilly, VA) were coated with 0.5 μg peptides,

363

100 ng S or N protein per well at 4°C overnight, respectively, and then washed 3 times with PBS

364

and blocked with 3% BSA (in 0.1% PBST) for 2 h at 37 °C. After blocking, the plates were

365

incubated with serial dilutions of the sera (100 μl/well, in two-fold dilution) for 2 h at 37 °C. The

366

bound serum antibodies were detected with HRP-conjugated goat anti-mouse IgG (Zhongshan

367

Golden Bridge Biotechnology Co., Beijing, China) and chromogenic substrate TMB

368

(ThermoFisher, Waltham, MA, USA). The cut-off for seropositivity was set as the mean value

369

plus three standard deviations (3SD) in HBc-S control sera. The binding of the epitopes to the

370

sera of COVID-19 infected patients were detected by ELISA using the same procedure as

371

described above, 96-well plates were coated with 0.5 μg peptides and sera were diluted at 1:50.

372

The cut-off lines were based on the mean value + 3SD in 4-5 healthy persons. All ELISA studies

373

were performed at least twice.

374

SARS-CoV-2 pseudovirus neutralization assay

375

Pooled mice sera collected at day 10 after the third immunization were diluted in DMEM

376

supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum, mixed with 1.6×106 SARS-CoV-2 pseudoviruses and

377

incubated at 37 ℃ for 1 h. The mixture was then added to 1.5×104 ACE2-293T cells and the

378

medium was replaced after 6 h. Firefly luciferase activity was measured 72 h post-infection using

379

Bright-Glo™ Luciferase Assay System (Promega). All neutralization studies were performed at

380

least twice. Three independently mixed replicates were measured for each experiment.

381

Statistical analysis

382

The data presented in this study were expressed as mean ± SEM. Data were analyzed by one-way

383

(ANOVA), followed by multiple comparisons using Dunnett’s test within GraphPad Prism 7.0

384

software. Student t-test was used to analyze the data of non-glycosylated and glycosylated

385

epitopes. p < 0.05 was considered to be significant.
