ABSTRACT

21

While MERS-CoV (Middle East respiratory syndrome Coronavirus) provokes a lethal

22

disease in humans, camelids, the main virus reservoir, are asymptomatic carriers,

23

suggesting a crucial role for innate immune responses in controlling the infection.

24

Experimentally infected camelids clear infectious virus within one week and mount an

25

effective adaptive immune response. Here, transcription of immune response genes was

26

monitored in the respiratory tract of MERS-CoV infected alpacas. Concomitant to the

27

peak of infection, occurring at 2 days post inoculation (dpi), type I and III interferons

28

(IFNs) were maximally transcribed only in the nasal mucosa of alpacas, provoking the

29

induction of interferon stimulated genes (ISGs) along the whole respiratory tract.

30

Simultaneous to mild focal infiltration of leukocytes in nasal mucosa and submucosa,

31

upregulation of the anti-inflammatory cytokine IL10 and dampened transcription of pro-

32

inflammatory genes under NF-κB control were observed. In the lung, early (1 dpi)

33

transcription of chemokines (CCL2 and CCL3) correlated with a transient accumulation

34

of mainly mononuclear leukocytes. A tight regulation of IFNs in lungs with expression

35

of ISGs and controlled inflammatory responses, might contribute to virus clearance

36

without causing tissue damage. Thus, the nasal mucosa, the main target of MERS-CoV

37

in camelids, is central in driving an efficient innate immune response based on

38

triggering ISGs as well as the dual anti-inflammatory effects of type III IFNs and IL10.

Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) is the etiological agent of

a respiratory disease causing high mortality in humans. In camelids, the main MERS-

transcriptional regulations of innate immunological pathways underlying asymptomatic

clinical manifestations of alpacas in response to MERS-CoV. Concomitant to the peak

45

of infection, these animals elicited a strong transient interferon response and induction

of the anti-inflammatory cytokine IL10 in the nasal mucosa. This was associated to a

key in controlling MERS-CoV disease by avoiding a cytokine storm. Understanding on

INTRODUCTION

55

The Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS) is a disease caused by a zoonotic

56

Coronavirus (MERS-CoV) that emerged in 2012 in the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia (1)

57

raising a toll of 2,562 confirmed human cases in 27 countries, with 881 deaths until the

58

November 2020 (2). In humans, MERS-CoV infection ranges from asymptomatic to

59

severe or even fatal respiratory disease (3). Dromedary camels are the main viral

60

reservoir (4), and all camelids are susceptible to the virus, under both natural and

61

experimental conditions (5–10). However, despite consequent tissue viral loads and

62

high viral shedding at the upper respiratory tract (URT) level, infection in camelids is

63

asymptomatic, leading to a rapid clearance of the virus (5, 9, 11) and the establishment

64

of a solid acquired immunity. Indeed, field studies revealed a high proportion of serum

65

neutralizing antibodies in dromedary camels (8, 12). Innate immune responses are

66

essential as they link adaptive immunity (13) and are key players in the pathology of

67

diseases (14). Nevertheless, the severity of MERS lesions in humans has been attributed

68

to aberrant innate and adaptive immune responses based essentially on data obtained

69

from macrophages isolated from healthy donors or infected patients, as well as dosage

70

of cytokines/chemokines from bronchoalveolar lavages. The outcome of these studies

71

reveals an overproduction of proinflammatory cytokines/chemokines due to the

72

activation of C-type lectin receptors, RIG-I like receptors (RLRs) and an impaired

73

production of type I interferons (IFN) (15–18). High production and persistent high

74

levels of these cytokines in macrophages are likely to exacerbate disease severity.

75

Despite that macrophages can be infected, at least in vitro, MERS-CoV has a preferable

76

tropism for respiratory epithelial cells (18). To date, no data is available on innate

77

immune responses affecting the human respiratory mucosa

78

information was mainly obtained from ex vivo pseudostratified primary bronchial

79

airway epithelial cells (18, 19), immortalized epithelial cells (19, 20) or respiratory

80

explants (21–23). Although some contradictory results have been reported, MERS-CoV

81

infections in these cells or tissues led to the conclusion that type I and III IFN are

82

inhibited (24, 25) or, when delayed (26), weakly expressed (27). Nonetheless, some

83

MERS-CoV African strains isolated from dromedary camels, as opposed to the Arabian

84

human isolated EMC/2012 strain, can induce higher levels of IFN, IFN1, IFN

85

stimulated genes (ISGs) and proinflammatory cytokines mRNA in Calu-3 cells after 48

86

h of infection (22). Indeed, the prototypic strain EMC/2012 and MERS-CoV African

87

strains belong to different clades (A and C respectively) displaying deletions

88

particularly in the ORF4b (22). In that respect, several viral factors, including MERS-

89

CoV accessory proteins 4a and 4b, have been shown in respiratory epithelial cell lines

90

to antagonize the production of IFNs, to interfere with the NF-B signaling pathway by

91

avoiding production of proinflammatory cytokines (28) and inhibiting the protein kinase

92

R-mediated stress response (29). In addition, in epithelial cell lines, the structural viral

93

protein N interacts with the host E3 ligase tripartite motif protein 25 (TRIM25)

94

impeding ubiquitination of RIG-I and further expression of type I interferons and IFN-

95

1 (30). Therefore, in contrast to the cytokine storm provoked by macrophages,

96

epithelial innate immune responses seem to be profoundly paralyzed. This is of major

97

consequence for the progression of the disease, since the respiratory mucosa is the

98

primary barrier for MERS-CoV. Recent findings indicate that type III IFNs confer

in vivo and most

99

initial protection, restricting tissue damage at the mucosa level by limiting inflammatory

100

responses and potentiating adaptive immunity. Furthermore, it is postulated that when

101

the viral burden is high and the mucosal fitness is broken, type I IFNs take over, leading

102

to enhanced immune responses provoking also uncontrolled pro-inflammatory

103

responses (31).

104

Owing that bats, the primary reservoir for coronaviruses, are tolerant to MERS-CoV

105

(and other viruses) due to a dampened Nod-like receptor family pyrin domain-

106

containing 3 (NRLP3) inflammasome (32), it was of major interest to gain insights into

107

innate immune responses induced by MERS-CoV in camelids. Therefore, by

108

understanding how reservoir/intermediary hosts control MERS-CoV and by extension

109

other coronaviruses, a wealth of information could be translated to other species

110

experimenting severe disease for the improvement of prevention, treatments and

111

vaccines.

112

In the present study, alpacas were experimentally infected and monitored at the

113

transcriptional level for a set of innate immune response genes along the upper and

114

lower respiratory tract (LRT) during four consecutive days. Special attention was given

115

to the nasal epithelium as it is the primary site of MERS-CoV replication. Regulation of

116

IFNs, pattern recognition receptors (PRRs), IFN regulatory transcription factors (IRFs)

117

and enzymes constituting the NRLP3 inflammasome or the NF-κB pathway was

118

analyzed providing insights on signaling mechanisms important for MERS-CoV

119

replication and disease progression, elucidating key regulatory host factors to counteract

120

MERS-CoV infection.

124

CoV infection in camelids. The MERS-CoV Qatar15/2015 strain was selected because

125

clade B strains are nowadays exclusively circulating in the Arabian Peninsula (4, 33).

126

Three alpacas (AP13-AP15) were euthanized before virus inoculation and served as

127

controls, while groups of three animals (AP1-AP3, AP4-AP6, AP7-AP9, AP10-AP12)

128

were sacrificed sequentially during four consecutive days after MERS-CoV inoculation.

129

nasal swabs (NS) and respiratory tissue samples were collected at the day of euthanasia.

130

Following virus inoculation, only one alpaca (AP6) secreted a mild amount of nasal

131

mucus on 2 days post inoculation (dpi). None of the remaining animals showed clinical

132

signs and basal body temperatures remained constant (below 39.5ºC) throughout the

133

study.

134

Nasal viral shedding and MERS-CoV loads in respiratory tracts during infection

135

in alpacas

136

On the day of euthanasia (0, 1, 2, 3, and 4 dpi), NS were collected. Viral detection and

137

loads were assessed by RT-qPCR. All MERS-CoV inoculated alpacas (AP1-AP12)

138

shed viral RNA, but no major differences were detected between the different time

139

points. Also, viral titration in NS showed that all inoculated animals excreted infectious

140

MERS-CoV. Maximal viral loads in the nasal cavity were reached at 2 dpi. Of note,

141

animal AP6 shed the highest loads of infectious virus (4.8 TCID50/ml). None of the

142

alpacas, including negative controls (AP13-AP15), had viral RNA or infectious virus on

143

0 dpi (Fig. 1A).

144

MERS-CoV RNA was detected in all homogenized respiratory tissues during infection.

145

The higher viral loads were found on 2 dpi in nasal turbinates and bronchus with a

146

significant increase compared to those detected on 1 dpi. Trachea and lung displayed

147

the lowest viral RNA loads. In all cases, at 4 dpi, infectious virus was still excreted, and

148

viral RNA was present in the respiratory tract (Fig. 1B).

149

MERS-CoV establishes early infections in URTs and LRTs of alpacas

150

Histopathology of URTs and LRTs was assessed in a blinded manner independently by

151

veterinary pathologists. On 2 and 3 dpi, histological lesions in MERS-CoV infected

152

alpacas were limited to the respiratory tract, being of multifocal distribution and mild.

153

Lesions in nasal turbinates were characterized by mild rhinitis, segmental hyperplasia of

154

the nasal epithelium, lymphocytic exocytosis, loss of epithelial polarity and tight

155

junction integrity. Additionally, small numbers of lymphocytes with fewer macrophages

156

infiltrated the underlying submucosa. No microscopic lesions were observed in nasal

157

turbinates on 0, 1 and 4 dpi in any of the animals, which displayed a multifocal

158

localization of the MERS-CoV antigen detected by immunohistochemistry (IHC).

159

While only a few pseudostratified columnar epithelial cells in the nose contained

160

MERS-CoV antigen on 1 dpi, the number of positive epithelial cells was remarkably

161

high on 2 dpi; such number steadily decreased in the alpacas necropsied on the

162

following days. On 4 dpi, the MERS-CoV antigen was scarcely detected with no

163

evidence of microscopic lesions (Fig. 2A).

164

Trachea and bronchus showed multifocal, mild tracheitis/bronchitis, with the presence

165

of few lymphocytes in the epithelium and mild infiltration of the submucosa by

166

lymphocytes and macrophages on 2 dpi. In line with these observations, MERS-CoV

167

infected cells were rarely detected within the epithelium on 2 dpi by IHC, mostly in

168

areas displaying these minimal lesions (Fig. 2B). Remarkably, the trachea of AP6

169

harbored the highest viral load as detected by IHC. Few labeled cells were observed on

170

4 dpi (Table S1) with no evidence of lesions. Additionally, lung lobes showed mild

171

multifocal perivascular and peribronchiolar infiltration by lymphocytes and the presence

172

of monocyte/macrophages within the alveoli, being more evident on 2dpi. MERS-CoV

173

antigen was occasionally observed in bronchiolar epithelial cells on 2 dpi (Fig. 2B), and

7

174

rarely on 4 dpi (Table S1). Of note, pneumocytes were not labeled by MERS-CoV IHC

175

(Fig. 2B).

176

Viral loads in micro-dissected nasal tissues and whole tracheal and lung sections

177

Viral loads and viral transcription/replication were also assessed on methacarn-fixed

178

paraffin-embedded (MFPE) tissue sections which were further used for cytokine

179

quantification. Special attention was given to the nasal epithelium as it is the privileged

180

tissue for viral replication. Thus, laser capture microdissection (LCM) was used to

181

obtain, when possible and for each animal, nasal epithelial areas positive or negative for

182

MERS-CoV, as assessed by IHC, in different but consecutive (parallel) MFPE tissue

183

sections. Their respective underlying submucosa were also collected at 1 and 3 dpi (Fig.

184

S1). Moreover, MFPE sections of tracheas and lungs were directly scrapped from the

185

slide. On 1 dpi only a few isolated nasal epithelial cells were IHC positive. These were

186

micro-dissected, as described above, with the surrounding IHC negative cells to get

187

enough RNA for the microfluidic PCR quantitative assay. To the contrary, due to the

188

massive infection in nasal tissues at 2 dpi, only IHC negative nasal epithelial areas from

189

AP4 could be collected. Viral loads in micro-dissected nasal tissues and MFPE tracheal

190

and lung scrapped samples were quantified with UpE primers using the microfluidic

191

quantitative PCR assay. As illustrated in Fig. S2A, micro-dissected MERS-CoV

192

infected epithelial areas, as assessed by their parallel IHC stained sections, showed

193

higher viral loads than non-labelled epithelial areas, confirming the validity of the

194

technique. In agreement with immunohistochemical observations, MERS-CoV RNA

195

was of lower abundance in submucosal layers. As expected, and according to results

196

obtained with tissue macerates (Fig. 1B), microfluidic quantification of MERS-CoV

197

viral RNA revealed a much lower degree of virus replication in trachea and lung than in

198

nasal tissues. These results were confirmed with the M mRNA microfluidic PCR (Fig.

8

200

infection in tissues, in particular in the nasal epithelia, than that revealed by IHC.

201

High induction of type I and III IFNs in the nasal mucosa occurs at the peak of

202

infection in alpacas

203

In order to investigate the antiviral pathways induced upon MERS-CoV infection,

204

relative mRNA expression levels for 37 innate immune response genes were assessed

205

along the respiratory tract with the same cDNA samples as those used for viral UpE and

206

M mRNA quantifications in a Fluidigm BioMark microfluidic assay. In all nasal

207

mucosa of non-infected animals, IFNβ mRNA was undetecTable and comparisons for

208

this gene were performed against levels of expression found in animals infected on 1

209

dpi. For IFNλ3 very low basal levels, at the limit of detection (Cq=25), were found in 2

210

out of 3 animals on 0 dpi. All other gene transcripts were detected at basal levels in

211

control non-infected animals and were used as calibrator values (Data set S1B).

212

At the level of MERS-CoV infected nasal epithelia (positively stained by IHC), most of

213

the transcription variations occurred and peaked at 2 dpi. Genes coding for IFNβ (mean

214

of 200 Fc) and IFNλ3 (mean of 350 Fc), and to a lesser extent IFNα (mean of 6 Fc) and

215

IFNλ1 (mean of 11 Fc) were significantly upregulated. Relative expression of type I

216

IFNs (α and β) and type III IFNs (λ1 and λ3) decreased progressively on 3 and 4 dpi

217

(Fig. 3A and B).

218

The same patterns of gene transcription were observed for ISGs with antiviral activity

219

(ISG15, MX1, CXCL10 and OAS1), IRF7, cytoplasmic viral RNA sensors (RIG1 and

220

MDA5) and, although moderately upregulated, the endosome viral double and single

221

stranded RNA sensors (TLR3 and TLR7 respectively) and the transcription factor

222

STAT1. The E3 ubiquitin ligase TRIM25, an important enzyme that plays a key role in

223

RIG1 ubiquitination, was upregulated on 2 dpi (mean of 4.5 Fc) and decreased

224

afterward (Fig. 3A and B and Data set S1C).

225

The pro-inflammatory antagonist IL10 was upregulated at 2 dpi (mean of 10 Fc) and

226

returned to nearly steady state levels in the following days (Fig. 3A and B). Only three

227

genes involved in inflammation, TNF, IL6 and IRF5 (mean of 2.5-3 Fc for each of

228

them), were found slightly upregulated at 2 dpi, while the levels of expression of other

229

critical pro-inflammatory factors, such as the cytokines IL8, IL1β, the adaptor

230

PYCARD and the PRRs NLRP3, were marginally or not affected by the infection (Fig.

231

3A, Fig. S3A and Data set S1C). Although not statistically significant, CASP1, an

232

essential component of the inflammasome (as PYCARD and NLRP3), experienced

233

moderate mRNA increases (2 to 8 Fc following the animals) at 2 and 3 dpi (Fig. S3A).

234

Finally, the chemo-attractant chemokines CCL2 and CCL3 were non-significantly

235

upregulated (mean of 5 Fc) as shown in Fig. S3A.

236

Nasal epithelium negative by IHC for MERS-CoV exhibited a moderate but non-

237

significant increase for type I and III IFNs mRNA on 2, 3 and 4 dpi. However, ISG15,

238

MX1, RIG1, MDA5, TLR3, IRF7, IL10 and TRIM25 genes were upregulated at 3 dpi

239

but to a lower degree than in positive IHC epithelial areas (Fig. 3A and B). Invariably,

240

all the above-mentioned genes had a significant decreased expression from 2 dpi

241

onwards. Transcription of most of the inflammatory cytokines was not affected or

242

slightly downregulated upon infection (Fig. 3A, Fig. S3A and Data set S1C).

243

As shown in Fig. S4, increased induction of type I IFNs in nasal epithelial micro-

244

dissected samples was weakly correlated to increased viral MERS-CoV loads and

245

transcription levels of IL10. In contrast, upregulation of type III IFNs had a stronger

246

correlation with higher viral loads, as assessed by microfluidic PCR quantification of

247

the viral M mRNA (r = 0.64, P = 0.004 for IFNλ1 and r = 0.64, P = 0.0163 for IFNλ3),

248

the UpE gene (r = 0.65, P = 0.0033 for IFNλ1 and r = 0.64, P = 0.0163 for IFNλ3) and

249

increased relative mRNA levels of IL10 (r = 0.9, P <0.0001 for IFNλ1 and r = 0.8, P =

250

0.0009 for IFNλ3). Our data indicate that antiviral mechanisms are set during the peak

251

of infection in the nasal epithelia with a timely induction of type I and III IFNs, ISGs

252

and IL10 without exacerbation of pro-inflammatory cytokines.

253

ISGs and PRRs but not IFNs are upregulated in the nasal submucosa of infected

254

alpacas: evidence for a potential IFN paracrine signaling

255

To further investigate the repercussion of MERS-CoV infection in the mucosa, innate

256

immune responses occurring in the underlying submucosa were determined. Micro-

257

dissected areas from the submucosa of control and infected animals (1 and 3 dpi) were

258

analyzed for relative mRNA expression of innate immune genes. Except for IFNλ3

259

which was not detected in any inoculated or control animals, all other IFNs were

260

expressed at basal levels in control non-infected alpacas. IFNβ was undetected at 1 dpi

261

in two inoculated animals (AP2 and AP3) and below basal levels in alpaca AP1 while

262

IFN and IFN1 were marginally fluctuating. Most of the major transcriptional

263

modifications occurred at 3 dpi. In submucosa underlying the most infected epithelia

264

areas, IFNλ1 was expressed at basal levels while IFNα and IFNβ were not induced. On

265

the contrary, ISGs, IRFs and PRRs, like ISG15 (mean of 77 Fc), OAS1 (mean of 6 Fc),

266

MX1 (mean of 46 Fc), CXCL10 (mean of 14 Fc), RIG1 (mean of 12 Fc), MDA5 (mean

267

of 16 Fc), IRF7 (mean of 9 Fc) and TLR7 (mean of 5 Fc) were highly to moderately

268

upregulated. Expression of genes constituting the inflammasome was mostly not altered

269

for NRLP3 or moderately increased for CASP1 (mean of 5 Fc) and PYCARD (mean of

270

3 Fc); but remarkably, IL1β was significantly downregulated (mean of 3 Fc; Fig. 4A

271

and B). Also, except for a non-significant increase of TNFα (mean of 5 Fc) and a slight

272

upregulation of IRF5 (mean of 3 Fc; P < 0.05), no other pro-inflammatory factors were

273

upregulated. Indeed, IL8 was downregulated (mean of -40 Fc). According to these

274

findings, the anti-inflammatory cytokine IL10 (mean of 3.5 Fc) was moderately

275

upregulated (Fig. 4A, B and Data set S1D). Furthermore, the submucosa underlying

276

epithelial cells with no MERS-CoV IHC labelling showed the same patterns of cytokine

277

profiles as for that underlying heavily MERS-CoV infected mucosa but to a lesser

278

degree of expression (Fig. 4A and B). Overall, results obtained in the submucosa are

279

indicative of a potential IFN paracrine signaling from the epithelium for the occurrence

280

of ISGs induction in the absence of significant IFN mRNA synthesis. Moreover, despite

281

mild focal infiltrations (Fig. 2), genes involved in the inflammatory process were either

282

suppressed, unaltered or mildly activated.

283

ISGs are upregulated in the trachea of infected alpacas without increased

284

endogenous IFNs mRNA

285

Innate immune response genes were further monitored along the URT. In trachea, IFNβ

286

and IFNλ3 mRNA transcripts were not detected at any time post-inoculation including

287

on 0 dpi. From 1 to 4 dpi, expression of IFNα and λ1 was slightly downregulated or

288

unaltered, compared to basal levels found in non-infected controls (Fig. 5A and Data set

289

S1E). Genes coding for ISGs (ISG15, MX1 and OAS1) and PRRs (RIG1, MDA5 and

290

TLR3) showed a significant mRNA upregulation mainly at 2 and 3 dpi. When

291

compared with animals necropsied at 1 dpi, IRF7 was significantly upregulated (mean

292

of 9 Fc) at 2 dpi (Fig. 5A and B). The expression of IL10 was not significantly altered

293

(Fig. 5A and Fig. S3B). The induction of proinflammatory cytokine genes was inhibited

294

or remained unchanged at all post-inoculation points (Fig. 5A, B and Fig. S3B), except

295

for AP6. This animal unlike other alpacas sacrificed at 2 dpi experienced an

296

upregulation of proinflammatory cytokines and the inflammasome in the trachea.

297

However, IL6 and PYCARD mRNA levels were almost unaltered (Fig. 5A, Fig. S3B

298

and Data set S1E). Excluding OAS1, AP6 was the animal with the highest expression

299

levels of ISGs, RNA sensors, transcriptional factors and chemokines as shown in Fig.

300

5A, B, D, Fig. S3B and Data set S1E. In that respect, AP6 could be considered as an out

301

layer since, unlike other animals, it presented nasal discharges with the highest number

302

of infected cells in nose and trachea and the highest viral loads in trachea (Table S1 and

303

Data set S1A). Moreover, when compared to AP4 and AP5, which displayed nearly

304

basal levels of CCL2 and CCL3 transcripts (Fig. 5C, Fig. S5A and Data set S1E), the

305

tracheal submucosa of AP6 was moderately infiltrated by macrophages and

306

lymphocytes (Fig. 5D). This also provides indirect proof that the chemokines CCL2 and

307

CCL3 were produced at the protein level and exerted chemoattraction.

308

Early induction of CCL2 and CCL3 correlates with infiltration of macrophages

309

and lymphocyte like cells in the lungs of infected alpacas

310

Despite low infectivity of MERS-CoV in the LRT, infiltration of leukocytes was

311

observed suggesting that cytokines and chemokines are at play. At the lung level, IFNα

312

and IFNλ1 were expressed on 0 dpi in non-infected controls. In response to MERS-CoV,

313

transcripts of IFNα and IFNλ1 fluctuated around basal levels (Fig. 6A and Data set S1F).

314

IFNλ3 and IFNβ mRNAs were not detected in any of the animals including controls.

315

Upregulation of ISGs (ISG15, MX1 and OAS1) and IRF7 started at 1 dpi, reached a

316

peak at 2 dpi and weaned at 4 dpi. RIG1 and MDA5 were unevenly upregulated with a

317

lower intensity than for other tissues (Fig. S3C and Data set S1F). Remarkably, NLRP3

318

was moderately but significantly upregulated at 1, 2 and 4 dpi concomitant with

319

increased levels of TNFα and IL1β at 1 dpi (Fig. 6A and B). However, transcription of

320

CASP1 remained unaltered and the PYCARD gene was downregulated at 1, 2 and 4 dpi

321

or unaltered at 3 dpi (Fig. S3C and Data set S1F). IL15, a natural killer cell activator

322

cytokine, was significantly upregulated at 1 and 2 dpi while expression patterns of other

13

323

proinflammatory cytokines varied between animals and days of infection (Fig. 6A and

324

B, Fig. S3C and Data set S1F).

325

In addition, CCL2 and CCL3 were moderately to highly upregulated at most of the time

326

points (Fig. 7A, Fig. S3C and Fig. S5B). All animals showed very mild infiltration of

327

leukocytes in the alveoli in response to MERS-CoV (Fig. 7B and Fig. S5C).

328

Remarkably, AP6 showed accumulation of leukocytes without a noTable induction of

329

CCL2 and CCL3 mRNAs. Moreover, this animal was the highest producer of these

330

chemoattractant chemokines in trachea. Nonetheless, the number of infiltrating

331

leukocytes correlated with the induction of CCL2 (r = 0.62, P = 0.0236) and CCL3 (r =

332

0.59, P = 0.0323) as shown in Fig. S5D and E. When considering AP6 as an out layer,

333

correlations became stronger for both CCL2 (r = 0.72, P = 0.0077) and CCL3 (r = 0.87,

334

P = 0.0002) as shown in Fig. 7A. Overall, ISGs were induced in the absence of IFN

335

gene expression suggesting an endocrine effect of IFNs produced in the nasal epithelia.

336

In addition, despite transient accumulation of leukocytes correlating with induction of

337

CCL2 and CCL3 in the lung, exacerbation of inflammatory responses did not occur.

338

Genes of the NF-κB pathway and IRF5 are transcriptionally unaltered in

339

respiratory tissues during MERS-CoV infection

340

Transcription of the NF-κB p50 subunit (NFKB1) and some important regulators of the

341

NF-κB pathway were checked along URTs and LRTs. These regulators included two

342

enzymes, AZI2 and TBK1, downstream of the RLRs and TLR signaling pathways,

343

essential for the phosphorylation of NF-κB, the NF-κB inhibitor NFKBIA and an

344

adaptor CARD9 that mediates signals from C-type lectins to regulate the NF-κB

345

pathway (Fig. S6). All these genes were expressed at basal levels in the nasal mucosa,

346

submucosa, trachea and lung of control non-infected alpacas. NFKB1, AZI2 and TBK1

347

were only marginally induced or remained unaltered in the nasal epithelia; however,

14

348

NFKBIA and CARD9 were expressed at basal levels or even slightly downregulated in

349

all the tissues. All the above mentioned genes were fluctuating around basal

350

transcriptional levels across alpaca respiratory tracts (Fig. 3A-6A and Data set S1 C-F)

351

indicating that the NF-κB mediated signaling pathway was not exacerbated or

352

downregulated in response to MERS-CoV. Moreover, IRF5, an inducer of TNF and

353

IL6 as well as an important factor for the polarization of M1 macrophages, was only

354

slightly but significantly upregulated in the nasal epithelium (2 dpi) and submucosa (3

355

dpi). In all other tissues and, in particular lung, the majority of animals did not reach the

356

threshold of 2 Fc for IRF5 (Fig. S3C and Data set S1F).

DISCUSSION

359

The present study expose an integrated investigation at the respiratory tract level

360

performed in vivo in a natural reservoir/intermediate host upon MERS-CoV infection.

361

As camelids are the primary zoonotic reservoirs for human infection, it is essential to

362

gain insight into the potential mechanisms of asymptomatic manifestation since they

363

can unravel targets for prophylactic treatments in susceptible hosts. In the present study,

364

all experimentally inoculated alpacas were successfully infected, as genomic viral UpE,

365

subgenomic M mRNA and the N protein could be detected in most of the tissues

366

examined by IHC, RT-qPCR or micro fluidic PCR assays from the URT and LRT at 1

367

to 4 dpi. This proved that the MERS-CoV Qatar15/2015 strain had spread and in some

368

instance replicated throughout the whole respiratory tracts, although mainly at the URT

369

where the virus receptor DPP4 (dipeptidyl peptidase) is most abundant (34).

370

Acknowledging that respiratory mucosal epithelial cells are the main primary target for

371

MERS-CoV and the paucity of data on the effect in vivo of the virus to the mucosal

372

barrier on humans and other laboratory species (mainly human DPP4 transgenic or

15

373

transduced mice and non-human primates) a special attention was given here to monitor

374

innate immune responses occurring during the first 4 days of infection in the nasal

375

epithelium of alpacas and the possible repercussions of these responses in the

376

respiratory tract.

377

In mucosa, pathogens are sensed by PRRs leading to the production of type I and III

378

IFNs via IRFs. In turn, IFNs can activate through the JAK-STAT pathway, in an

379

autocrine, paracrine or endocrine manner, transcription of various antiviral and

380

regulatory ISGs including also PRRs and IRFs. Fine tuning of these responses is

381

paramount in determining the outcome of viral infectious diseases (31). In MERS-CoV

382

infected alpacas, during the first 24h, apart from IFNβ which started to be induced, type

383

I and III IFNs were not altered in the nasal mucosa when compared to control animals.

384

This short period seems to be crucial for the virus to establish a productive infection in

385

alpacas for at least 5 to 6 days (5) by delaying host protective mechanisms such as

386

activation of PRR pathways (17, 30, 35). Nonetheless, and only in the nasal epithelium,

387

transcription of all type I and III IFNs peaked simultaneously at 2 dpi and weaned

388

progressively. This wave of IFNs was concomitant with the induction of ISGs, PRRs

389

and IRF7 not only at the nasal epithelial barrier and its underlying submucosa but also

390

in trachea and lungs where IFN mRNAs were never detected or induced. Therefore, the

391

effect of the IFN response at the nasal mucosa may extend to distant respiratory tissues

392

in a paracrine or endocrine manner. In that respect, in mice, IFN produced in the URT

393

prevents dissemination of influenza virus to the lung (36).

394

The use of IHC and microfluidic PCR assays combined with LCM permitted to

395

compare, in the same and different animals, areas of the nasal epithelium with high and

396

low viral loads. Heavily infected mucosal areas were responsible for the highest

397

induction of type III IFNs. Although markedly induced, type I IFNs did not

16

398

significantly correlated with tissue viral loads. Consistent with this IFN production, the

399

number of MERS-CoV infected cells detected by IHC was maximal on 2 dpi and

400

decreased over time. However, all infected alpacas shed infectious viral particles in the

401

nasal cavity from 1 dpi onwards according to previous studies (5, 6). This might be due

402

to a high accumulation of virus in the nasal cavity which may take a few days to clear.

403

Remarkably, results obtained herein contrast with those found in human epithelial cells

404

and respiratory explants since the induction of type I and III IFNs was limited or

405

inhibited in response to MERS-CoV (19, 20, 23). The dampened IFN priming in

406

humans is likely due to the role of IFN antagonism by MERS-CoV accessory proteins

407

(20, 24, 29, 37), through which virus replication is facilitated. It is important to note that

408

the MERS-CoV strain (Qatar15/2015) used herein is from human origin and, unlike

409

some dromedary isolated African strains, it does not display any deletions in the above-

410

mentioned non-structural proteins (22). Therefore, alpacas are able to overcome IFN

411

inhibitory mechanisms in a relative short time with the induction of antiviral or IFN

412

positive regulatory ISGs. Nonetheless, the prominent manifestation of MERS in humans

413

occurs in lungs with a massive inflammation provoked by infiltration of macrophages

414

and lymphocytes (38). To the contrary, and although AP6 experienced discrete nasal

415

discharges and displayed large numbers of infected nasal epithelial cells, alpacas only

416

exhibited transient mild and focal infiltration of lymphocytes, macrophages and

417

neutrophils in response to MERS-CoV. Such infiltrations were mainly observed on 2

418

dpi and gradually resolved afterwards. These findings suggested a rapid fine tuning of

419

specific mechanisms to control inflammation mediated essentially by the mucosal

420

barrier, leading to an efficient innate immune response. Indeed, type III IFNs are known

421

to induce milder inflammatory responses than IFN (31) and IL10 is an anti-

422

inflammatory cytokine (39). Furthermore, recent studies in mice indicate intricate

17

bioRxiv preprint doi: https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.11.23.395301; this version posted November 25, 2020. The copyright holder for this

423

mechanisms between IFN and IL10 via dendritic cells (DC) conditioning protective

424

mucosal immunity against influenza virus (40). In this view, it is noteworthy to mention

425

that plasmacytoid DC are seemingly the only cell-type that produce in vitro type I and

426

III IFNs after MERS-CoV infection in humans (41). By contrast, in vivo, pDCs which

427

predominantly localize in the submucosa are not the main IFN producers (42, 43). Due

428

to the lack of specific cell markers for DC in alpacas, detection of these cells in tissues

429

and their contribution to innate immunity could not be performed. Nonetheless, a strong

430

positive correlation between IFNλ1,3 and IL10 mRNA levels was observed in the nasal

431

epithelium of alpacas and this could reflect a physiological cross-regulation between

432

these structurally related cytokines upon MERS-CoV infection. By contrast, the weak

433

correlation between IFNβ and IL10 mRNA induction suggests that only type III IFNs

434

are directly or indirectly mediating anti-inflammatory action. Furthermore, IL10 was

435

significantly up regulated, although at moderate levels, in the nasal submucosa

436

underlying heavily infected epithelial cells. Moreover, IRF5 known to be a pro-

437

inflammatory transcription factor and a key element in the M1 polarization of

438

macrophages (44, 45) was only slightly induced in the nasal mucosa and submucosa on

439

2 and 3 dpi. However, no IRF5 mRNA increased in the lung despite infiltration of

440

mainly macrophages and lymphocytes as early as 1 dpi. Accordingly, CCL2, CCL3,

441

CXCL10 and TNFα were induced in the lung in the absence of type I IFNs, as found for

442

MERS-CoV infected human monocyte-derived macrophages (16). With the observation

443

that other pro-inflammatory cytokines are either weakly or not induced, it is suspected

444

that inflammatory M1 macrophages are not abundant in the lung of infected alpacas.

445

Also, IL15, an activator and attractor of NK cells and macrophages (46), was only

446

induced in lung as soon as 1 dpi, suggesting a role for clearance of the virus by these

447

cells. Strikingly, NLRP3 mRNA was more abundant in the lung (with the exception of

18

bioRxiv preprint doi: https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.11.23.395301; this version posted November 25, 2020. The copyright holder for this

448

AP6 in trachea), maybe due to the presence of infiltrating macrophages where NLRP3

449

is mostly produced (47, 48). However, CASP1 and PYCARD, the two other

450

components of inflammasome, were not induced. This scenario, combined with a

451

discrete upregulation of IL1β and IL6 in some animals, will not probably result in a

452

cytokine storm in the lung. Accordingly, in other respiratory tissues, the major

453

proinflammatory cytokines were occasionally mildly induced, suggesting also a

454

functional but attenuated NF-κB signaling (49). Moreover, during infection, genes

455

involved in the regulation of the NF-κB cascade (AZI2, TBK1 and NFKBIA) and

456

NFKB1were transcriptionally unaltered in all the respiratory tract of alpacas preventing

457

acute inflammation in response to MERS-CoV.

458

In a mice model of MERS-CoV (35), IFNs production and MERS-CoV replication

459

peaked simultaneously in lungs at 2 dpi resulting in a sublethal infection. While early

460

induction or treatment with IFN were crucial for virus clearance and induction of

461

protective immunity, late administration of IFNs led in lungs to enhanced infiltrations

462

of monocytes, macrophages, neutrophils, expression of proinflammatory cytokines and

463

increased mortality. Also, indirect proof was given that IFNs synthesis was under

464

sensing of TLR7 but not MAVS in airway epithelial cells. However, this study did not

465

report the effect of MERS-CoV infection in the URT (35). Benefits of early type I IFN

466

treatment were also shown for non-human primates (50) but IFN therapy on humans has

467

failed so far certainly because it was applied essentially on critically ill patients (51).

468

Thus, some differences are noticed between a MERS-CoV sublethal infection in mice

469

and that occurring in a natural host. Here, we highlighted the essential role of the nasal

470

mucosa as a main producer of IFNs upon MERS-CoV infection driving in combination

471

with IL10 a mild inflammatory response along the respiratory tract. The observation in

472

alpacas of a dimmed NLRP3 inflammasome is consistent with that found in bat primary

473

immune cells infected in vitro with MERS-CoV (32), suggesting a primary role in the

474

control of inflammation in reservoir/intermediary hosts despite high viral loads. Further,

475

this study provides mechanistic insights on how innate immunity overcomes a MERS-

476

CoV infection. A proposed model of cytokine and signaling pathways interactions

477

resuming innate immune responses upon MERS-CoV infection in the respiratory tract

478

of alpacas is depicted in Fig. 8. Inherent to any study performed with large outbred

479

animals under BSL3 containment, the present study suffers some limitations. First, the

480

number of animals used was kept to minimal to avoid prolonged exposure of personnel

481

during sampling and necropsies hindering some statistical significances with variations

482

between animals. Second, the LCM and microfluidic PCR allowed determination of

483

gene expression at the tissue but not the single cell level. This combined with the lack of

484

antibodies defining cell types in alpaca and working in IHC impeded further

485

characterization of DCs and leukocytes in tissues.

cultures (50% tissue culture infectious dose endpoint [TCID50]), as previously

499

described (9).

500

Laser capture microdissection (LCM)

501

For each animal, four consecutive sections from the same MFPE-block containing nasal

502

specimens were cut and processed as described in the supplementary material and

503

method section. One of the sections was subjected to IHC to localize infected/non

504

infected cells in the tissues and served as a reference (template) for the three subsequent

505

sections which were subjected to LCM. Infected and non-infected nasal epithelium

506

(mucosa) areas, as assessed by IHC in the template section, as well as their respective

507

underlying submucosa areas were delineated and micro-dissected using the Leica

508

LMD6500 (Leica AS LMD; Wetzlar, Germany) system (6.3× magnification, Laser

509

Microdissection 6500 software version 6.7.0.3754). More detailed information is

510

provided in Fig. S1 for visualization of the microdissection process.

511

Dissected specific areas from each three MFPE sections were measured and introduced

512

into RNase-free 0.5 ml Eppendorf tubes with buffer PKD from the miRNeasy FFPE Kit

513

(Qiagen, Valencia, CA, USA). Direct microdissection of IHC stained MFPE sections

514

were attempted but failed to provide RNA with enough quality and yields for further

515

microfluidic quantitative PCR assays.

516

Total RNA isolation and cDNA synthesis

517

Total RNA extraction from micro-dissected or scraped tissues was performed using the

518

miRNeasy FFPE Kit, following the manufacturer's instruction. Isolated RNA was

519

concentrated by precipitation in ethanol, purified using RNeasy MinElute spin columns

520

(Qiagen, Hilden, Germany) and treated for 10 min with DNase I (ArcticZymes,

521

Norway). cDNA was generated from 110 ng of total RNA using the PrimeScript™ RT

522

reagent Kit (Takara, Japan) with a combination of both oligo-dT and random hexamers

523

following manufacturer’s instructions. Additionally, total RNA extracts from MERS-

524

CoV infected nasal epithelia of AP5, 6, 7, 8, 9 and 11 were pooled at the same

525

proportion per animal and used to generate cDNA controls for validation of gene

526

expression assays.

527

Selection of innate immune genes, primers design and microfluidic quantitative

528

PCR assay

529

Thirty-seven innate immune genes were selected to study the gene expression and

530

transcriptional regulation of the main known canonical signaling pathways acting on

531

antiviral innate immunity and inflammation (Fig. S6). Primer design and validation for

532

an efficient cDNA amplification (Table S2) is described in detail in the Text S1 section

533

(Text S1). cDNA from micro-dissected or scraped tissue samples were used to quantify

534

camelid gene expression levels in duplicates by a microfluidic qPCR with the 96.96

535

Dynamic Array integrated fluidic circuit of the Biomark HD system (Fluidigm

536

Corporation, South San Francisco, USA), according to the manufacturer’s instructions

537

(see Text S1).

538

Relative quantification of innate immune response genes and statistical analyses

539

Data analyses and normalization of microfluidic qPCR assays is described in the Text

544

normalizer genes of the studied samples. Then, the target amount is normalized by using

545

the combination of three reference control genes. The normalized quantity (NQ) values

546

of individual samples from infected animals at different dpi were used for comparison

547

against the NQ mean of three non-infected control animals (calibrator) per assay. Thus,

548

the up- or down-regulated expression of each gene was expressed in fold changes (Fc)

549

after dividing each individual NQ value with the calibrator. Unlike all other tested

550

genes, IFNβ mRNA was undetecTable in the nasal epithelia of non-infected control

551

animals, therefore, comparisons for this gene in the nasal epithelia were performed in

relation to the mean of IFNβ levels of three infected alpacas on 1 dpi. Data set S1C-F

553

recompiles all the results expressed in Fc relative to the control alpacas obtained with

554

the Fluidigm microfluidic assay for all 37 genes tested. Data set S1A shows the

555

quantification, expressed in Cq values, of MERS-CoV genomic (UpE) and subgenomic

556

RNA (M mRNA), obtained with the microfluidic qPCR assay. Data set S1B indicates

557

the expression levels (in Cq values) of all genes from non-infected alpacas euthanized at

558

0 dpi. The limit of detection for expressed genes was Cq=25. A logarithmic 10

559

transformations were applied on Fc values to approach a log normal distribution. Thus,

560

the Student’s t-test could be used to compare the means of the logarithmic Fc obtained

561

at different dpi for each group of animals. Significant upregulation or downregulation of

562

genes was considered if they met the criteria of a relative Fc of ≥2-fold or ≤2-fold

563

respectively with P < 0.05. Having determined that RT-qPCR data (Cq values) are

564

normally distributed according to the Shapiro-Wilk normality test, the Tukey's multiple

565

comparisons test was applied to compare Cq values of tissue samples at different dpi.

566

Differences were considered significant at P < 0.05. Correlation coefficients were

567

determined using the Spearman’s correlation test.

Fig. 8. Proposed mechanistic model for MERS-CoV-induced protective innate immune

897

responses in alpaca respiratory tracts. (A) Upon MERS-CoV infection of nasal

898

epithelial cells, PRRs and IRFs are engaged to induce IFNs and ISGs exerting their

899

effects in an autocrine or paracrine manner. Upregulation of IL10 combined with the

900

action of type III IFNs will result in a dimmed synthesis of proinflammatory cytokines

901

under NF-κB control. Induced chemokines lead to focal, mild infiltration of leukocytes.

902

The paracrine effect of IFNs is evidenced in the nasal submucosa where ISGs are

903

upregulated without endogenous induction of IFNs. IL10 and type III IFNs will act on

904

the NF-κB pathway preventing production of IL8 and IL1β mRNAs depriving the

905

NLRP3 inflammasome of its substrate. Slight increased levels of IRF5 mRNAs will

906

indicate the presence of few M1 macrophages in the submucosa. Blue, red and white

907

arrows indicate upregulation, downregulation and unaltered gene transcription

908

respectively. (B) Concomitant to decreased viral loads, transcription of ISGs is lowered

909

in trachea and lungs where IFNs are not induced. Infiltration of mainly mononuclear

910

leukocytes occurs in the lungs as a result of chemokine synthesis in the absence of IRF5

911

induction but upregulation of IL15. Thus, reduced number of M1 macrophages and

912

activation of NK cells will contribute to a controlled inflammation and clearance of the

913

virus. PI, Pro-inflammatory cytokines; NI, not induced.

Fig. S6. Pattern recognition receptors (PRRs), IFN signaling and pro-inflammatory

998

cytokine pathway involving antiviral innate immunity induced by RNA viruses. Upon

999

sensing of RNA viruses, PRRs interact with their associated adapter proteins, thereby

1000

transmitting downstream signals to nuclear factor (NF-κB) and interferon regulatory

1001

factors (IRF3, IRF5 and IRF7) which further stimulate the production of pro-

1002

inflammatory cytokines (IL6, IL8, IL15, TNFα, CCL3, CCL2 CXCL1, NLRP3 and pro-

1003

IL1β) and IFNs (predominantly type I and III IFNs), respectively. Importantly, IRF5, is

1004

also a potent inductor of pro-inflammatory cytokines. The production of IFNs enhances

1005

the release of interferon stimulated genes (ISGs) which exert both, antiviral and host

1006

gene regulatory activities. IFNs can act in an autocrine and paracrine manner to induce

1007

the expression of ISGs via the JAK- STAT signaling pathway. While type I and III IFNs

1008

induce a similar set of ISGs (RIG1, MDA5, STAT1, IRF3, IRF5, IRF7, CXCL10, MX1,

1009

OAS1, ISG15, TRIM25), type I IFN signaling also activates pro-inflammatory

1010

cytokines and chemokines, which in turn recruit leukocytes to the site of infection. IL10

1011

functions as an anti-inflammatory cytokine that activates STAT3 which is involved in

1012

the negative regulation of NF-κB. AZI2 and TBK1 (which also phosphorylate IRFs)

1013

participate positively in the NF-κB signaling pathway while IκBα inhibits translocation

1014

of NF-κB in the nucleus until degradation. Activation of the inflammasome, composed

1015

of NLRP3, PYCARD (ACS) and pro-CASP1 leads to the auto- cleavage of pro-CASP1

1016

releasing CASP1 which further cleaves pro-IL1β into its mature form. The pro-

1017

apoptotic enzyme CASP10 and the adaptor CARD9 (acting downstream of C- type

Fig. 7. Infiltration of leukocytes in alveoli are correlated with
upregulation of CCL2 and CCL3 mRNA. (A) Relative expression of CCL2
and CCL3 mRNA (Bar graphs at the left) was performed with a
microfluidic PCR assay in the lung of alpacas (except AP6, see text).
Leukocytes were counted in 3 microscopic fields (400X) per lung
section in all animals (except AP6), including non-infected controls.
Relative expression levels of CCL2 and CCL3 were plotted against the
number of inflammatory cells (dot plot at the right). Correlation
coefficients were established using the Spearman’s correlation test
(right panel). (B) The number of leukocytes in alveoli was the highest
in AP5, lower in AP10 (arrows), occasional in AP7 (arrow) and hardly
detectable in AP13. Original magnification: ×1000 for all samples.

Fig. 8. Proposed mechanistic model for MERS-CoV-induced protective innate immune responses in alpaca respiratory tracts. (A) Upon MERS-CoV infection of nasal epithelial cells,
PRRs and IRFs are engaged to induce IFNs and ISGs exerting their effects in an autocrine or paracrine manner. Upregulation of IL10 combined with the action of type III IFNs will
result in a dimmed synthesis of proinflammatory cytokines under NF-κB control. Induced chemokines lead to focal, mild infiltration of leukocytes. The paracrine effect of IFNs is
evidenced in the nasal submucosa where ISGs are upregulated without endogenous induction of IFNs. IL10 and type III IFNs will act on the NF-κB pathway preventing production
of IL8 and IL1β mRNAs depriving the NLRP3 inflammasome of its substrate. Slight increased levels of IRF5 mRNAs will indicate the presence of few M1 macrophages in the
submucosa. Blue, red and white arrows indicate upregulation, downregulation and unaltered gene transcription respectively. (B) Concomitant to decreased viral loads, transcription of
ISGs is lowered in trachea and lungs where IFNs are not induced. Infiltration of mainly mononuclear leukocytes occurs in the lungs as a result of chemokine synthesis in the absence
of IRF5 induction but upregulation of IL15. Thus, reduced number of M1 macrophages and activation of NK cells will contribute to a controlled inflammation and clearance of the
virus. PI, Pro-inflammatory cytokines; NI, not induced.
