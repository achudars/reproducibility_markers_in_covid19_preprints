Abstract
SARS-CoV-2, the etiologic agent behind COVID-19, exemplifies the general threat to global
health posed by coronaviruses. The urgent need for effective vaccines and therapies is leading to
a rapid rise in the number of high resolution structures of SARS-CoV-2 proteins that collectively
reveal a map of virus vulnerabilities. To assist structure-based design of vaccines and
therapeutics against SARS-CoV-2 and other coronaviruses, we have developed CoV3D, a
database and resource for coronavirus protein structures, which is updated on a weekly basis.
CoV3D provides users with comprehensive sets of structures of coronavirus proteins and their
complexes with antibodies, receptors, and small molecules. Integrated molecular viewers allow
users to visualize structures of the spike glycoprotein, which is the major target of neutralizing
antibodies and vaccine design efforts, as well as sets of spike-antibody complexes, spike
sequence variability, and known polymorphisms. In order to aid structure-based design and
analysis of the spike glycoprotein, CoV3D permits visualization and download of spike
structures with modeled N-glycosylation at known glycan sites, and contains structure-based
classification of spike conformations, generated by unsupervised clustering. CoV3D can serve
the research community as a centralized reference and resource for spike and other coronavirus
protein structures, and is available at: https://cov3d.ibbr.umd.edu.

Introduction
Coronaviruses (CoVs) have been responsible for several outbreaks over the past two decades,
including SARS-CoV in 2002-2003, MERS-CoV in 2012 (1), and the current COVID-19
pandemic, caused by SARS-CoV-2, which began in late 2019 (2). The scale of the COVID-19
pandemic has led to unprecedented efforts by the research community to rapidly identify and test

therapeutics and vaccines, and to understand the molecular basis of SARS-CoV-2 entry,
pathogenesis, and immune targeting.

Since February 2020, a large number of SARS-CoV-2 protein structures have been released in
the Protein Data Bank (PDB) (3). As of June 17th, 2020, this includes 28 spike glycoprotein
structures, over 150 main protease structures, and over 60 structures of other SARS-CoV-2
proteins. These high-resolution protein structures are of immense importance for understanding
viral assembly and to aid rational vaccine and therapeutic design. The first structures of the
SARS-CoV-2 trimeric spike glycoproteins (the major target of SARS-CoV-2 vaccines and
antibody therapeutics) were reported in February and early March 2020 (4,5). Previously
determined spike glycoprotein structures have enabled advances including rational stability
optimization of SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV spikes, yielding improved protein expression and
immunogenicity (6). Given that the rapid rate of coronavirus protein structural determination and
deposition is likely to continue, a simple and updated resource detailing these structures would
provide a useful reference.

Here we describe a new database of experimentally determined coronavirus protein structures,
CoV3D. CoV3D is updated automatically on a weekly basis, as new structures are released in the
PDB. Structures are classified by CoV protein, as well as bound molecule, such as monoclonal
antibody, receptor, and small molecule ligand. To enable insights into the spike glycoprotein, we
also include information on SARS-CoV-2 residue polymorphisms, overall coronavirus sequence
diversity of betacoronaviruses mapped onto spike glycoprotein structures, and structures of spike
glycoproteins with modeled glycans, as a reference or for subsequent modeling. This resource

can aid in efforts for rational vaccine design, targeting by immunotherapies, biologics, and small
molecules, and basic research into coronavirus structure and recognition. CoV3D is publicly
available at https://cov3d.ibbr.umd.edu.

Methods
Web and database implementation
CoV3D is implemented using the Flask web framework (https://flask.palletsprojects.com/) and
the SQLite database engine (https://www.sqlite.org/).

Structure identification, visualization, and glycan modeling
Structures are identified from the PDB on a weekly basis using NCBI BLAST command line
tools (7), with coronavirus protein reference sequences from SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV, and
SARS-CoV-2 as queries. The spike glycoprotein reference sequences (GenBank identification
NP_828851.1, YP_009047204.1 and QHD43416.1 for SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV and SARSCoV-2 virus respectively) are used as queries to identify all available spike glycoprotein
structures. Peptide-MHC structures containing coronavirus peptides are identified in the PDB
through semi-manual searches of the PDB site and literature, though future automated updates
are planned in conjunction with an expanded version of the TCR3d database (8). Structural
visualization is performed using NGL viewer (9). N-glycans are modeled onto spike
glycoprotein structures using a glycan modeling and refinement protocol in Rosetta (10). An
example command line and Rosetta Script for this glycan modeling protocol is provided as
Supplemental Information.

Spike clustering and classification
Root-mean-square distances (RMSDs) between all pairs of full CoV spike glycoprotein chains
were computed using the FAST structure alignment program (11). The resultant distance matrix
was input to R (www.r-project.org) which was used to perform hierarchical clustering, and the
dendrogram was generated using the dendextend R package (12). The spike chains were
classified into two clusters based on this analysis, corresponding to open and closed spike states.

Sequence data collection and analysis
SARS-CoV-2 spike glycoprotein sequences were downloaded from NCBI Virus (13), followed
by filtering out sequences with missing residues. Sequence polymorphism information was
obtained by BLAST search using a reference SARS-CoV-2 spike glycoprotein sequence
(QHD43416.1). To develop spike glycoprotein alignments, betacoronavirus spike glycoprotein
sequences were downloaded from NCBI Virus (13) and aligned with Clustal Omega (14) in
SeaView (15). Sequences that were redundant (>95% similarity) or contained missing residues
were removed, with the remaining 70 sequences forming the Pan-betacoronavirus alignment. A
subset of 18 sequences from the pan-betacoronavirus alignment was used to generate the SARSlike sequence alignment, which contains every sequence from the pan-betacoronavirus alignment
with >70% sequence similarity to the SARS-CoV-2 spike. Sequence logos are generated
dynamically for user-specified residue ranges using the command-line version of WebLogo (16).
Phylogenetic trees representing spike reference sequences were generated using ClustalX (17),
and visualized using the APE package (18) in R (www.r-project.org).

Database contents
The main components of the CoV3D database are interrelated tables, datasets, and tools for
coronavirus protein structures and spike glycoprotein sequences. A schematic of the CoV3D
input, organization, and contents is shown in Figure 1. The structure portion of the database
includes dedicated pages and tables for:
•

Spike glycoprotein structures

•

Spike conformational classification

•

Antibody structures

•

Spike structures with modeled glycans

•

Main protease structures

•

Other SARS-CoV-2 protein structures (nucleocapsid, NSPs, ORFs, etc.)

•

Peptide-Major Histocompatibility Complex (MHC) structures with coronavirus peptides

Spike glycoprotein structures are annotated by binding partner(s), including bound antibody and
receptor, as well as domains present in the structure. Protease structures include annotation of
bound ligand, for convenience of those investigating protease inhibitors computationally or
experimentally. Antibody structures are annotated by complementarity determining region
(CDR) loop clusters, assigned by PyIgClassify (19).
Spike conformational classifications are performed for each chain in structures containing
full spike glycoproteins with a receptor binding domain (RBD) present in the structure.
Unsupervised clustering based on spike root-mean-square distances (RMSDs) automatically
classifies the spike structures into two broad clusters (Figure 2), corresponding to open and
closed conformations (also referred to as “up” and “down” conformations); these forms are
relevant for receptor binding and vaccine design (4,5), and annotations of those states based on

this analysis are included in CoV3D. Out of 129 SARS-CoV-2, SARS-CoV, and MERS-CoV
spike structures in the current set, 39 of them are assigned to the open state, while the remaining
90 are closed (Figure 2).
The sequence section of CoV3D focuses is focused on spike glycoprotein variability, and
includes:
•

Spike glycoprotein residue polymorphisms

•

Spike glycoprotein sequence logos based on sets of betacoronavirus sequences

•

Visualization of conservation on spike glycoprotein structures

Additional features of the database include a page with recently released structures, and a
downloads page for users to download structural data, sequence data, and tables. Summary
statistics are also given, providing metrics such as number of spike structures released for SARSCoV, MERS-CoV, and SARS-CoV-2.

Example use case: viewing sarbecovirus conservation in an RBD antibody epitope
In addition to a table of all known structures of CoV spike proteins and their interactions,
CoV3D provides a viewer with SARS-CoV-2 spike RBD interactions with antibodies and the
ACE2 receptor superposed by RBD in a common reference frame (Figure 3A). This viewer
permits users to assess overlapping or shared RBD binding modes among antibodies and ACE2.
One antibody of interest is S309, which is a human antibody that was cloned from an individual
who was infected with SARS-CoV in 2003, and potently neutralizes SARS-CoV-2 (20).
Comparing its RBD binding with ACE2 in the RBD interaction viewer (Figure 3A) highlights
how S309 engages the RBD at a distinct site from ACE2, in accordance with their lack of
observed RBD binding competition (20). The epitope targeted by S309 is dominated by RBD

residues 334-346 (circled in Figure 3A). On the CoV3D sequence logo generator page, users can
enter spike residue ranges, and generate sequence logos that represent positional residue
propensities and conservation for regions of interest, based on sets of CoV spike sequences. A
sequence logo generated from a reference set of spike proteins from 18 SARS-like CoVs is
shown in Figure 3B, indicating the conservation of the N-glycosylation site (NxS/NxT sequon)
at position 343, and amino acid variability at position 340, which is glutamic acid (E) in SARSCoV-2. Both the N343 glycan and the E340 side chain are directly engaged by S309 in the
recently determined complex structure (20).

Example use case: visualizing glycosylation
N-glycosylation of viral glycoproteins can play a key role by masking the glycoprotein from the
immune system, or affecting function (21). Experimentally reported protein structures often lack
N-glycans, or large portions thereof, due to limitations from resolution or intrinsic glycan
dynamics or heterogeneity. To enable visualization and additional analysis or modeling of
glycosylated spike glycoproteins, CoV3D includes sets of structures with modeled N-glycans at
all predicted glycosylation sites, with N-glycans built onto the glycoprotein structures and
refined using new tools in Rosetta based on previously developed glycan functionality (10).
Examples of glycosylated structures that can be visualized in CoV3D are shown in Figure 4, and
these can be downloaded directly by users for further processing. This permits users to view
features such as the N-glycosylation present on the ACE2 surface (Figure 4A) and the relatively
high glycosylation of the spike glycoprotein stem (bottom in Figure 4B). Presently, these
structures include uniform oligomannose glycoforms that were found to be prevalent on the
SARS-CoV spike based on previous mass spectroscopy analysis (22), with five branched

mannose sugars. In the future, we plan to include more spike structures with modeled glycans,
and to possibly include glycoforms that reflect mass spectroscopy experimental characterization
of the SARS-CoV-2 spike (23).

Discussion
We have constructed the CoV3D database as a reference for the research community, providing
a simple and updated interface to all coronavirus 3D structures, with integrated molecular
viewers, structural classification, and a variety of other useful features. This will allow
researchers to identify new coronavirus protein structures as they are released, particularly for
SARS-CoV-2, while enabling insights into spike glycoprotein antibody recognition, sequence
features, polymorphisms, and glycosylation. Recently released SARS-CoV-2 spike-antibody
complex structures have revealed mechanisms of cross-reactive CoV spike targeting and
neutralization (20,24,25), and many ongoing antibody identification and characterization studies
are likely to result in many more antibody-spike structures in the near future. CoV3D facilitates
the use of these growing structural datasets in analysis, modeling, and structure-based design
efforts by collecting and annotating these structures and their conformations, and by providing
inline structural viewing of single and multiple complexes.
