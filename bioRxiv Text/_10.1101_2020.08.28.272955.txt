Abstract
The worldwide SARS-CoV-2 outbreak poses a serious challenge to human societies and economies.
SARS-CoV-2 proteins orchestrate complex pathogenic mechanisms that underlie COVID-19 disease. Thus,
understanding how viral polypeptides rewire host protein networks enables better-founded therapeutic
research. In complement to existing proteomic studies, in this study we define the first proximal
interaction network of SARS-CoV-2 proteins, at the whole proteome level in human cells. Applying a
proximity-dependent biotinylation (BioID)-based approach greatly expanded the current knowledge by
detecting interactions within poorly soluble compartments, transient, and/or of weak affinity in living cells.
Our BioID study was complemented by a stringent filtering and uncovered 2,128 unique cellular targets
(1,717 not previously associated with SARS-CoV-1 or 2 proteins) connected to the N- and C-ter BioIDtagged 28 SARS-CoV-2 proteins by a total of 5,415 (5,236 new) proximal interactions. In order to facilitate
data exploitation, an innovative interactive 3D web interface was developed to allow customized analysis
and exploration of the landscape of interactions (accessible at http://www.sars-cov-2-interactome.org/).
Interestingly, 342 membrane proteins including interferon and interleukin pathways factors, were
associated with specific viral proteins. We uncovered ORF7a and ORF7b protein proximal partners that
could be related to anosmia and ageusia symptoms. Moreover, comparing proximal interactomes in basal
and infection-mimicking conditions (poly(I:C) treatment) allowed us to detect novel links with major
antiviral response pathway components, such as ORF9b with MAVS and ISG20; N with PKR and TARB2;
NSP2 with RIG-I and STAT1; NSP16 with PARP9-DTX3L. Altogether, our study provides an unprecedented
comprehensive resource for understanding how SARS-CoV-2 proteins orchestrate host proteome
remodeling and innate immune response evasion, which can inform development of targeted therapeutic
strategies.

Introduction
Over a century after the Spanish flu pandemic, and despite undeniable medical advances in
infectiology, modern human societies and economies are deeply shaken by the magnitude of the current
worldwide SARS-CoV-2 outbreak. Unprecedented and coordinated research efforts are needed to
overcome the current crisis. While we keep learning daily on COVID-19 clinical features, brute-force drug
screening and therapeutic trials have not yet proven their efficacy. A fine understanding of SARS-CoV-2
pathogenesis at a molecular level is thus required to: (i) supervise and understand drug assays to combat
viral mechanisms; and (ii), prepare potential future pandemics. To date, three major proteomic studies
define most of our direct knowledge of SARS-CoV-2 protein interactions with host cell components 1,2,3.
These works rely on classical immunoprecipitation (IP) methods followed by mass spectrometry (MS)based identification of physical interactors. The major limitation of IP-MS is the requirement of
maintaining protein-protein interactions (PPIs) throughout the purification process. This implies using
gentle lysis buffer to solubilize physically associated proteins without disrupting PPIs, hence precluding the
detection of poorly soluble protein partners, or for which PPIs have low affinity. The proximity-dependent
biotinylation technique (BioID)4 circumvents most of these caveats. Briefly, it consists of fusing an abortive
mutant of E. coli biotin ligase (BirA R118G; or BirA*) at the N- or C-terminal end of a protein of interest.
Upon addition of biotin in the culture media of living cells expressing the BirA*-tagged protein of interest,
the BirA* moiety activates biotin to biotinoyl-AMP in an ATP-dependent manner. Due to the low affinity
of mutated BirA* for this highly reactive species, it diffuses away and conjugates to nearby free amine
groups within an estimated radius of ~10 nm5. Since proximal proteins are covalently biotinylated, it is no
longer required to maintain stable interaction during the purification process. This enables stringent lysis
conditions that can solubilize proteins from all compartments, including e.g. transmembrane proteins.
Biotinylated species, i.e. proteins that have been in proximity of the bait protein in living cells, can then be
readily captured on streptavidin affinity columns and identified by MS following on-bead digestion, as
described6. Allowing the identification of PPIs through covalent labeling of proximal partners in living cells,
regardless of their solubility or affinity, proximity-dependent interactomics techniques are of outstanding
interest to gather biochemical insights on how the SARS-CoV-2 proteins operate to hijack host cell.
Results
Study overview. In our study we implemented BioID to capture the proximal interactors of the 28 SARSCoV-2 polypeptides: (i) ORF1a/b, two polyproteins encoding 16 non-structural proteins NSP1-16. Notably,
NSP11 was excluded from our analysis due to its small size (12 AAs); (ii) four structural proteins: Spike (S)

glycoprotein, small envelope (E) protein, membrane (M) glycoprotein and nucleoprotein (N); (iii) seven
accessory proteins: ORF3a, ORF3b, ORF6, ORF7a, ORF7b, ORF8, ORF9b; and (iv), two hypothetical proteins
ORF14 and ORF10 (Supplemental Table 1). All viral protein ORFs were first cloned in fusion with an N-ter
and a C-ter BirA* tag in pDEST FRT/TO BirA* backbones by Gateway cloning, using our pDONR SARS-CoV2 vector collection as templates1. To identify human protein partners, sequences encoding each BirA-fused
viral protein were then integrated into Flp-In 293 T-REx cell line genomes and, following stable cell line
selection, expressed in a tetracycline-inducible manner for 24 hours in biotin-supplemented media (as
described 8). Importantly, to mimic an infectious context and trigger cellular antiviral- response resembling
what occurs following SARS-CoV-2 infection, we conducted an additional set of experiments where the 28
cell lines expressing N-terminally BirA*-tagged viral genes were stimulated by poly(I:C) transfection for five
hours prior biotin labeling induction. This set of experiments was designed to investigate how viral proteins
could interfere with proteins expressed or activated upon viral infection since it is now well established
that COVID-19 is associated with a deficient interferon (IFN) type I and III response and an exacerbated
inflammatory reaction9. Immunofluorescence assays were conducted to assess the localizations, the
proper expression and efficient biotinylation capability of the bait proteins. Biotinylated species were
solubilized, captured on streptavidin columns and identified by MS (see Supplemental Material and

Methods for details). Following background removal using a set of 30 negative control runs (a series of cell
samples expressing BirA* alone covering the different experimental settings), the proximal interactomes
of all 28 viral proteins, each used as both N-terminally- and C-terminally-tagged baits augmented by those
obtained following poly(I:C) treatment yielded 10,267 high confidence proximal interactions by a total of
2,598 host partners (Supplemental Table 1).
Network topology. The global data-driven network shape reveals a core of thirteen baits and concentrated
prey proteins surrounded by fifteen bait interactomes dragged out by unique set of partners (Fig.1). This
initial observation suggests that the core viral bait proteins participate in building and organizing the
cellular virus factories, whereas the peripheral viral bait proteins could hijack or impair discrete cellular
functions to create a suitable environment for viral survival and progeny production. More than 90% of
Core prey proteins are assigned to membranes (192 to the ER, 117 to the Golgi, 127 to vesicles and 180 to
plasma membranes). These membrane-rich organelles appear as the primary location of 15 viral proteins.
Therefore, to facilitate data interpretation, we considered the most connected interactors as
compartment-specific proximal background. To segregate specific sets of interactors between the core
bait proteins, we chose to filter out all prey proteins connected to eight or more bait proteins.

This arbitrary filter reduced the number of interactors from 2,598 to 2,128, and the total number of
interactions dropped from 10,198 to 5,415 (Supplemental Table 1 and online dashboard). Expectedly, the
core was the most affected region of the network structure. This filtering allowed its relaxation (Fig.1),
revealing the connection of highly enriched groups of interactor/protein complexes to specific viral bait or
subsets of viral bait proteins. For each viral protein, we summarized the main locations of their interactors
(Fig.2.A and B). In addition to gene ontology and pathway enrichment analysis (Supplemental Table 1;
Supplemental Table 2 and Supplemental Table 3), we manually curated the data for each viral bait
proteins and assigned them to main predicted functions based on their most notable interactomes
features (Fig.2.C). Since our experimental design consisted in expressing a single BirA*-tagged viral protein
at a time, we describe each proximal interactome profile separately. For each bait protein (Figs.3-31), a
Venn diagram shows the hit distribution between the different experimental settings. Given the
complexity of the observed network, we reasoned that the ability to interactively explore the data would
be superior to static networks, and implemented an online interactive 3D map (http://www.sars-cov-2interactome.org/) which can be used to identify network regions, the distribution of enriched categories
as well as isolate subgroups of interactions or interactors. Considering that BioID bait proteins label
proximal partners within a sphere of ~10 nm radius in living cells, we argue that a data-driven network

topology in three-dimensional space is an excellent representation for capturing viral protein and host
factors organization. We further hypothesize that our analysis defines cellular volumes populated by
identified proteins which are at the core of viral-host interplay.

Together, our data provide an unprecedented coverage of the SARS-CoV-2 proteins interplay with

(e.g. PKP2, POLA1 and POLA21) that are not involved in translation, we identify 12 components of the
eukaryotic translation initiation (eIF) 3 complex uniquely associated with SARS-CoV-2 NSP1. SARS-CoV-1
NSP1 has been reported to block translation through interacting with the 40S ribosomal subunit11, of which
we identified RPS10 as a high confidence interactor. In the previous interactomic studies, very few SARSCoV-2 NSP1 interactors were identified1,2,3. Our data strongly suggest that NSP1 binds to the 40S subunit
through the eIF3 complex, which is well described to modulate translational activity12. Besides interacting
with the 40S associated proteins, we detected the RNA helicase DDX3X which has been involved in innate
immune response activation in HBV13, VACV14, HCV15 and HIV-116 infections. Of note, we observed striking
toxicity expressing N-ter BirA* tagged NSP1, but not with the C-ter tagged version. Data obtained with the
N-ter tagged NSP1 samples are thus only produced through transient transfection, since we were unable
to generate a stable cell line for this construct. In line with this observation, the C-ter tagged version did
capture only 2/12 eIF3 complex components, suggesting that NSP1 is binding to this complex mainly
through its C-ter end, and that an excessive binding of NSP1 to eIF3 complex is detrimental for the cell.
Under poly(I:C) treatment, NSP1 interactome was slightly modified. It gained a few interactors with no
obvious involvement in viral life cycle.

NSP2 uniquely interacts with RIG-I and STAT1 and appears as a central protein in SARS-CoV-2 innate
immune response evasion
Little is known on coronaviruses NSP2 proteins functions. In our analysis, we retrieved 43 (20 in
SARS-CoV1/2 and 23 with
other coronaviruses) reported
interactors, out of 146 total
proximal proteins, including
STAT1 (MHV NSP2 in mouse by
BioID17). Only four SARS-CoV-2
interactors were overlapping
with our dataset (STOML2,

Our

analysis

revealed that NSP2 interacts

with e.g. 28 components assigned to the cytoskeleton organization center, 34 components of plasma
membrane bounded projection, a primary site of virion production18, and 28 components of vesicles. In
addition, NSP2 BioID captured several components of the innate immune response pathways (AZI2,
ZFAND5, NUMBL, USP15, STAT5B, IBTK, CYLD, TRIM26), autophagy key proteins (WIPI1, WIPI2, MAP1LC3B)
and major regulators of apoptosis (e.g. AVEN, TP53BP2, AREL1, BAG3, ZAK, CASP8). Multiple kinases were
also identified (see18), suggesting that NSP2 is an important signaling perturbator in infected cells. NSP2
could thus play a role in modulating cellular response to infection and death signals.
Upon poly(I:C) treatment, the NSP2 interactome was dramatically rewired. About 90 interactors
were enriched/gained under infection-mimicking conditions, including several PPIs connecting NSP2 to
major components of the antiviral response pathways. We thus uncovered the viral RNA sensor RIG-I
(DDX58)19, the IFN response enhancing PARP9, which belongs to the ubiquitin ligase complex with DTX3L20,
the key IFN pathway regulators IFIT1/2/3/521, the signal transducer STAT122, the ubiquitin ligase TRIM5623
and the E3 ISG15 ligase HERC524 as novel NSP2 interactors. NSP2 thus appears as a core modulator of host
cell innate immune response.
NSP3 (PLpro) interacts with translation control factors and ERAD pathway components

classical IP-MS previous reports (MKRN2, RCHY1). Several novel interactors linked to translation control
have been uncovered, e.g. PPP1R15A/B, LTN1 and ZNF598, EIF4E2 and GIGYF2. Besides its function

towards viral polyprotein, our data suggest that NSP3 also associates with microtubule cytoskeleton
dynamics (e.g. SLAIN1, TRIM3, KIF4, MAP7D3). Interestingly, poly(I:C) treatment induces its interaction
with several components of the endoplasmic reticulum-associated degradation (ERAD) pathway, such as
DERL2, HERPUD1, VIMP, and ERLIN1. Through these interactions, PLpro might regulate proper control of
polyprotein translation, folding, transport and stability.
NSP4 interacts with endomembrane proteins and could dysregulate the endocytic degradation pathway
through ITCH, MIB1 and ESCRT-0 complex upon infection
NSP4 is a transmembrane glycoprotein able to form double-membrane large vesicles associated
with the SARS-CoV-1 replication complex28. As shown in Fig.6, N-ter BirA*-tagged NSP4 alone can
recapitulate resembling phenotype, suggesting that our tagging does not impair its ability to form such
structure. In line with previous report29, we identified nuclear envelope interactors, mitochondrial
associated factors and ER factors. Of note, given the membranous nature of NSP4, the BioID approach
identified many novel membrane-associated interactors compared to classical IP-MS techniques. Our rich
NSP4 interactome data revealed associations between e.g. NSP4 and the Golgi apparatus membrane,
numerous vesicular complexes (e.g. TRAPP, SNAREs, ESCRT-0), organelle membrane contact site

several hits of particular interest,

e.g. PRKCQ (Protein kinase C theta type; involved in NFB signaling30), ITCH (E3 ubiquitin-protein ligase
Itchy homolog) and MIB1 (Mindbomb E3 ubiquitin protein ligase 1). ITCH is a major regulator of

inflammatory and antiviral pathways. It has been e.g. reported to trigger MAVS degradation31 and control
NOTCH1 degradation32. Interestingly, it also ubiquitinylates the chemokine receptor CXCR433, and directs
it towards the degradative endocytic pathway targeting HGS and STAM (ESCRT-0 complex components).
MIB1 is reported to interact with Notch receptor and regulates the internalization of Notch ligand. NSP4,
through interacting with trafficking machineries, appears as a main host membrane remodeler and could
also impair membrane embedded protein homeostasis upon SARS-CoV-2 infection.
NSP5 (3CLPro) BioID did not identify interactors enriched in specific mechanisms
The NSP5 protease (3CLPro) is the main factor
processing the Orf1a/b-encoded polyproteins34. It
is therefore an essential protein for virus protein
maturation. However, our analysis only identified
14 high confidence NSP5 interactors, and we did

SARS-CoV-1 NSP6 has been

previously reported interactors,
including two components of the

GPI-anchor transamidase complex (GPAA1 and PIGS). NSP6 proximal interactome is greatly enriched in
membrane proteins (201/251), mostly from ER, mitochondria, Golgi and vesicles. Our data also uncover
e.g. peroxisome core components (SLC25A17, PEX5, PEX11B and PEX14) and several autophagy-related
proteins, including SQSTM1, which supports previous findings (by homology35). We detected 11
components of the NADH oxidoreductase complex, BAX, DIABLO, MFF, potentially involving NSP6 in
mitochondrial respiration, apoptosis and mitochondrial fission/fusion. Our experiments also allowed the
detection of several components linked to immunity response: UNC93B1, TOLLIP, ZC3HAV1, TAX1BP1,
CYLD, TMEM9B, C1QBP and NPLOC4. UNC93B1 regulates several Toll-like receptors (TLRs) addressing from
the ER to the endolysosome where they recognize pathogens and activates innate and adaptative immune
pathways36. TOLLIP (Toll-interacting protein) is involved in TLR and IL-1 signaling, and acts as an adapter
between ATG8 and ubiquitinated substrates, playing a major role in clearing protein aggregates37.
ZC3HAV1 (or ZAP, Zinc finger CCCH-type antiviral protein 1) induces the recruitment of host RNA
degradation machinery to the viral RNA38. It also positively regulates RIG-I downstream signaling, which
activates IRF3 and triggers the expression of type I IFN stimulated genes (ISGs)39. TAX1BP1 is also involved

in TNF, IL-1 and NFB signaling40. CYLD is involved in inflammation and innate immune response through
its ability of inhibiting NFB nuclear translocation41. TMEM9B is a key regulator of proinflammatory
cytokines production in response to TNF, IL-1 and TLR ligands42. The Complement component 1 Q
subcomponent-binding protein (C1QBP, or gC1qR) is a multifunctional protein thought to be involved in
regulation of antiviral response by inhibiting RIG-I and IFIH1-mediated signaling pathways, probably
through its association with MAVS after viral infection43. NPLOC4 acts as a negative regulator of type I IFN
production via the complex formed with VCP and UFD1, which binds to RIG-I and recruits RNF125 to
promote ubiquitination and degradation of RIG-I44. Together, these data suggest a central and versatile
role of NSP6, and potentially link this viral protein to TLRs, NFB and IL-1 signaling, apoptosis and
autophagy. Poly(I:C) treatment induces NSP6 interactions with several factors involved in autophagy
(SQSTM1, FAM134A, STX17), Notch (MIB2) and antigen processing (TAP2) pathways. Being associated with
multiple membranes, NSP6 is at the core of a nexus of fundamental signaling processes.
NSP7 interacts with centrosome, microtubule cytoskeleton, vesicular trafficking machineries, nuclear
factors, and could regulate TLR downstream signaling
According to SARS-CoV-1 studies, NSP7 is a subunit of the SARS-CoV-2 NSP7-NSP8 heterotetramer

cell vesicular trafficking. Interestingly, whereas both N- and C-ter tagged NSP7 detected interactions with
cytoskeletal components, only the C-ter tagged form labeled nucleoplasmic proteins (N-terminally tagged
form showed in Fig. 9). This observation suggests that a non-canonical nuclear localization sequence (NLS)
could be localized in the N-ter region of NSP7 (impaired by the N-ter tag), or that NSP7 can be cleaved,
with a C-ter fragment translocated in the nucleus. This discrepancy is quite uncommon for a nonmembrane associated protein, and further experiments are required to elucidate the molecular etiology.
NSP7 nuclear interactors were essentially involved in DNA-templated transcription, DNA repair, mRNA
processing and histone modification. These results suggest that NSP7 could impair host mRNA production,
thus precluding proper antiviral transcriptional program and/or reducing the pool of endogenous mRNA
(i.e. lighten host mRNA translational burden and enhance host cell capacity for viral RNAs translation). The
C-ter tagged NSP7 also specifically captured important innate immune and inflammatory responses
modulators under basal culture conditions, such as HERC5, PPM1B, TRIM56 and TBK1. Of interest, TBK1
(Serine/threonine-protein kinase TBK1) is activated by TLR following viral or bacterial sensing. TBK1 then
associates with TANK and TRAF3 and phosphorylates the IFN regulatory factors 3 and 7 (IRF3 and IRF7).
These modifications lead to the activation of pro-inflammatory and antiviral genes, including type I IFN46–

might indicate an association with DNA that is in line with the observed localization of NSP8 interactors in

No previously reported NSP10 interactors were identified in our analysis. According to our
immunostaining, more than half of NSP10 BioID interactors are nuclear, including chromatin remodelers,
transcription factors and RNA processing proteins. Surprisingly, N-ter BioID tagged NSP10 did not localize
in the nucleus. We thus hypothesize it could interfere with nuclear factors either which shuttle to the
nucleus or upon mitosis. Of note, NSP10 detected TLE1, an inhibitor of NFB regulated gene expression53
and AZI2 (or NAP1), another regulator of NFB-dependent antiviral innate immune response54. Alike NSP7-

to interpret. Poly(I:C) treatment did not induce noticeable gains of NSP10 interactors.
NSP12 (RdRp) associates with RNA polymerase cofactors, but also with antiviral and inflammatory
signaling proteins
NSP12 is an RdRp binding NSP7-NSP855. Due to its crucial function in viral RNA replication56, NSP12
is a target of choice for antiviral therapeutic strategies. Tremendous efforts have thus been deployed to
target this RNA polymerase, and several clinical assays (e.g. Remdesivir57) are in process to reposition

antiviral drugs and combat COVID-19 severity. It is thus of the utmost importance to finely characterize its
interactors to provide further knowledge in how this viral protein behaves in host cells. Our BioID
experiments identified microtubule-associated proteins (centrosomal, centriolar satellite and cilia), RNAmediated gene silencing machinery (AGO2, TNRC6A, TNRC6B), chaperones (e.g. CCT2/5/6A/8, FKBP4,
DNAJC7, HSP90A1/A1B/A8, VBP1, PFDN1/2/4/5/6), anaphase-promoting complex components
(ANAPC1/4/5/7/13/16, CDC16/23/27), phosphatidylinositol regulating proteins (PIK3R2, PIKFYVE, INPPL1)
and JNK/MAPK signaling pathway regulators (e.g. MAP3K7, PEAK1). In addition to these enriched
categories, several proteins associated with RNA polymerases were identified: POLR2E/L, RPAP3, INTS4/7,

PIH1D1, ENDOG and URI1, CPSF3, CSTF2T. They represent either candidate cofactors recruited to enhance
NSP12 activity or proteins targeted to impair host transcription. Several proximal interactors are also likely

enrichment analysis, regardless of the poly(I:C) treatment. Importantly, a recent functional study has
suggested that SARS-CoV-2 NSP13 is an IFN signaling antagonist63. However, we did not detect any NSP13

molecular context. Future experiments in SARS-CoV-2 infected cells will reveal additional and
pathologically relevant interactions of this essential viral protein.
NSP14 associates with RNA decapping and deadenylation host factors
NSP14 is a component of the replication-transcription complex. It is a dual functional enzyme,

Through these partners, NSP14 could interfere with RNA decapping and deadenylation, two processes
leading to mRNA degradation. Further experiments are needed to get precise insights on how NSP14
functions, particularly performing interactomic studies in infected cells, or at least in cells expressing its
viral cofactor NSP10. NSP14 uniquely interacts with TRAF7, an E3 ubiquitin ligase involved in NFB
activation65. Upon poly(I:C) stimulation, we detected an interaction between NSP14 and CEP97/152/192,

three proteins involved in ciliary basal body docking to the plasma membrane. The enriched interactions
with machineries leading to mRNA degradation could explain why NSP14 was also identified as an IFN
response antagonist63. We could hypothesize that NSP14 could either sequester host decapping and
deadenylation machineries or stimulate host mRNA degradation.

(PFDN1/2/4/5/6, VBP1), nonsense mediated mRNA decay factors (SMG5/6/7/9), and actin cytoskeleton
associated components. Since NSP15 has also been reported as impairing adequate innate immune
response, we focused our analysis on host-factors linked to these mechanisms. Our dataset reveals novel
interactions between NSP15 and RIPK1, TAB1, TAB2, TRAF3IP2 (CIKS) and XIAP. These proteins are
activated downstream TLR activation and/or are involved in the IL-17 signaling pathway. Across our
dataset, DIABLO and HTRA2 were identified as NSP15 high confidence proximal interactors, potentially
linking NSP15 to apoptosis regulation. Beyond its EndoU reported function, our data strongly suggest that
NSP15 impacts host cell innate immune signaling and apoptosis, interfering with signal transducers
downstream TLRs and DIABLO/XIAP/HTRA2, respectively. Under poly(I:C) stimulation, NSP15 gained a
handful of interactors, but none with infection-related function. Together, our data shed a new light on
how NSP15 could interfere with host innate immune response and suggest its involvement in apoptotic
pathway deregulations.

DCP1A and PATL1 are interesting candidates to link NSP16 to mRNA capping process. In addition, NSP16
uniquely identify the p100 NFB subunit (NFKB1), which could lead to defect in NFB signaling or transport
into the nucleus. Together with the detected nucleopore components, NSP16 interactions with NFB

APC69, nuclear pore components (NUP37/98/107/133/L1) strongly suggest that NSP16 could generally
interfere with the nuclear translocation of transcription factors following activation of several activating
pathways. Poly(I:C) stimulation induces interactions with DTX3L-PARP9, additionally linking NSP16 to IFN
response regulation20. Our data thus open numerous hypothesis on additional roles of NSP16 towards
several signaling pathways, including antiviral response.

remain largely unknown. It is reported that S can accumulate at the ER-Golgi intermediate compartment,
where it participates in virus assembly72. Eventually, S oligomers might be transported to the plasma
membrane and promote cell-cell fusion73. Expectedly, we identified S proximal interactors mostly assigned

to ER, Golgi, endosome and plasma membranes. The C-ter tagged version of S provided the richest results,
suggesting that the N-ter tag impairs proper S addressing (probably through masking the signal peptide or
because of the BioID-tag cleavage from the fusion). We identified two previously reported interactors of
S: EZR and ZDHHC5. Of note, we identified 12 factors involved in virus entry mechanisms. We detected
highly specific interaction of S with four components of the Ragulator complex (LAMTOR1/2/3/5). S BioID
detected PPP1R16B, CSPG4, and JUP, which are all involved in endothelial cell adherence and motility.
Additionally, S is in proximity of multiple factors involved in cell-cell and cell-matrix adhesion (e.g. JAM3,
CASK, EPB41L4B, FLRT3, FLOT2, CD44, TENM3), lamellipodium (e.g. ROCK1, RDX, PKN2) and migration

(MARCKS, ROBO1/2, DAG1). This set of interaction could be related to the recently reported SARS-CoV-2driven induction of cellular extension/pseudopodia, which are thought to facilitate cell-to-cell virus
spreading18. Finally, S interacts with several factors involved in inflammation and innate immunity
regulation, such as ITCH, TOLLIP, HGS and a set of kinases involved in NFB activation (PRKCI74, PRKD175,
PRKCQ). Poly(I:C) pre-stimulation did not induce any noticeable interaction.
ORF3a interacts with vesicular sorting and fusion machineries, and could impact a plethora of
membrane proteins, such as receptors involved in thrombosis, type II IFN, NFB and IL-6 signaling.

infection, it plays a role in virulence78. We identified 11 previously reported SARS-CoV-1/2 interactors. Our
N-terminally tagged ORF3a BioID dataset is enriched in ER stress response and misfolded protein pathway,
probably reflecting a processing impairment due to the tag positioning. Over 80% of ORF3a interactors are

related to membranes, mostly Golgi, plasma membrane and vesicles. ORF3a detects 7 components of the
SNARE complex (NAPA, STX4/6/7/12/16 and SNAP23) and uniquely interacts with 12 components of the
TRAPP complex (TRAPPC1/2/2L/3/4/5/6B/8/9/10/11/12).

Several CORVET and HOPS complex

components were also identified (VPS8/16/18/33A/39/41). The SNARE complex is involved in membrane
trafficking and fusion79; the TRAPP complex in tethering vesicle transported from ER to Golgi80; and the
HOPS and CORVET complexes in vacuolar, late endosomal and lysosomal membranes tethering and
fusion81. These data strongly suggest that ORF3a acts as a major regulator of endosomal and membrane
trafficking by interfering with vesicular membrane attachment machineries. Through interacting with

endosomal addressing machinery, ORF3a potentially impacts the fate of a plethora of membranes and
their embedded proteins. Among interactors potentially related to reported ORF3a functions and COVID19 symptoms, we identified: NUMBL, TNFRSF10B, SCRIB, UNC5B, SRC, ADAM9, IL6ST, TOLLIP, ROR1, and
PTPRJ. The Numb-like protein (NUMBL) inhibits the NFB pathway, inducing TRAF6 degradation82.

adhesion and cytokine receptors86. Of note, we detected other related kinases, such as LYN and YES1. LYN
is involved in innate and adaptative immune responses, transducing signal downstream e.g. TLR2/4/6,
cytokine receptors (CXCR4, receptors for IL-3, IL-5, CSF2) and growth factors in platelets, neutrophils and
eosinophils (e.g.

87,88

). ADAM9 (Disintegrin and metalloproteinase domain-containing protein 9) cleaves

multiple substrates involved in angiogenesis, may act as an alpha secretase for APP and has been involved
in viral infection mechanisms89. IL6ST (Interleukin-6 receptor subunit beta) is involved in transducing
multiple signals, such as IL-6 and IL-11, and might be crucial in severe COVID-19 cases90. ROR1 (Inactive
tyrosine-protein kinase transmembrane receptor ROR1) acts as a receptor, and when activated by WNT5A
ligand binding, activates NFB signaling91. Finally, PTPRJ (Receptor-type tyrosine-protein phosphatase eta;
CD148) regulates endothelial cell survival, enhancing epithelial cell junctions as well as VEGF-induced SRC
and AKT activation92. PTRJ has also been reported as activating platelets and triggering thrombosis (as well
as F11R)93. These interactors suggest a central role of ORF3a in dysregulating membrane receptorcontaining endosomes, which could lead to the alteration of multiple pathways such as apoptosis signaling,
innate and adaptative immune responses and platelet activation. No major interactors gain was observed
in the presence of poly(I:C).

proteins are dedicated to downregulating membrane receptors abundance95. Interestingly, the ESCRT-0
complex has also been involved in IL-2 and GM-CSF/L signal transduction96. ORF3b also identified multiple
components of the SNARE complex, but did not detect HOPS, CORVET or TRAPP complexes subunits,
highlighting their differential involvement of ORF3a and ORF3b in SARS-CoV-2 pathogenesis. Amongst
noticeable proximal interactors, ORF3b identified: RalA, LYN, ALCAM and TMF1. RalA (Ras-related protein
Ral-A) is a GTPase involved in multiple mechanisms, including membrane trafficking, exocytosis and
filipodium assembly97. ALCAM (Activated leukocyte cell adhesion molecule, CD166) is a cell-cell adherence
membrane protein contacting CD6 on T-cells, thus contributing in forming the immunological synapse. It
has also been reported to mediate dendritic cell attachment to endothelial cells through homotypic
interactions98. TMF1 (TATA element modulatory factor 1) has been reported to mediate STAT3
degradation and could be involved in RAB6-dependent vesicular transport from endosome to Golgi and
from Golgi to ER99. Upon poly(I:C) pre-treatment, ORF3b gained several interactors, including USP11 which
displays an inhibitory activity on the NFB pathway100. Interestingly, stimulating the innate immune
response resulted in a massive loss of ORF3b interaction, suggesting that ORF3b alone is not enough to
counteract the antiviral response, which seems to disrupt its function.

hijacking host cell mechanisms. E is a short transmembrane protein localized at the site of intracellular
trafficking (ER, Golgi, ER-Golgi intermediate compartment - ERGIC). Expectedly, given its strong membrane
association, we did not detect any overlapping interactors with previous reports1,2,3. Most E proximal
interactors were localized at the ER, ERGIC or Golgi membranes. Other categories such as lipid metabolic
process or ion membrane transport were also highly enriched. Interactors associated to e.g. vacuole and
mitochondria suggest that E could actively participate in recruiting membranes and lipid processing
machineries at the virion assembly site to provide suitable lipids for viral particle assembly. Amongst 226
identified proteins, BioID revealed high confidence interactions between E and: C1QBP (coagulation102,
inflammation103, infection and apoptotic processes104), TMEM59 (autophagy105), TMEM9B (enhances TNF,
IL-1B, IL-6 and TLR ligand production; involved in NFB and MAPK pathways activation42),
BTN2A2/3A2/3A3 (IL-2 and type II IFN regulation106, inhibits type II IFN (IFN) release and T cell
regulation107, respectively), TGFBR1 (TGF main receptor, involved in cell homeostasis and apoptosis
regulation108). E also detected KCNJ8/11, two subunits of the ATP-sensitive potassium channels (KATP)
which is involved in cardiac and smooth muscle regulation (see109 for review). Together, our data suggest
that E plays a role in recruiting fatty acids sources for viral assembly, and could impact ceramide,
cholesterol and glycosylation pathways to make them suitable for virion envelope constraints. The

putative links between E and coagulation (C1QBP) and cardiac muscle regulation proteins (KCNJ8/11) is
also of interest considering the atypical COVID-19 frostbite-like skin rashes. Poly(I:C) pretreatment induced

previously reported interactors of

M1,2,3.
Our M BioID data are highly enriched in membrane proteins (ER, Golgi, ERGIC, plasma membrane). Given
the complexity of M proximal interactome and to narrow down our analysis to groups of interactors likely
to be related to M functions, we decided to focus on M interactions detected by at most three viral bait
proteins. Amongst these 198 highly specific interactors, we identified e.g.: 37 cell junction proteins; 32
lipid binding proteins; 12 hits related to actin cytoskeleton organization; 14 proteins regulating
phosphatidylinositol metabolism; four components of the AP-1 complex (AP1B1/G1/M1/S2); ten
components regulating the MAPK activity. These interactions already suggest a much wider involvement
of M in the SARS-CoV-2 viral life cycle than suspected so far. We also detected highly specific interactors
(detected by ≤3 viral bait proteins) potentially linking M to COVID-19 related processes, such as: PRKD2,
ERBB2IP, IL6ST, TBC1D23, B2M, ADD1/2/3, EHD1, EHD4, SNXs, FCHO2, and SH3GL3. The Serine/threonineprotein kinase D2 (PRKD2) is a regulator of the MAPK, NFB and cytokine production pathways113. ERBB2IP
(Erbb2-interacting protein) inhibits NOD2-dependent NFB signaling and proinflammatory cytokine
secretion114. TBC1D23 (TBC1 domain family member 23, also known as HCV non-structural protein 4Atransactivated protein 1) may act as a general inhibitor of innate immunity signaling, strongly inhibiting
multiple TLR and dectin/CLEC7A-signaling pathways115. B2M (Beta-2-microglobulin) is a component of the

MHC-I and is thus involved in antigen peptide presentation116. ADD1/2 are alpha- and beta-adducin,
respectively, and are responsible of membrane-cytoskeleton binding and involved in spectrin-actin
assembly117. EHD1 and EHD4 (EH domain-containing protein 1 and 4) control membrane tubulation in an
ATP hydrolysis-dependent manner118. SNX1/2 (Sorting nexins 1 and 2) are involved in retromer transport
and in sensing membrane curvature119,120. FCHO2 (F-BAR domain only protein 2) can recruit membranes
and modify their curvature as well121. Finally, SH3GL3 (Endophilin A3) has been reported to recruit other
proteins to membranes with high curvature122. Together, these data show that M can impact diverse
pathways, such as MAPK, NFB, innate immunity, antigen presentation and membrane curvature
regulation. This later process is of interest since M is known to regulate virion membrane shaping123.
Membrane curvature depends of lipid composition and a nexus of regulation involving proteins such as
those cited beforehand (containing a BAR-domain to regulate curvature), cytoskeleton-membrane
attachment proteins (ADD1/2) to push membranes, form necks and allow budding. Upon poly(I:C)
induction, specific interactors were gained including five heat shock proteins, two components of the
ESCRT-0 complex, and three BAG-domain containing proteins (BAG2/4/5). The other noticeable
interactors were IFIT1 and TAP2 (Peptide transporter involved in antigen processing 2), a protein involved
in the assembly of the antigen peptide to the MHC-I. Along with TAP1 (detected in basal culture

conditions), it forms the tapasin complex, which is targeted by multiple viruses as a strategy to impair
antigen peptide presentation and escape immune system activation124,125. Our data suggest that M recruits
specific membrane remodeling components of the host machinery to allow virion formation. It could also
be involved in the regulation of the pathways mentioned hereabove.
ORF6 uniquely captures the CCC complex, several components of the nucleopore inner channel, and
could thus impair host cell proper innate immune response
ORF6 is an accessory protein shown to inhibit IFN signaling through disrupting karyopherindependent nuclear translocation of transcription factors such as STAT1 (by homology with SARS-CoV1)126,127. A recent study also characterizes SARS-CoV-2 ORF6 as a potent inhibitor of IFN and NFB
pathways and IFN stimulated genes such as ISG54 and ISG56, which together, make ORF6 a major
antagonist of innate immune response128. Unexpectedly, our BioID experiments did not identified ORF6
specific high confidence interactors when the tag was positioned at the C-terminal end. We identified four
previously reported interactors of ORF6 (DCTN2, NUP98, RAE1 and KPNA2). KPNA2 has been previously
associated with SARS-CoV-1 ORF6 immune escape mechanism126,127, impairing STAT1 nuclear import. ORF6
BioID identified different interactor groups: 18 components of the nucleopore, including four out of six

detected (NUP62/214), which is in

line with the CoV-1 ORF6 reported function of impairing transcription factors nuclear import126,127.
Likewise, ORF6 was the sole bait to detect the CCC complex components. Besides its reported role on
cholesterol, several CCC complex components have been shown to downregulate NFB, promoting its
ubiquitination and subsequent degradation131. ORF6 identified several peroxisomal (ABCD3, PEX19,
PEX11B) and mitochondrial outer membrane proteins (TOMM70A, USP30, ARMCX3, MFF, DNML1, AKAP1,
BCL2L13). In addition, ORF6 identified additional factors which could also contribute to its antagonizing
role on innate immune response: TBK1 and MAVS, the antiviral signaling adaptor protein downstream RIGI and MDA5132,133. Induction of IFN response through poly(I:C) induced the ORF6-TRIM56 proximal

interaction, which could provide another key regulation layer on innate immune response. It also induces
interactions with five 26s proteasome components, suggesting a putative involvement of ORF6 in targeting
innate immune response factors to degradation. Taken together, our data show that ORF6 interacts with
specific components of the nucleopore complex, probably impairing nuclear translocation of transcription
factors driving innate immune response program, and uniquely identify the CCC complex, which can target
NFB for degradation. The interaction with TBK1, MAVS and TRIM56 could indicate another level of
regulation, given their action on the early stages of innate immune pathways activation (downstream RIGI, MDA5, TLR3, STING).

transmembrane transport (58), protein N-linked glycosylation (13), secretion (35), or antigen processing
and presentation (12). Amongst ORF7a proximal interactors linked to innate or adaptative immune
responses, we identified e.g. UNC93B1

(TLR3/7/9 endosome addressing136); BTN3A2/3A3 (T-cell

response and IFN release inhibition); HLA-B, B2M, TAP2 (antigen processing); NCSTN, APH1A, OSTC,
BACE2, TMEM59/59L (Notch and APP related pathways); CD97 (leukocyte adhesion and activation137);
PRKCQ (IL-2 and NFB pathways); SPPL2B (intramembrane cleaving protease; ITM2B138 and TNF
processing139); IKBIP (NFB pathway); NPLOC4- VCP-UFD1L complex (type I IFN inhibitor44); TMEM9B
(enhancer of proinflammatory cytokines in response to IL1, TNF and TLR activation; activator of NFB
and MAPK pathways through TNF stimulation). We also noticed the presence of 6/12 components of the
OST-complex (STT3A, DDOST, OSTC, DAD1, TMEM258, RPN2). GGCX (Vitamin K-dependent gammacarboxylase) is another host-factor of interest, since it could potentially be linked to coagulation
dysfunctions observed in COVID-19140,141. In addition to these proximal interactions of interest, we
identified several factors involved in processes potentially related to anosmia and ageusia symptoms142.
ORF7a identified the REEP proteins which are involved in membrane receptors and/or olfactory receptors

would be that ORF7a drives an olfactory receptor membrane addressing/recycling impairment through
proteolysis or sequestration of one or several REEP protein(s). Together, our data reveal an ORF7a complex
nexus of proximal partners potentially involving this accessory protein in a broad range of mechanisms,
including yet poorly understood pathophysiological mechanisms (hyper clotting, anosmia, ageusia) related
to COVID-19. Upon poly(I:C) induction, ORF7a gained several interactors including TRIM4, an E3 ubiquitin
ligase targeting RIG-I for K63 polyubiquitination, which leads to an augmented IFN signaling activity144.

important inflammatory and antiviral pathways regulators such as ITCH, UNC93B1 and IL6ST. About half
of ORF7b proximal interactors were shared with ORF7a, suggesting these two viral proteins could
cooperate in several mechanisms (e.g. lipid metabolism, immune pathways regulation, vesicular recycling
of membrane receptors, antigen presentation). ORF7b differentially interacts with 232 hits (compared to
ORF7a) highly enriched in cell adhesion (32). Regarding viral infection-related proximal interactors, ORF7b
identified: IL6ST; LIFR (signal transduction; type I cytokine receptor, potentially sharing pathways with
IL6ST146); IL1RAP (interleukin-1 receptor accessory protein); STAM, STAM2, HGS (ESCRT-0 complex; IL-2

(inflammatory signaling pathways). Of note, we detected furin uniquely interacting with ORF7b. Furin plays
a role in S protein-driven membrane fusion process upon early stages of SARS-CoV-2 entry147. Regarding

anosmia symptom, we detected GRID1, the glutamate receptor ionotropic, delta-1, which is essential for
olfactory cells signal transmission148. In summary, ORF7b seems involved in similar mechanisms as ORF7a,
but targets different factors. It seems more specialized in cell adhesion and could act on different
components of olfactory signaling cascades. Following poly(I:C) treatment, ORF7b interactome is greatly
impacted with 91 interactors increased/gained (including e.g. GRID1) and 67 decreased/lost, suggesting a
regulation upon IFN pathway activation. More than half of these gained hits are assigned to the plasma
membrane. Amongst enriched/gained interactors, we identified e.g.: ROBO2, which is involved in olfactory
bulb neuron development149; IFIT1, TOLLIP, BTN3A2/3A3 (immunity); and CD83 (MHC-II antigen
presentation150). ORF7b thus could be involved in multiple host pathway deregulations, such as
inflammation, IFN pathway activation and olfaction.

translation. It is thus expected to achieve “emergency” pro-viral functions to create a cellular environment
suitable for viral replication. In line with previous interactomic analysis, we identified 10 reported
interactors, including G3BP2, CAVIN1 and GSK3A/B and PRKRA as N high confidence proximal interactors.
These data suggest that: N can localize within the stress granules (G3BP2), cytosolic non-membrane
organelles involved in mRNA storage; interact with caveolae formation (CAVIN1); is involved in the Wnt
pathway and/or glycogen metabolism (GSK3A/B); and could interfere with IFN response (PRKRA, or PACT).
Our BioID data also identified eleven RNA or stress granules associated proteins: XRN1 (nucleases);
ZCCHC6 (or TUT7, miRNA regulation); TNRC6B and DICER1 (RNA-mediated gene silencing machinery
cofactors); STAU2; G3BP1; TDRD3 (RNA granules); FAM120A, CPEB4, PTRF, SRP68, SECISBP2 (RNA
transport and/or binding). This is in line with the reported property of N to phase separate with
RNA159.Importantly, N interacts with factors involved in antiviral host response, such as TRIM26, an E3
ubiquitin ligase targeting IRF3 for proteasomal degradation and bridging TBK1 and NEMO during
infection160. In basal condition, N is thus able to interact with RNA binding and processing host-factors,

including several stress granules biogenesis factors. We see these interactions as a viral strategy to either
protect vRNA from host nucleases, or to control vRNA detection by pattern recognition receptors (PRRs),
or to regulate vRNA transcription/replication/translation. The interactions with TRIM26 and PRKRA could
reveal N-mediated inhibition of both IFN and NFB innate immune response pathways. In the poly(I:C)stimulated condition, N captured additional interactors of outstanding interest: EIF2AK2 (PKR) and its
interactors STAU1/2; ANKRD17; TARBP2 and ZNF346; TRIM56; TRIM26; and IFIT1/2/3/5. It appears logical
that N, being the first viral protein released in host cells, directly targets these fundamental innate immune
response proteins. In SARS-CoV-1, N was found to inhibit IFN production interfering with TRIM25, an Ub
E3 ligase mediating RIG-I degradation161. Our data suggest that N SARS-CoV-2 could use additional or
different mechanisms, such as interfering with RIG-I stabilization by binding ANKRD17162, impairing viral
RNA recognition through IFIT1/2/5 inhibition163, and/or precluding RIG-I downstream response targeting
MAVS or IRF3 (IFIT3, TRIM26), and/or, upstream MAVS, blocking the TRIM56-mediated activation of STING
and FAM173A. PKR is an IFN-induced dsRNA-dependent serine/threonine-protein kinase that detects viral
dsRNA to promote multiple proinflammatory cytokines production165. PKR is also able to block
translation164. Together, our data strongly support a central role of N in impairing host antiviral response.
ORF9b interacts with major innate immune pathway factors (MAVS, ISG20) and seems involved in
mitochondrial fusion/fission and mitophagy
SARS-CoV-1 ORF9b is encoded by an alternative open reading frame within N and has been linked to innate
immune response impairment through its ability to target PCBP2 and AIP4 which leads to MAVS, TRAF3
and TRAF6 degradation166. The Kelhr laboratory also reports SARS-CoV-1 ORF9b property of triggering
autophagy in an ATG5-dependent manner when highly expressed166. ORF9b is located at the outer
mitochondrial membrane probably via its interaction with TOMM70A167. This recent study suggests that
the ORF9b-TOMM70A interaction is essential for the type I IFN signaling inhibition role of ORF9b. In our
BioID analysis, we identified TOMM70A amongst the top interactors of ORF9b, and MARK1/2/3 and
DNM1L which were also previously reported1,2,3. Our data greatly expand our current knowledge,
identifying 36 mitochondrial components over 63 high confidence interactors. Within this population, we

detected remarkable interactors such as MAVS, PPM1A, PPM1B (innate immune signaling), PRKAR2A/2B,
USP30, BCL2L13 (mitophagy), MTFR1/1L, MFF, FAM73A and PLD6 (mitochondrial fusion/fission). Our
analysis in basal condition is in line with previous results and identifies novel specific interactors likely to
be involved in ORF9b-induced mitophagy. Of note, we identified several core regulators of mitochondria
fusion/fission, which could be linked to the hyperfused phenotype reported in166 when ORF9b is expressed.
Together, our BioID analysis provides important insight on the molecular environment of ORF9b at the
mitochondrial outer membrane and uncovers specific factors likely to regulate ORF9b-reported processes.
Following poly(I:C) pretreatment, we observed a handful of additional interactions with e.g. BAX, IFIT2,

thus appears as a central interference protein of the innate immune response, both targeting the antiviral
signal transduction through MAVS, and downstream, the IFN stimulated protein ISG20 to counteract host
cell reaction.
ORF14 interacts with rRNA processing pathway components, and chromatin remodeling factors
following poly(I:C) treatment
ORF14 (also named ORF9c) is an accessory protein of unknown function encoded by an alternative
open reading frame of N, downstream ORF9b169. This 73 aa protein has never been studied in SARS-CoV2, and none of the four reported interactors in SARS-CoV-1 have been identified in our BioID experiments.
Whereas the C-ter tagged ORF14 interactome identified proximal interactors mostly localized at the ER
and the mitochondrial membrane, the N-ter tagged bait labeled a majority of nucleolar components,
which is in accordance with BirA*Flag-ORF14 exclusive localization in the nucleus (Fig.29). This discrepancy

Surprisingly, while the defect of ribosomes produced de novo efficiently inhibits the antiviral response, it
did not seem to affect viral life cycle. Further investigation must be implemented to test the ribosome
production rate in SARS-CoV-2 infected cells. In addition to these interactions, N-ter tagged ORF14

detected USP11 which is involved in NFB pathway regulation171. The C-ter tagged ORF14 interactome
includes 37 components of the ER membrane, 35 mitochondrion proteins, four out of five components of
the GPI-anchor transamidase complex, and 53 nuclear proteins (including 22 nucleolar). It also identified
11 components of the mitochondrial respiratory chain I, suggesting a role of ORF14 in oxidative
phosphorylation. C-ter tagged ORF14 also identified several components of the phagocytic vesicle,
including ANXA11, PDIA3, TAP2, RAB8B and UNC93B1. Together, these data suggest that ORF14 uniquely
interferes with rRNA processing. In the presence of poly(I:C), N-ter tagged ORF14 gained interactions with
35 nuclear components involved in chromatin organization (16), transcription regulation (23) and DNA

methylation (ATRX, EHMT1, BEND3 and BAZ2A). Interestingly, SUMO2 was the most enriched interactor
following poly(I:C) treatment. The SUMO system is a major regulator of chromatin compaction172. All
together, these data suggest that ORF14 could impair chromatin remodeling in response to antiviral
pathways activation, hence precluding the induction of innate immune response genes transcription.

ORF10 could associate with chaperonin and prefoldin complexes
ORF10 is a predicted accessory
protein of unknown function169. None of the
nine previously identified SARS-CoV-1 ORF10
interactors were found in our analysis. BioID
identified six chaperonin T complex and five
prefoldin

components,

ribosomal factors. The presence of poly(I:C)
did not induce interaction gain. Overall, the

ORF10 interactome did not allow to infer a

putative function to this predicted protein. The presence of ORF10 upon SARS-CoV-2 infection remains
questionable.
Discussion
As a general note, the high confidence proximal interactions presented here should be taken with
three main cautions: (i) our analysis was performed in HEK293 cells, which do not represent a SARS-CoV2 physiopathological model. However, they are well known to express a broad panel of proteins and are
thus excellent bioreactors to identify possible interactions in living cells. In addition, the range of different
cell types detected as infected by SARS-CoV-2 keep expanding (e.g. 173,174,175,176) . We thus do think that
this apparent limitation could be also seen as an asset of our study; (ii) In our opinion, the main limitation
sits in the expression of a single protein at a time. Knowing that several viral proteins require viral
cofactors, infected context and/or the presence viral RNA to function properly (e.g. NSP10-NSP14 or
NSP10-NSP16), the present analysis almost certainly misses cooperative viral interactions. Similar studies

performed in infected cells will thus bring highly valuable additional information on putative SARS-CoV-2
pathogenesis mechanisms. As an attempt to mimic a physiopathological context, we artificially induced an
anti-viral response by transfecting poly(I:C) and repeating the proximal interactome analysis. These
experiments already revealed novel interactions of the utmost importance; and (iii), the proximal
interactions are not necessarily physical and should therefore be considered as a discovery step
systematically requiring orthogonal or functional validation. However, the proximal interactomics multiple
analysis generated by us and others have been at the basis of fundamental mechanism discoveries,
supporting the validity of the approach for identifying new biology (see 177 for review).

This first proximal interaction mapping of SARS-CoV-2 proteins provides a plethora of novel
research tracks to better understand this virus pathogenesis. Although for a few proteins our approach
did not lead to satisfying results (NSP3, NSP5, NSP8, ORF8 and ORF10), our data clearly assign most of the
viral proteins to specific subcellular locations and pathways. Based on our poly(I:C) specific interactomes,
we identified NSP2, ORF6, N and ORF9b as the main candidates to explain the defects of innate immune
response observed in COVID-19 patients. This study dramatically expands the current knowledge178 or
uncover novel ties between: NSP1 and translation inhibition mechanisms through eIF3 complex
interactions; NSP2 and RIG-I and PARP9-DTX3L, which could inhibit vRNA sensing; NSP4 and inflammation
and membrane receptor recycling; NSP6 and lipid metabolism and autophagy; NSP7 and vesicular
trafficking; NSP9 and mRNA processing; NSP13 and centrosome; NSP14 and RNA decapping and
deadenylation; NSP15 and TLR signaling, mRNA decay and apoptosis; NSP16 and transcription factors
nuclear translocation; Spike and cell adhesion and migration; ORF3a and ORF3b and vesicular sorting and
fusion; E and lipid metabolism and membrane trafficking; M with membrane curvature and innate immune
response regulation; ORF7a and ORF7b and membrane protein recycling, potentially including olfactory
receptors recycling, innate and adaptative immune pathways, and vitamin K regulator; ORF7b in cell
adhesion and viral life cycle; ORF8 and phagocytic vesicle; N and stress granules and major components of

the innate immune response; and ORF9b with antiviral signaling upstream and downstream the IFN-I
pathway; ORF14 with rRNA metabolism.
This ongoing work will be subjected to several follow up studies to confirm the role of selected
SARS-CoV-2 proteins in specific infectious mechanisms. Our interactome will be subjected to cross
validation by orthogonal approaches and mined to identify putative drug targets candidates.

Supplemental Material and Method
Cloning. SARS-CoV-2 viral proteins coding sequences were cloned into pcDNA5 FRT/TO N-ter and C-ter
BirA*Flag vectors by Gateway cloning (as in1) using our collection of Gateway-compatible entry clones as
templates2 (see Supplemental table 4 for sequences). All clones were sequence verified before cotransfection with pOG44 in Flp-In™ T-REx™ HEK293 cells (Thermo Fisher Scientific).
Cell lines and sample generation. BioID samples were prepared as in 3. Briefly, Flp-In™ T-REx™ HEK293
cells were grown in Dulbecco's Modified Eagle's Medium (DMEM, Gibco) supplemented with 10% fetal

bovine serum (FBS, Sigma-Aldrich), GlutaMAX™ and Penicillin-Streptomycin (1x). Using the Flp-In system
(Invitrogen), Flp-In™ T-REx™ HEK293 stably expressing BirA*Flag or FlagBirA* alone (for control samples),
or N- and C-terminally tagged viral bait proteins were generated co-transfecting pOG44 with each pcDNA5
FRT/TO BirA*Flag-viral bait protein sequence plasmid. After selection (DMEM + 10% FBS + P/S + 200 μg/ml
hygromycin B), three independent replicates of two 150 cm2 plates of sub-confluent (60%) cells were
incubated for 24 hrs in complete media supplemented with 1 µg/ml tetracycline (Sigma), 50 µM biotin
(Thermo Fisher Scientific). Cells were collected and pelleted (300 x g, 3 min), washed twice with PBS, and
dried pellets were snap frozen. Each cell pellet was resuspended in 5 ml of lysis buffer (50 mM Tris-HCl pH

7.5, 150 mM NaCl, 1 mM EDTA, 1 mM EGTA, 1% Triton X-100, 0.1% SDS, 1:500 protease inhibitor cocktail
(Sigma-Aldrich), 1:1,000 Turbonuclease (BPS Bioscience) and incubated on an end-over-end rotator at 4°C
for 1 hour, briefly sonicated to disrupt any visible aggregates, then centrifuged at 45,000 x g for 30 min at
4°C. Supernatant was transferred to a fresh 15 mL conical tube. 25 μl of packed, pre-equilibrated
Streptavidin Ultralink Resin (Pierce) were added and the mixture incubated for 3 hours at 4°C with endover-end rotation. Beads were pelleted by centrifugation at 300 x g for 2 min and transferred with 1 mL
of lysis buffer to a fresh Eppendorf tube. Beads were washed once with 1 mL of lysis buffer and twice with
1 mL of 50 mM ammonium bicarbonate (pH=8.3), then transferred in ammonium bicarbonate to a fresh
centrifuge tube and washed two more times with 1 ml of ammonium bicarbonate buffer. Tryptic digestion
was performed by incubating the beads with 1 µg MS-grade TPCK trypsin (Promega, Madison, WI)
dissolved in 200 μl of 50 mM ammonium bicarbonate (pH 8.3) overnight at 37°C. The following morning,
0.5 μg MS-grade TPCK trypsin was added to the beads and incubated 2 additional hours at 37°C. Following
centrifugation at 2,000 x g for 2 min, the supernatant was collected and transferred to a fresh Eppendorf
tube. Two additional washes were performed with 150 µL of 50 mM ammonium bicarbonate and pooled
with the first eluate. The sample was lyophilized and resuspended in buffer A (2% ACN 0.1% formic acid).
1/3rd of each sample was analyzed per mass spectrometer run.

BioID data acquisition. MS samples were prepared from three biological replicates of each bait protein
fused either with a N-terminal or a C-terminal BirA*Flag epitope tag in basal condition or following poly(I:C)
(Sigma-Aldrich; P1530) transfection at 2µg/mL for 5hrs using PolyJet reagent (Signagen) prior to
tetracycline and biotin induction, and analyzed on a Thermo Q-Exactive mass spectrometer. Samples were
separated by online reversed-phase chromatography using a Thermo Scientific Easy-nLC1000 system
equipped with a Proxeon trap column (75 μm ID x 2 cm, 3 µm, Thermo Scientific,) and a C18 packed-tip
column (Acclaim PepMap, 75 µm ID x 50 cm, 2 µm, Thermo Scientific). The digested peptides were
separated using an increasing amount of acetonitrile in 0.1% formic acid from 2 to 30% for 2 hours at a
flow rate of 300 nL/min. A voltage of 2.4 kV was applied by the liquid junction to electrospray the eluent
using the nanospray source. A high-resolution mass spectrometer Q-ExactiveTM Thermo ScientificTM was
coupled to the chromatography system to acquire the 10 most intense ions of MS1 analysis (Top 10) in
data dependent mode. The MS analyses were performed in positive mode at a resolving power of 70,000
FWHM, using an automatic gain control target of 3e6, the default charge state was set at 2 and a maximum
injection time at 120 ms. For full scan MS, the scan range was set between m/z 300 to 1600. For ddMS²,
the scan range was between m/z 200 to 2000, 1 microscan was acquired at 17,500 FWHM, an AGC was set
at 5e4 ions and an isolation window of m/z 4,0 was used.
BioID data analysis. The proteins were identified by comparing all MS/MS data with the Homo sapiens
proteome database (Uniprot, release March 2020, Canonical+Isoforms, comprising 42,360 entries + viral
bait protein sequences added manually), using the MaxQuant software version 1.5.8.3. The digestion
parameters were defined using trypsin with 2 maximum missed cleavages. The oxidation of methionine
and N-terminal protein acetylation were defined as variable modifications. The Label-free quantification
(LFQ) was done keeping the default parameters of the software. As for initial mass tolerance, 6 ppm was
selected for MS mode, and 20 ppm was set for fragmentation data to match MS/MS tolerance. The
identification parameters of the proteins and peptides were performed with a false discovery rate (FDR)
at 1%, and a minimum of 2 unique peptides per protein. The LFQ values from the 30 control runs
(regrouping FlagBirA* and BirA*Flag alone samples, from stable and transiently transfected cell lines, and
w/wo poly(I:C) pretreatment) were collapsed to the three highest values for each given ID. These three
values were defined as the control group for comparison with viral bait proteins triplicates. The statistical
analysis was done by Perseus software (version 1.6.2.3). Briefly, the LFQ intensity of each sample were
downloaded in Perseus and the data matrix was filtered by removing the potential contaminants, reverse
and only identified by site. The data were then transformed using the log2(x) function. Before statistical
analysis, 84 groups (28 bait proteins, N-ter, C-ter and poly(I:C) for each) were defined with 3 replicates per

group. Only preys with detected values in all three replicates of a given viral bait protein were kept for
further analysis. Missing values were then replaced from normal distribution separately for each column.
Two-sample Student’s T-test was then performed comparing all three biological replicates of each bait and
condition against the three controls runs. High confidence proximal interactors were defined by
permutation-based FDR with a cut-off of 0.01. Perseus output with all experimental values is reported in
Supplemental Table 1.
BioID data analysis. The matrix (Supplemental Table 1) shows the average log2 fold change against control
and the corresponding p- and q-values for each bait and condition. The poly(I:C) data were also compared
against control (green font when significant) and against the corresponding condition (N-terminal tag for
all viral bait proteins, except for NSP1). The poly(I:C) column indicates the status of each interaction when
compared to the basal condition. ‘Gained’ and ‘Lost’ are self-explanatory, and ‘Decreased’ and ‘Increased’
were defined when the log2 fc against the basal condition was <(-1) or >(+1), respectively. ‘Unchanged’
corresponds to log2fc values between -1 and +1, and empty cells depict interactors not detected in the
basal and poly(I:C) condition. The InDegree column depicts the number of bait proteins detecting a given
interactor, regardless of the condition (N-ter, C-ter or poly(I:C)). This criterion was chosen to filter out the
most connected interactors (8+), likely to be organelle-specific background not filtered using the BirA*
alone control samples.
Data annotation. Reported interactions/interactors were annotated using the ‘Reported Corona
interactors’ table (Supplemental Table 1). In the ‘High conf. (7 or less baits)’ tab, the reported high
confidence proximal interactions correspond to the (bait-prey) pairs identified either in SARS-CoV1/2 or
other coronaviruses in previous studies (as indicated). The reported interactors only report the preys
which have already been associated with the indicated coronaviruses. The tabs ‘Enrichment basal
condition’ and ‘Enrichment poly(I:C)’ have been generated entering the lists of high confidence proximal
interactors of each viral bait protein in the ToppCluster online tool4 (https://toppcluster.cchmc.org/).
Selected enriched categories for comparison across bait protein proximal interactomes are represented in
Supplemental Figure 1. All interactors individual annotations are shown in Supplemental Table 2, which
was generated using the Metascape annotation tool5 (https://metascape.org/). For the Figures 3-31, the
Metascape Express Analysis report was used to automatically select the functional categories enriched for
each given bait protein. The detail output of the functional enrichment analysis, including the gene list
assigned to each category for each bait protein, are provided in Supplemental Table 3. Finally, each viral

bait protein proximal interactome was manually analyzed through literature and databases curation, and
the noticeable features are reported in the main text.
Confocal microscopy. Each N-ter tagged viral protein expression was inducted by 1µg/mL tetracycline and
50µM biotin for 24 hrs (in basal or poly(I:C) conditions) in stably transfected Flp-In™ T-REx™ HEK293 cells.
Briefly, cells were grown on poly-lysine coated coverslips, rinsed with PBS before fixation with 4%
paraformaldehyde for 15 min at RT. After fixation they were washed 3 times with PBS 0.1% Triton X-100.
Cells were then blocked in PBS 0.01% Triton, 5% bovine serum albumin (BSA) for 30 min at 4°C. Transfected
cells were then incubated overnight at 4°C with monoclonal anti-FLAG M2 mouse antibody (dilution
1:2,000, Sigma-Aldrich). After 3 washes for 10 min with PBS 0.01% Triton X-100, cells were incubated for
1 h at 37 °C with the Alexa Fluor 647-conjugated secondary antibody donkey anti mouse IgG (H+L) (1:2,000,
Thermo Fisher Scientific) and streptavidin-Alexa Fluor 488 (1:20,000; Invitrogen). Cells were rinsed with
PBS and nuclei were stained with 1 μg/ml 4’,6-diamidino-2- phenylindole DAPI (Thermo Fisher Scientific)
in PBS for 5 min. Finally, cells were washed, desalted and mounted using Dako Fluorescent Mounting
Medium (Agilent Dako, Santa Clara, CA, USA). Acquisition was performed on a Zeiss LSM700 confocal
microscope connected to a Zeiss Axiovert 200 M equipped with an EC Plan-Neofluar 40×/1.30 numerical
aperture and an oil immersion objective (Carl Zeiss AG, Oberkochen, Germany). Processing of the images
was performed using Zeiss Zen 2 software and assembled using Adobe Illustrator.
Interactome network setup and visualization. The starting point for constructing the interactome
network is the BioID high confidence PPI data in the form of a list of pairs of bait-target interactors. There
is a total of 28 baits and 2598 targets (modulo isoforms), with 10198 interactions. Based on this data we
construct a graph with interactors and interactions represented by the vertices (nodes) and edges (links)
respectively of a directed graph.. In addition to the observed BioID interactions, we include 3512 extra
edges in the graph, representing the known interactions between targets. Thus, the final graph has a total
of 2626 vertices and 13710 edges.
To visualize this graph, our objective is to determine an optimum placement of the nodes in threedimensional space that would minimize edge crossings and reveal the interactome’s structure to the best
possible extent. We employ a custom, multi-stage, force-directed graph layout algorithm in 3D, based
largely on the algorithm outlined by Hu6. We modulate the strength of the attractive forces in the physical
model with a factor given by the combination of the experimental enrichment ratio results according to

this information is not available (such as the reported target-target interactions) we set this factor equal
to 1. The node 3D coordinates obtained by minimizing the energy of the physical model are fed into code
that creates a 3D visualization of the network by assigning a point to each node and a line connecting a
pair of nodes when there is an interaction between the corresponding proteins. Our code is written in
Python 3.87 and makes use of several modules, primarily: NetworkX8 for graph operations, NumPy9 for
array manipulation and numerical computations, pandas10 for data handling and Plotly11 for visualization.
Online interactive web application. In order to make our results available to the scientific community in
an usable and informative manner, we have implemented a web app accessible at http://www.sars-cov2-interactome.org/, containing the interactive network visualization as well as multiple options for
selecting and filtering the dataset to view subnetworks, providing the ability to focus on particular areas
of interest and explore various levels of detail. In addition, we integrate and overlay information about the
reported status of interactors and interactions with respect to SARS-CoV-1/2 or other coronaviruses, as
well as the previously reported interactions between the targets (Supplemental Table 1 for details, and
main text references 1,2,3,178). The network customization options primarily consist of four layers: the first
layer gives the ability to filter out targets when their total number of interactions with baits exceeds a
configurable threshold, giving the ability to focus on targets of higher specificity in the interactome. At the
same layer the target-target reported interactions can be turned on/off on the network. The second layer
allows the user to select annotations of interest from three main dropdown categories (pathways,
biological processes, cellular components). In the case of multiple selections, the annotations are
combined, and the resulting network is the union of the individual annotated subnetworks. The third layer
applies filtering to the selected network’s edges and nodes: these are based on the interaction’s poly(I:C)
treatment result, the type of reported interaction, the interactors’ reported status, and a filter restricting
to interactions of specific baits of choice. The various filtering criteria in this layer are combined by
intersection, restricting the view to a portion of the nodes and edges of the previously selected
subnetwork that satisfy them all. The last layer of customization refers to mostly cosmetic attributes of
the network visualization, such as the ability to toggle text labels and edges, present a faded view of the
full network in the background (thus giving a better global view of the location of nodes and edges in the
interactome), and display 3D spherical shapes for the interactors (as opposed to flat 2D circular markers),
better representing their physical size and actual location in space. We plan to continually improve the
dashboard by adding useful features in future updates. Integrating with networks from other related
studies in a comparative manner could provide an even more comprehensive resource that could yield

Supplemental Tables legends
Supplemental Table 1. A. High confidence proximal interactors detected by seven or less viral bait
proteins. The number of baits detecting a given prey protein is indicated in the ‘Indegree’ column. The pand q-values are extracted from the Perseus statistical analysis of MaxQuant data (Tab H for details). The
‘mean log2fc’ column represent the ratio between the detected preys in given bait assays against the
control group. The basal condition ‘High confidence’ column indicates hits which are detected as high
confidence proximal interactor in N-terminally and/or C-terminally tagged corresponding bait BioID. The
‘log2fc poly(I:C) vs. basal’ shows the log2 fold LFQ intensities changes between the preys detected after
poly(I:C) treatment enrichment and the corresponding basal condition. Over 1 is considered as either
enrichment or gain (if absent from the basal condition), between 1 and -1 corresponds to unchanged, and
below -1 shows decreased or lost hits. When no value is indicated, it corresponds to interactions not
detected in the poly(I:C) and the corresponding basal condition. The reported interactions columns display
the bait-prey pairs previously identified in the literature (see tab D for details and references and main
reference 178). The reported interactors columns show preys which have been identified associated with
coronaviruses in previous studies (regardless of the viral bait protein). B. Displays all interactions before
indegree filtering. C. Shows the viral baits detection in the BoID experiments. Of note, most of the non-
