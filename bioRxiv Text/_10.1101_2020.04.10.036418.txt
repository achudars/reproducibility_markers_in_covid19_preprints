SUMMARY
The SARS-coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) spike (S) protein mediates entry of SARS-CoV-2
into cells expressing the angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2). The S protein engages
ACE2 through its receptor-binding domain (RBD), an independently folded 197-amino acid
fragment of the 1273-amino acid S-protein protomer. Antibodies to the RBD domain of
SARS-CoV (SARS-CoV-1), a closely related coronavirus which emerged in 2002-2003, have
been shown to potently neutralize SARS-CoV-1 S-protein-mediated entry, and the presence
of anti-RBD antibodies correlates with neutralization in SARS-CoV-2 convalescent sera.
Here we show that immunization with the SARS-CoV-2 RBD elicits a robust neutralizing
antibody response in rodents, comparable to 100 µg/ml of ACE2-Ig, a potent SARS-CoV-2
entry inhibitor. Importantly, anti-sera from immunized animals did not mediate antibodydependent enhancement (ADE) of S-protein-mediated entry under conditions in which Zika
virus ADE was readily observed. These data suggest that an RBD-based vaccine for SARSCoV-2 could be safe and effective.

INTRODUCTION
Coronaviruses are enveloped single-stranded, positive-strand RNA viruses of the family
Corornaviridae (Cui et al., 2019). They divide into four main subgroups: α, β, γ, and δ. At least
seven coronaviruses infect humans: the α-coronaviruses HCoV-229E and HCoV-OC43, and the
β-coronaviruses SARS-CoV (SARS-CoV-1), HCoV-NL63, CoV-HKU1, MERS-CoV, and the
recently described SARS-CoV-2 (nCoV-19), a β-coronavirus closely related to human SARSCoV-1 (79.0% nucleotide identity) and to SARS-CoV-like variants isolated in bats, including batSL-CoV-RaTG13 (96.2% nucleotide identity) (Lu et al., 2020; Menachery et al., 2015; Zhou et
al., 2020). SARS-CoV-2 infection causes mild flu-like symptoms in many patients, but in many
cases develops into an acute pulmonary syndrome (Chen et al., 2020; Zhou et al., 2020). SARSCoV-1 causes severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS), whereas disease associated with SARSCoV-2 has been named COVID-19.
SARS-CoV-2, like SARS-CoV-1, requires expression of the cellular receptor ACE2 to infect cells
(Hoffmann et al., 2020; Li et al., 2003; Walls et al., 2020). ACE2 is a carboxy metalloprotease
that, among its other substrates, cleaves angiotensin I (angiotensin 1-10) and angiotensin II
(angiotensin 1-8), respectively, to angiotensin (1-9) and angiotensin (1-7). In doing so it
counteracts the vasoconstrictive activity of ACE1 (Hamming et al., 2007; Jia, 2016). Although the
catalytic domains of ACE1 and ACE2 are similar, ACE1 inhibitors have no effect on the enzymatic
activity ACE2. Moreover, the proteolytic activity of ACE2 does not contribute to SARS-CoV-1
or, presumably, SARS-CoV-2 entry processes (Li et al., 2003). However interference with ACE2
activity, through S-protein-promoted internalization and degradation, triggered release by cellular
proteases, or loss of ACE2-expressing type II pneumocytes, may contribute to SARS and COVID19 pathology. Although the physiologic role of ACE2 is complex, its activity is described as
protective against acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) caused by many agents (Imai et al.,
2007). However administration of soluble recombinant ACE2, although well tolerated, did not
attenuate acute lung injury in an early clinical study of ARDS unrelated to COVID-19(Khan et al.,
2017).
Entry of SARS-CoV-2 into ACE2-expressing cells is mediated by its spike (S) protein (Hoffmann
et al., 2020; Walls et al., 2020). The coronavirus S protein is a type I viral entry protein similar to
influenza hemagglutinin and the HIV-1 envelope glycoprotein (Figure 1A and 1B) (Li, 2016). Like

these latter entry proteins, the S protein is processed into two domains, S1 and S2 (Walls et al.,
2020). S1 binds ACE2, whereas S2 anchors the S protein to the viral membrane. The SARS-CoV2 S protein has an efficient furin cleavage site at its S1/S2 boundary, and this site is processed in
virus-producing cells (Coutard et al., 2020). In contrast, the SARS-CoV-1 S1/S2 junction is
cleaved by extracellular or target-cell proteases including TMPRSS2 and cathepsin L (Glowacka
et al., 2011; Huang et al., 2006; Millet and Whittaker, 2015). Both S proteins require processing
at a second site, S2’, within the S2 domain to mediate fusion of the viral and target cell membranes
(Belouzard et al., 2009).
The receptor-binding domains (RBDs, also described as SB) of SARS-CoV-1 and SARS-CoV-2
directly bind ACE2 (Figure 1C) (Li et al., 2005; Walls et al., 2020; Wong et al., 2004; Wrapp et
al., 2020). These RBDs are structurally and functionally distinct from the remainder of the S1
domain, and express and fold as independent domains (Wong et al., 2004). Both RBDs are highly
stable and held together by four disulfide bonds. Structural studies of the SARS-CoV-2 RBD
bound to ACE2 have identified a variable region, termed the receptor-binding motif (RBM), which
directly engages ACE2 (Li et al., 2005). This region is divergent between SARS-CoV-1 and
SARS-CoV-2 (Figure 1D) although both RBD bind ACE2 in the same orientation and rely on
conserved, mostly aromatic, residues to engage this receptor. The divergence between the SARSCoV-1 and SARS-CoV-2 RBM domains suggest that this region is subject to ongoing positive
selection from the humoral response in various hosts. Despite this divergence, some antibodies,
notably CR3022, bind both RBD domains (Tian et al., 2020).
Because the S protein is the dominant protein exposed on the virion, and because its activity can
be impeded with antibodies, it is likely the major target of any SARS-CoV-2 vaccine. Soluble
trimeric S proteins, including those stabilized through various mechanisms, have been tested as
SARS-CoV-1 vaccines, and similar approaches are now being taken against SARS-CoV-2 (Chen
et al., 2005; Walls et al., 2020; Wrapp et al., 2020). Another approach, immunizing with the RBD
alone, has been shown to raise potent neutralizing antibodies against SARS-CoV-1 in rodents (He
et al., 2006; He et al., 2004). Although the RBD presents fewer epitopes than the S-protein trimer,
this approach may have key advantages. The RBD is easier to produce, and is less likely to elicit
antibodies against poorly neutralizing but more immunogenic epitopes. In addition, antibodydependent enhancement (ADE) contributes to the pathogenicity of feline coronaviruses (Huisman
et al., 2009; Olsen et al., 1992; Weiss and Scott, 1981), and has been raised as a concern for

vaccines against SARS-CoV-1 (Jaume et al., 2012; Liu et al., 2019; Luo et al., 2018; Wan et al.,
2020; Wang et al., 2016; Wang et al., 2014; Yang et al., 2005; Yip et al., 2016)3. ADE contributes
to the pathology of other viral diseases, notably those caused by flaviviruses, and in those cases,
non-neutralizing antibodies promote more efficient ADE than those which also neutralize
(Dejnirattisai et al., 2010; Halstead and O'Rourke, 1977; Takada and Kawaoka, 2003). Thus the
RBD-elicited antibodies may mediate ADE less efficiently than those recognizing other S-protein
epitopes because they are more likely to be neutralizing.
We accordingly investigated whether the SARS-CoV-2 RBD domain could raise efficient
neutralizing antibodies and whether these antibodies could also mediate ADE. We show that this
RBD raised potently neutralizing antisera in immunized rats and these sera did not mediate ADE
under conditions where Zika-virus ADE was readily observed.
RESULTS
The SARS-CoV-2 RBD, like that of SARS-CoV-1, is exposed in both known states of the Sprotein trimer, namely a closed state where each RBD contacts symmetrically its analogues on the
other protomer (Figure 1A), and an open state (Figure 1B) in which at least one RBD domain is
extended to contact ACE2 (Figure 1C). We have previously shown that the SARS-CoV-1 RBD
folds independently and expresses efficiently, and that an immunoadhesin form of this RBD
neutralized S-protein mediated entry with a 50% inhibitor concentration (IC50) of ~10 nM (Wong
et al., 2004). This construct, RBD-Fc, also efficiently raised antibodies in mice capable of
neutralizing SARS-CoV-1 variants with distinct RBD sequences (He et al., 2006; He et al., 2004).
These previous data raised the possibility that an RBD-based SARS-CoV-2 vaccine could be
effective against virus throughout the current COVID-19 pandemic.
To evaluate this possibility, we produced and purified the SARS-CoV-2 RBD (sequence shown in
Figure 1D), fused to the Fc domain as an expedient for rapid purification. This RBD fusion protein
was conjugated to a Keyhole limpet hemocyanin (KLH) carrier protein and mixed with the AS01
adjuvant formulation now used in at least two human vaccines. This antigen/adjuvant combination
was injected intramuscularly into four female Sprague-Dawley rats with a schedule of seven
increasing (2.5-fold) doses, one each day, ultimately administering a total of 500 µg of the SARSCoV RBD-Fc. Thirty days after the first administration, RBD fused to a 4-amino acid C-tag was

purified with a C-tag affinity column, again conjugated to KLH, and the immunization regimen
was repeated. Again a total of 500 µg of RBD was administered.
Blood was harvested from each of the four rats (R15, R16, R17, R18) immediately before
inoculation (day 0), and at 5-day intervals starting at day 10 after the first inoculation. Serial
dilutions of day-0 and day-40 sera were measured for their ability to neutralize retroviruses
pseudotyped with the SARS-CoV-2 S protein (SARS2-PV). To provide a consistent metric for
neutralization potency, these sera were also compared with a mixture of all four day-0 preimmune
sera, further combined with an immunoadhesin form of ACE2 (ACE2-Ig) at concentrations in sera
of 10, 100, and 1000 µg/ml before dilution. As anticipated, some baseline inhibition could be
observed in heat-inactivated rat sera (grey lines in Figure 2A). However day-40 serum from each
rat, obtained after two sets of immunizations, potently neutralized SARS2-PV entry with an
efficiency comparable to or greater than day-0 presera mixed with ACE2-Ig at a 100 µg/ml
concentration (Figure 2A and 2B). Indeed day-40 serum from one of four rats, R16, neutralized as
efficiently as 1 mg/ml of ACE2-Ig mixed into preimmune serum. For context, the concentration
of IgG in rat serum in approximately 12-14 mg/ml (Medesan et al., 1998). ACE2-Ig itself, in the
context of rat presera, appears to have an IC50 of well under 1 µg/ml (10 nM), as a 1620-fold
dilution of 1000 µg/ml ACE2 in preimmune sera neutralized more than 50% of SARS2-PV entry
(Figure 2B). This ACE2-Ig inhibition is greater than what we observed with SARS-CoV-1 (Moore
et al., 2004), consistent with ACE2’s higher affinity for the SARS-CoV-2 RBD (Walls et al., 2020;
Wrapp et al., 2020). We conclude that the SARS-CoV-2 RBD can elicit a neutralizing response in
vaccinated rats comparable to a 100 µg/ml (1 µM) concentration of an inhibitor with a 1 nM IC50.
To further characterize the effects of the two successive sets of immunizations, we compared day0, day-15, and day-40 sera by pooling these sera from all rats, and also compared it with pooled
day-0 serum mixed with 10 and 100 µg/ml ACE2-Ig, diluted as indicated (Figure 1C). Again day40 serum potently neutralized S-protein-mediated entry, with significantly greater efficiency than
day-0 serum mixed with 100 µg/ml ACE2-Ig. At lower dilutions (1:20 and 1:60) day-15 serum
neutralized more efficiently than day-0 serum, somewhere between 10 and 100 µg/ml ACE2 in
preserum. However day-40 serum did not efficiently neutralize retroviruses pseudotyped with
SARS-CoV-1 S protein (SARS1-PV), except at the lowest (1:20) dilution, excluding the
possibility that immunization with a single RBD could protect against SARS-like viruses with

divergent RBD. Finally, to confirm that sera from vaccinated rats neutralized SARS2-PV by
recognizing the SARS-CoV-2 S protein, we used each pooled serum to displace an ACE2-Ig
variant with a rabbit Fc (ACE2-rIg) domain from cells expressing the SARS-CoV-2 S protein
(Figure 2D). The ability of each pooled serum to displace ACE2-rIg correlated with its ability to
neutralize SARS2-PV. Specifically, day-40 sera displaced ACE2-rIg more efficiently than
preimmune sera containing 100 µg/ml ACE2-Ig, and day-15 sera displaced ACE2-rIg more
efficiently than preimmune sera containing 10 µg/ml ACE2-Ig. Thus immunization with SARSCoV-2 RBD elicits antibodies that potently neutralize S-protein mediated entry by directly binding
the S protein.
One concern associated with coronavirus vaccines is the possibility that anti-S-protein antibodies
could increase the efficiency of infection of cells, such as alveolar macrophages, expressing Fc
receptors, for example FcγRI (CD64) or FcγRII (CD32). This undesirable antibody-dependent
enhancement (ADE) has been well characterized in tissue-culture studies of several flaviviruses
including Zika virus (ZIKV) and dengue virus (Shim et al., 2019). To evaluate this possibility for
SARS-CoV-2, SARS2-PV were mixed with pooled day-0 or day-40 serum at the indicated serial
dilutions, and the resulting virus/sera mixtures were incubated with HEK293T cells transfected to
express rat FcγRI. These cells did not express ACE2 and no infection was observed with day-0
preimmune sera nor day-40 immune sera (Figure 3A). To verify that these cells were capable of
mediating ADE, rat anti-ZIKV antisera generated by two different rats and pooled, or day-0
preimmune sera was incubated at the same dilutions with ZIKV virus-like particles (VLP). In
contrast to the absence of effect of day-40 anti-RBD anti-sera on SARS2-PV, anti-ZIKV antisera
at the same concentrations promoted robust ADE (Figure 3B). ADE activity peaked at
approximately a 1/2000 dilution, consistent with competition between ADE and neutralizing
activities of these antisera.
To determine if ADE could be observed in the presence of the SARS-CoV-2 receptor ACE2,
HEK293T cells stably expressing ACE2 were transfected to express rat FcγRI. Day-0 preimmune
sera had no detectable impact on SARS2-PV infection, whereas day-40 serum efficiently
neutralized this infection (Figure 3C). However, Day-40 serum did not promote infection at serum
dilutions at which anti-ZIKV antiserum again promoted robust ADE of ZIKV VLP (Figure 3D).
Thus anti-RBD anti-serum did not promote ADE at serum dilutions and under conditions in which

ZIKV ADE could be easily observed. Finally we confirmed the results shown in Figure 3A and B
using K562 cells that endogenously express FcγRII (Chiofalo et al., 1988). Again, day-40 sera did
not enhance entry SARS-PV entry, but rat anti-ZIKV antisera again robustly promoted ZIKV-VLP
infection (Figure 3E and 3F). Collectively the data of Figure 3 suggest that antibodies elicited by
an RBD-based vaccine are likely to neutralize more efficiently than they would mediate ADE.
DISCUSSION
A vaccine against SARS-CoV-2 should, for several reasons, be easier to generate than those
against many other viruses (Gralinski and Baric, 2015; Li, 2016). First, coronaviruses have
exceptionally large genomes compared to other RNA viruses, and, to avoid error catastrophe, their
viral polymerase has acquired a proof-reading function. Thus any individual gene, for example
that of the S protein, is likely to retain its original sequence over multiple replication cycles.
Second, coronaviruses in general, and clearly SARS-CoV-2 in particular, transmits to a new host
more rapidly than an adaptive immune response can emerge. A likely consequence of this strategy
is that one of its most critical epitopes, namely its RBD, is exposed on the virion (Li, 2016; Walls
et al., 2020; Wong et al., 2004; Wrapp et al., 2020), favoring transmission efficiency over antibody
resistance. Finally, the stability and compactness of the SARS-CoV-1 and SARS-CoV-2 RBD
means that it can be easily manufactured and presented to the immune system using many
production technologies, presentation scaffolds, and delivery systems (Wong et al., 2004).
Many efforts are now underway to develop vaccines based on stabilized soluble trimeric forms of
the S protein ectodomain (Wrapp et al., 2020). It is at this moment unclear whether these S-protein
trimers, RBDs, or some parallel or serial combination thereof, will make better antigens. Recent
studies suggest that neutralization activity of patient sera correlates with its RBD recognition, and
that most neutralizing antibodies bind the RBD (To et al., 2020). It is possible that the remainder
of the S protein presents non-neutralizing epitopes that are more immunogenic than the RBD, and
thus the RBD by itself may elicit antisera that are more neutralizing. However, other antibody
effector functions, including antibody-dependent cell-mediated cytotoxicity (ADCC) and
complement fixation, are more efficiently activated when multiple antibodies bind their target
simultaneously, and these non-neutralizing activities can play important roles in viral control. If
these activities contribute significantly to SARS-CoV-2 prevention, the S-protein trimer may make
a better antigen than the RBD. Alternatively, an optimized combination of both antigens may focus

the immune response to a critical neutralizing epitope while also promoting more efficient
antibody effector functions. A trimer-prime, RBD-boost strategy may even be necessary. For
example, the first available vaccines expressing soluble trimers may be insufficiently effective in
older and immunocompromised individuals. A subsequent RBD-based boost might improve
protection in these individuals.
However, development of a safe coronavirus vaccine is complicated by the possibility that such a
vaccine may contribute to COVID-19 pathology. There are now multiple examples in the literature
whereby a SARS-CoV-1 vaccine can have a deleterious effect in non-human recipients (Jaume et
al., 2012) (Luo et al., 2018; Wang et al., 2016; Yip et al., 2016), and SARS-CoV-1 ADE has been
observed by several groups in cell culture studies (Jaume et al., 2011; Liu et al., 2019; Wan et al.,
2020; Wang et al., 2014; Yang et al., 2005; Yip et al., 2014). ADE is more obvious in feline
coronavirus, where it results in a shift in tropism and increase in disease severity (Huisman et al.,
1998; Huisman et al., 2009; Weiss and Scott, 1981). Although ADE could theoretically be
mediated by multiple mechanisms, the standard paradigm is provided by flaviviruses, most notably
by dengue virus (Takada and Kawaoka, 2003). It is well appreciated that a second dengue virus
infection with a different serotype can result in a hemorrhagic fever. In addition, a dengue-virus
vaccine was reported to increase hospitalizations of vaccinees after their first dengue-virus
exposure (Flipse and Smit, 2015; Tsai et al., 2017). In both cases, the underlying mechanism is
presumed to be enhanced Fc-receptor-mediated internalization of virions bound to antibodies.
As observed with flaviviruses, there is a qualitative difference between ADE mediated by
neutralizing and by non-neutralizing antibodies (Dejnirattisai et al., 2010; Shim et al., 2019;
Takada et al., 2003). In the case of neutralizing antibodies, ADE is a consequence of insufficient
coating of the virion surface, due to lower affinity or concentration of the antibody. If
concentrations or affinity is raised, neutralization dominates. In contrast, ADE mediated by nonneutralizing antibodies increases with increasing concentration. We therefore speculated that it
would be difficult of observe ADE with rat antisera targeting the SARS-CoV-2 RBD, a key
neutralizing epitope. Indeed, although rat anti-Zika virus antisera mediated robust ADE of ZIKV
in two different Fc receptor-expressing cell lines, no ADE of S-protein pseudoviruses was
observed with anti-RBD anti-sera, whether or not the SARS-CoV-2 receptor ACE2 was present.
These data suggest that, at least for RBD-based vaccines, ADE is likely to be less of a concern
than with vaccines against flaviviruses such as ZIKV or dengue viruses. However they do not

exclude ADE mediated by other S-protein epitopes or other mechanisms by which a vaccine can
be deleterious.
A key remaining question is whether these studies, conducted in rodents, imply that an RBD-based
vaccine could be effective in humans. Here experimental details become important. We
immunized rats with an adjuvant system (AS01) already in human use, notably for vaccines for
shingles (ShingrixTM) and malaria (MosquirixTM). The RBD used here was conjugated to a carrier
protein, Keyhole limpet hemocyanin, proven safe over decades in humans (Swaminathan et al.,
2014). However KLH can be problematic for those with shellfish allergies, and alternate scaffolds
for presenting the RBD may be necessary. Rats were immunized with two sets of escalating
inoculations, each administered over seven days. This strategy has been shown to maximize
immune responses against HIV-1 antigens (Tam et al., 2016), but it may not be a practical means
of addressing the current pandemic with a subunit vaccine. That said, the escalating dosage
strategy used here may more accurately reflect the kinetics of an mRNA-delivered vaccine, and
indeed we would argue that an RBD antigen would be a preferable alternative, or at least a useful
complement, to mRNA expression of the S-protein trimer.
However, it remains to be determined whether a more limited number of injections of an RBD
subunit vaccine would raise a protective response. A key point relevant to this question is that the
neutralizing activity elicited in these studies is likely much greater than would be necessary to
prevent a new SARS-CoV-2 infection. Rat antisera on average neutralized more efficiently than
naive sera bearing 100 µg/ml of ACE2-Ig, which itself neutralizes with an IC50 of less than 1
µg/ml, consistent with its activity against infectious SARS-CoV-1 (Moore et al., 2004). To provide
some context for these numbers, eCD4-Ig, an immunoadhesin that emulates HIV-1 viral receptors
and neutralizes with neutralization potency similar to that of ACE2-Ig, affords robust protection
against high-dose intravenous challenges with an HIV-1-like virus when it is present in serum in
the range of 5-10 µg/ml (Gardner et al., 2019; Gardner et al., 2015). Thus it is possible that a less
robust response could still be protective. Perhaps as important as these quantitative considerations,
our data show that the RBD alone is sufficient to elicit a potent neutralizing antibody response. It
remains to be determined whether trimer-based vaccines, or trimer/RBD combinations, can be
more effective, and whether they carry additional safety concerns.

In short, our data suggest that an RBD vaccine could protect many individuals from SARS-CoV2 and that it is unlikely to promote infection through conventional ADE mechanisms. Given the
exposure of this key neutralizing epitope, the ease with which this compact domain can be
produced and presented, and its clear immunogenicity, we propose that the RBD be considered as
a key component of any SARS-CoV-2 vaccine strategy.

Production of SARS-CoV-1 and SARS-CoV-2 pseudoviruses and Zika-virus virus-like
particles
Retroviruses pseudotyped with the SARS-CoV-2 or SARS-CoV-1 S proteins (SARS2-PV,
SARS1-PV) were produced as previously described (Moore et al., 2004) with modest
modifications as described. HEK293T cells were transfected by polyethylenimine (PEI)
transfection at a ratio of 5:5:1 with a plasmid encoding murine leukemia virus (MLV) gag/pol
proteins, a retroviral vector pQCXIX expressing firefly luciferase, and a plasmid expressing the
spike

protein

of

SARS-CoV-1

(GenBank

AY271119)

or

SARS-CoV-2

(GenBank

YP_009724390). Cells were washed 6 hours later, and the culture supernatant containing
pseudoviruses was harvested at 48-72 hours post transfection. Zika virus virus-like particles
(ZIKV-VLP) were produced by transfecting HEK293T cells by the calcium phosphate transfection
method with a ZIKV replicon (strain FS13025, GenBank KU955593.1), whose expression is
controlled by tetracyclin, a plasmid encoding ZIKV capsid, prM, and E proteins (strain FSS13025,
GenBank KU955593.1), and the pTet-On plasmid expressing a reverse Tet-responsive
transcriptional activator (rtTA) at a ratio of 2:1:1. Cells were washed 6 h later and replenished with
fresh media containing 1 μg/ml doxycycline. The VLP-containing culture supernatant was
harvested 48 h post transfection. ZIKV replicon was generated by replacing the region spanning
39th through 763rd amino acids of the polyprotein of a ZIKV molecular clone we previously
generated (Zhang et al., 2018) with Renilla luciferase with the 2A self-cleaving peptide fused at

its C-terminus. This construct contains the tetracyclin-responsive Ptight promoter that drives ZIKV
RNA transcription. The pseudovirus- or VLP-containing culture supernatants were cleared by 0.45
µm filtration. SARS2-PV and ZIKV-VLP titers were assessed by RT-qPCR targeting the CMV
promoter in the retroviral vector pQCXIX and ZIKV NS3 gene, respectively. In some cases,
clarified pseudovirus and VLP stocks were stored at -80oC for long-term storage and reuse.
Generation of human ACE2 expressing cell lines
HEK293T cells expressing human ACE2 (hACE2) were generated by transduction with murine
leukemia virus (MLV) pseudotyped with the vesicular stomatitis virus G protein and expressing
myc-hACE2-c9, as previously described (Wicht et al., 2014). Briefly, HEK293T cells were cotransfected by PEI with three plasmids, pMLV-gag-pol, pCAGGS-VSV-G and pQCXIP-mychACE2-c9 at a ratio of 3:2:1, and medium was refreshed after overnight incubation of transfection
mix. The supernatant with produced virus was harvested 72-hours post transfection and clarified
by passing through 0.45μm filter. 293T-hACE2 cells were selected and maintained with medium
containing puromycin (Sigma). hACE2 expression was confirmed by SARS1-PV and SARS2-PV
entry assays and by immunofluorescence staining using mouse monoclonal antibody recognizing
c-Myc.
Protein Production
Expi293 cells (Thermo-Fisher) were transiently transfected using FectoPRO (Polyplus) with
plasmids encoding SARS-CoV2 RBD with a human or rabbit-Fc fusion or a C-terminal C-tag (EPEA). After 5 days in shaker culture, media were collected and cleared of debris for 10 min at
1,500 g nd filtered using 0.45-µm flasks (Nalgene). Proteins were isolated using MabSelect Sure
(GE Lifesciences) or CaptureSelect C-tagXL (Thermo-Fisher) columns according to the
manufacturers’ instructions. Eluates were buffer exchanged with PBS and concentrated using
Amicon ultra filtration devices (Millipore Sigma) and stored at 4ºC before use..
Immunizations and sera collection
All rats used in these studies were handled and maintained in accordance with NIH guidelines and
approved by Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee (IACUC) of Scripps Research
(Protocol 18-025). Female Sprague Dawley rats were immunized with incremental increasing
doses of antigen over seven days starting at day 0, and boosted with a similar regimen at day 30.

Rats were inoculated in the first set with the SARS-CoV-2 RBD fused to the Fc domain of human
IgG1, and in the second set with the RBD fused to a four amino-acid C-tag. In both cases RBD
fusions were conjugated at a 1:1 ratio to Mariculture keyhole limpet hemocyanin (mcKLH,
Thermo-Fischer Peirce) by 1-ethyl-3-(3-dimethylaminopropyl)carbodiimide hydrochloride (EDC,
Thermo-Fischer Peirce) according to manufactures protocols. Each set of seven injections were
performed in the following manner. RBD-KLH conjugates were administered intramuscularly into
the rear quadriceps. Inoculations were initiated with 2.2 µg RBD-KLH (equivalent to 1.1 µg RBD
antigen) adjuvanted with 0.1 µg MPLA and 0.1 µg QuilA, and this inoculum was increased by
2.55 fold for each of the next six days, administering a total of 500 µg RBD-Ig or RBD-C-tag
fusion protein, and 40 µg of each adjuvant component. Sera were collected before inoculation (day
0 preimmune sera) and every five days starting on 10th day after the first injection. All sera was
heat-inactivated for 30 minutes at 56°C and stored at -80ºC for reuse.
Neutralization studies of SARS-CoV-1 and SARS-CoV-2 pseudoviruses
Individual sera or pooled sera collected at day 0 (pre-immune sera), day 15, and day 40 after the
first inoculation were serially diluted in DMEM. In some cases, day 0 sera were mixed with ACE2Ig to a concentration of 10, 100, or 1000 µg/ml before dilution, and then diluted in the same
manner. Individual, pooled, or pooled-ACE2-Ig sera was mixed with SARS1- or SARS2-PV and
incubated at 37ºC for one hour. One hour later, 104 ACE2-239T cells were added along with
DEAE-Dextran (final concentration 5 µg/ml), and media was exchanged 6 hours later with fresh
media without rat sera. At least two independently mixed replicates were measured for each
experiment. Firefly luciferase activity was measured (Britelight) 48 hours post-infection. All
neutralization studies were performed at least twice with similar results.
Competitive displacement of ACE2-Ig from S-protein expressing cells
Serial dilutions of pooled sera or pooled pre-immune sera mixed with ACE2-Ig (with the human
Fc domain) at initial concentrations of 10, 100 and 1000 µg/mL were then mixed with 1 µg/ml
ACE2-rIg (with a rabbit Fc domain). Independent mixtures were made for each replicate. Pooled
sera and sera mixtures were used to stain HEK293T cells transfected by the jetPRIME Transfection
Reagent (Polyplus) to express the full-length SARS-CoV2 S protein. Specifically, 105 per cells
per well were placed in a 96-well V-bottom plate and incubated for 45 minutes at 4ºC with 100 μl

of the serially diluted sera doped with ACE2-rIg. After washing, cells were stained with anti-rabbit
IgG-Alexa647 antibody for 45 minutes at 4ºC, and mean fluorescence intensities were measured
for each well by flow cytometry.
Measurement of antibody-dependent enhancement
The ability of anti-SARS-CoV-2 RBD immune plasma to mediate antibody-dependent
enhancement (ADE) was measured using HEK293T cells or HEK293T cells stably expressing
human ACE2 (293T-ACE2 cells), transfected using the calcium phosphate transfection method to
express the rat ortholog of FcγRI (CD64). The human monocytic cell line K562 (ATCC CCL243), which endogenously expresses FcγRII, was also used for ADE assays. The RBD immune
sera, collected from four different rats at day 40 after the first immunization, were mixed at an
equal ratio, as was preimmune sera obtained at day 0 from the same rats. As a positive control,
sera from ZIKV-infected rats (rat #13 and #15, distinct from the similarly numbered RBDinoculated rats), was also mixed at an equal ratio. Immune and pre-immune serum samples were
heat inactivated for 30 min at 56°C and serially diluted in DMEM containing 10% heat-inactivated
FBS. SARS2-PV or ZIKV-VLP in 50 µl was preincubated for 1 h at 37°C with 50 µl of diluted
sera and added to the indicated cells plated on the 96 well plates. Two days later, infection levels
were assessed using Luc-Pair Firefly Luciferase HS Assay Kit (Genocopia) for SARS-PV and
Luc-Pair Renilla Luciferase HS Assay Kit (Genocopia) for ZIKV-VLP.
Statistical analyses
The statistical significance of differences between preimmune and immune sera, or ACE2-Ig, in
their abilities to neutralize, bind the S protein, and mediate ADE was analyzed by two-way
ANOVA calculated using GraphPad Prism 8.0. Differences were considered significant at P <
0.05.

FIGURE LEGENDS
Figure 1. The SARS-CoV-2 RBD is a discrete domain of the S protein. The SARS-CoV-2 S
protein trimer has been observed in at least two distinct pre-fusion conformations. (A) A symmetric
state in which all three RBD domains (red, yellow, orange) are embedded symmetrically within
the trimeric S-protein, and (B) a state in which at least one RBD domain (red) extends to interact
with the cellular receptor ACE2. The S protein trimer is also modified by multiple N-linked
glycosylations (green). The ACE2-binding motif of the RBD, termed the receptor-binding motif
(RBM residues 437 to 508) is indicated in blue. (C) The RBD (red) is shown interacting with its
receptor, human ACE2 (grey), and its four disulfide bonds are indicated in green. The RBM region
is again indicated in blue. (D) The sequence of the SARS-CoV-1 and SARS-CoV-2 RBD motifs
are shown aligned. Grey indicates differences between the two RBD, red and red lines indicate
disulfide-linked cysteines, and the blue bar indicates the RBM region.
Figure 2. Immunization with the SARS-CoV-2 RBD elicits potently neutralizing antibodies.
Four female Sprague Dawley rats (R15, R16, R17, R18) were immunized with two sets of
escalating doses of RBD conjugated to keyhole limpet hemocyanin. (A) The indicated dilutions of
preimmune sera (day 0, gray) were compared to dilutions of sera harvested from immunized rats
at day 40, and to the same dilutions of preimmune sera mixed to achieve the indicated ACE2-Ig
concentrations before dilution. Each serum and serum-ACE2-Ig mixture was compared for its
ability to neutralize S-protein-pseudotyped retroviruses (SARS2-PV), by measuring the activity of
a firefly-luciferease reporter expressed by these pseudoviruses. Figure shows entry of SARS2-PV
as a percentage of that observed without added rat serum. Error bars indicate the range of two
neutralization studies. (B) The data from each rat of panel A are averaged for clarity. Error bars
indicate s.e.m., with each rat considered a different experiment. Differences between day-0 and
day-40 serum are significant at all dilutions (P < 0.001; two-way ANOVA). (C) Sera from each
rat was pooled before characterization, and SARS2-PV entry was measured at the indicated
dilutions. Day-0 preimmune sera, day-15 sera, and day-40 sera were compared to day-0 sera mixed
with ACE2-Ig to achieve the indicated concentrations before dilution, and characterized for their
ability to neutralize SARS2-PV. Day 40 sera was also tested for its ability to neutralize SARSCoV-1 pseudoviruses (SARS1-PV) as indicated. Values shown indicate percentage of pseudovirus
entry observed with the same dilution of day-0 preimmune sears. Significant differences compared

to day-0 serum at each dilution are indicated above the bar (* indicates P < 0.05; ** indicates P <
0.01; *** indicates P < 0.005; **** indicates P < 0.001; ns indicates P > 0.05; two-way ANOVA).
Error bars indicate range of two entry assays. (D) Pooled sera and pooled preimmune sera mixed
with the indicated concentrations of ACE2-Ig were further combined with an ACE2-Ig variant
bearing a rabbit-derived Fc domain (ACE2-rIg). Binding of the ACE2-rIg was monitored with an
anti-rabbit Fc secondary antibody as determined by flow cytometry. Error bars indicate the range
of two such measurements. Differences between day-0 and day-40 serum are significant (P <
0.001; two-way ANOVA) at all dilutions.
Figure 3. Anti-RBD antisera does not mediate antibody-dependent enhancement of SARSCoV-2 S protein-mediated entry. (A) HEK293T cells were transfected to express rat FcγRI and
infected with SARS2-PV in the presence of the indicated dilutions of preimmune day 0 or immune
day 40 antisera. (B) Experiments similar to those in panel A except that ZIKV VLP and anti-ZIKV
antisera, also elicited in Sprague Dawley rats, were compared to preimmune sera. (C, D)
Experiments identical to those in panel A and B respectively except that HEK239T cells stably
expressing human ACE2 were again transfected to express rat FcγRI before incubation with
SARS2-PV (C) or ZIKV-VLP (D). (E, F) Experiments identical to A and B, respectively, except
that the pro-monocytic K562 cell line was incubated with SARS2-PV (E) or ZIKV-VLP (F). Error
bars in panels A-F indicate the range of two experiments run in parallel. Significant differences
with day-0 preimmune sera are indicated (**** indicates P<0.001 by two-way ANOVA; ns
indicates not significant).
