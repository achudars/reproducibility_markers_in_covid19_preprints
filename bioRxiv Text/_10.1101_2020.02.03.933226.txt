Abstract
The beginning of 2020 has seen the emergence of COVID-19 outbreak caused by a novel coronavirus,
Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). There is an imminent need to better
understand this new virus and to develop ways to control its spread. In this study, we sought to gain
insights for vaccine design against SARS-CoV-2 by considering the high genetic similarity between
SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV, which caused the outbreak in 2003, and leveraging existing
immunological studies of SARS-CoV. By screening the experimentally-determined SARS-CoV-derived
B cell and T cell epitopes in the immunogenic structural proteins of SARS-CoV, we identified a set of B
cell and T cell epitopes derived from the spike (S) and nucleocapsid (N) proteins that map identically to
SARS-CoV-2 proteins. As no mutation has been observed in these identified epitopes among the
available SARS-CoV-2 sequences (as of 9 February 2020), immune targeting of these epitopes may
potentially offer protection against this novel virus. For the T cell epitopes, we performed a population
coverage analysis of the associated MHC alleles and proposed a set of epitopes that is estimated to
provide broad coverage globally, as well as in China. Our findings provide a screened set of epitopes
that can help guide experimental efforts towards the development of vaccines against SARS-CoV-2.

Introduction
The ongoing outbreak of COVID-19 in the Chinese city of Wuhan (Hubei province) (C. Wang, Horby,
Hayden, & Gao, 2020) and its alarmingly quick transmission to 25 other countries across the world
(Centers-of-Disease-Control-and-Prevention, 2020) resulted in the World Health Organization (WHO)
declaring a global health emergency on 30 January 2020 (World-Health-Organization, 2020b). This
came

just

one

month

after

the

first

reported

case

on

31

December

2019

(https://www.who.int/emergencies/diseases/novel-coronavirus-2019). WHO, in its first emergency
meeting (World-Health-Organization, 2020a), estimated the fatality rate of COVID-19 to be around 4%.
Worldwide collaborative efforts from scientists are underway to understand the novel and rapidly
spreading virus that causes this disease, SARS-CoV-2 (originally tentatively named 2019-nCoV), and
to develop effective interventions for controlling and preventing it (Heymann, 2020; Huang et al., 2020;
Xin Liu & Wang, 2020; Zhou et al., 2020).

Coronaviruses are positive-sense single-stranded RNA viruses belonging to the family Coronaviridae.
These viruses mostly infect animals, including birds and mammals. In humans, they generally cause
mild respiratory infections, such as those observed in the common cold. However, some recent human
coronavirus infections have resulted in lethal endemics, which include the SARS (Severe Acute
Respiratory Syndrome) and MERS (Middle East Respiratory Syndrome) endemics. Both of these are
caused by zoonotic coronaviruses that belong to the genus Betacoronavirus within Coronaviridae.
SARS-CoV originated from Southern China and caused an endemic in 2003. A total of 8,098 cases of
SARS were reported globally, including 774 associated deaths, and an estimated case-fatality rate of
14-15% (https://www.who.int/csr/sars/archive/2003_05_07a/en/). The first case of MERS occurred in
Saudi Arabia in 2012. Since then, a total of 2,494 cases of infection have been reported, including 858
associated

deaths,

and

an

estimated

high

case-fatality

rate

of

34.4%

(https://www.who.int/emergencies/mers-cov/en/). While no case of SARS-CoV infection has been
reported since 2004, MERS-CoV has been around since 2012 and has caused multiple sporadic
outbreaks in different countries.

Like SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, the recent SARS-CoV-2 belongs to the Betacoronavirus genus (Lu
et al., 2020). It has a genome size of ~30 kilobases which, like other coronaviruses, encodes for multiple
structural and non-structural proteins. The structural proteins include the spike (S) protein, the envelope
(E) protein, the membrane (M) protein, and the nucleocapsid (N) protein. With SARS-CoV-2 being
discovered very recently, there is currently a lack of immunological information available about the virus
(e.g., information about immunogenic epitopes eliciting antibody or T cell responses). Preliminary
studies suggest that SARS-CoV-2 is quite similar to SARS-CoV based on the full-length genome
phylogenetic analysis (Lu et al., 2020; Zhou et al., 2020), and the putatively similar cell entry mechanism
and human cell receptor usage (Hoffmann et al., 2020; Letko & Munster, 2020; Zhou et al., 2020). Due
to this apparent similarity between the two viruses, previous research that has provided an

understanding of protective immune responses against SARS-CoV may potentially be leveraged to aid
vaccine development for SARS-CoV-2.

Various reports related to SARS-CoV suggest a protective role of both humoral and cell-mediated
immune responses. For the former case, antibody responses generated against the S protein, the most
exposed protein of SARS-CoV, have been shown to protect from infection in mouse models (Deming
et al., 2006; Graham et al., 2012; Yang et al., 2004). In addition, multiple studies have shown that
antibodies generated against the N protein of SARS-CoV, a highly immunogenic and abundantly
expressed protein during infection (Lin et al., 2003), were particularly prevalent in SARS-CoV-infected
patients (X Liu et al., 2004; J. Wang et al., 2003). While being effective, the antibody response was
found to be short-lived in convalescent SARS-CoV patients (Tang et al., 2011). In contrast, T cell
responses have been shown to provide long-term protection (Fan et al., 2009; Peng et al., 2006; Tang
et al., 2011), even up to 11 years post-infection (Ng et al., 2016), and thus has attracted more interest
for a prospective vaccine against SARS-CoV [reviewed in (W. J. Liu et al., 2017)]. Among all SARSCoV proteins, T cell responses against the structural proteins have been found to be the most
immunogenic in peripheral blood mononuclear cells of convalescent SARS-CoV patients as compared
to the non-structural proteins (C. K.-F. Li et al., 2008). Further, of the structural proteins, T cell
responses against the S and N proteins have been reported to be the most dominant and long-lasting
(Channappanavar, Fett, Zhao, Meyerholz, & Perlman, 2014).

Here, by analysing available experimentally-determined SARS-CoV-derived B cell epitopes (both linear
and discontinuous) and T cell epitopes, we identify and report those that are completely identical and
comprise no mutation in the available SARS-CoV-2 sequences (as of 9 February 2020). These epitopes
have the potential, therefore, to elicit a cross-reactive/effective response against SARS-CoV-2. We
focused particularly on the epitopes in the S and N structural proteins due to their dominant and longlasting immune response previously reported against SARS-CoV. For the identified T cell epitopes, we
additionally incorporated the information about the associated MHC alleles to provide a list of epitopes
that seek to maximize population coverage globally, as well as in China. Our presented results can
potentially narrow down the search for potent targets for an effective vaccine against SARS-CoV-2, and
help guide experimental studies focused on vaccine development.

sequences were aligned separately for each protein using the MAFFT multiple sequence alignment

(ViPR)(https://www.viprbrc.org/; accessed 9 February 2020) (Pickett et al., 2012) by querying for the
virus species name: “Severe acute respiratory syndrome-related coronavirus” from human hosts. We
limited our search to include only the experimentally-determined epitopes that were associated with at
least one positive assay: (i) positive B cell assays (e.g., enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA)based qualitative binding) for B cell epitopes; and (ii) either positive T cell assays (such as enzymelinked immune absorbent spot (ELISPOT) or intracellular cytokine staining (ICS) IFN-γ release), or
positive major histocompatibility complex (MHC) binding assays for T cell epitopes. Strictly speaking,
the latter set of epitopes, determined using positive MHC binding assays, are candidate epitopes, since
a T cell response has not been confirmed experimentally. However, for brevity and to be consistent with
the terminology used in the ViPR database, we will not make this qualification, and will simply refer to
them as epitopes in this study. The number of B cell and T cell epitopes obtained from the database
following the above procedure is listed in Table 1.

Population-coverage-based T cell epitope selection. Population coverages for sets of T cell
epitopes were computed using the tool provided by the Immune Epitope Database (IEDB)
(http://tools.iedb.org/population/; accessed 9 February 2020) (Vita et al., 2019). This tool uses the
distribution of MHC alleles (with at least 4-digit resolution, e.g., A*02:01) within a defined population
(obtained from http://www.allelefrequencies.net/) to estimate the population coverage for a set of T cell
epitopes. The estimated population coverage represents the percentage of individuals within the
population that are likely to elicit an immune response to at least one T cell epitope from the set. To
identify the set of epitopes associated with MHC alleles that would maximize the population coverage,
we adopted a greedy approach: (i) we first identified the MHC allele with the highest individual
population coverage and initialized the set with their associated epitopes, then (ii) we progressively
added epitopes associated with other MHC alleles that resulted in the largest increase of the
accumulated population coverage. We stopped when no increase in the accumulated population
coverage was observed by adding epitopes associated with any of the remaining MHC alleles.

Constructing the phylogenetic tree. We used the publicly available software PASTA v1.6.4 [28] to
construct a maximum-likelihood phylogenetic tree of each structural protein using the unique set of
sequences in the available data of SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV, and SARS-CoV-2. We additionally included
the Zaria Bat coronavirus strain (accession ID: HQ166910.1) to serve as an outgroup. The appropriate
parameters for tree estimation are automatically selected in the software based on the provided
sequence data. For visualizing the constructed phylogenetic trees, we used the publicly available
software Dendroscope v3.6.3 [29]. Each constructed tree was rooted with the outgroup Zaria Bat
coronavirus strain, and circular phylogram layout was used.

Results
Structural proteins of SARS-CoV-2 are genetically similar to SARS-CoV, but not to MERS-CoV.
SARS-CoV-2 has been observed to be close to SARS-CoV—much more so than MERS-CoV—based
on full-length genome phylogenetic analysis (Lu et al., 2020; Zhou et al., 2020). We checked whether
this is also true at the level of the individual structural proteins (S, E, M, and N). A straightforward
reference-sequence-based comparison indeed confirmed this, showing that the M, N, and E proteins
of SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV have over 90% genetic similarity, while that of the S protein was
notably reduced (but still high) (Figure 1a). The similarity between SARS-CoV-2 and MERS-CoV, on
the other hand, was substantially lower for all proteins (Figure 1a); a feature that was also evident from
the corresponding phylogenetic trees (Figure 1b). We note that while the former analysis (Figure 1a)
was based on the reference sequence of each coronavirus, it is indeed a good representative of the
virus population, since few amino acid mutations have been observed in the corresponding sequence
data (Figure S1). It is also noteworthy that while MERS-CoV is the more recent coronavirus to have
infected humans, and is comparatively more recurrent (causing outbreaks in 2012, 2015, and 2018)
(https://www.who.int/emergencies/mers-cov/en/), SARS-CoV-2 is closer to SARS-CoV, which has not
been observed since 2004.

Given the close genetic similarity between the structural proteins of SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2, we
attempted to leverage immunological studies of the structural proteins of SARS-CoV to potentially aid
vaccine development for SARS-CoV-2. We focused specifically on the S and N proteins as these are
known to induce potent and long-lived immune responses in SARS-CoV (Channappanavar et al., 2014;
Deming et al., 2006; Graham et al., 2012; W. J. Liu et al., 2017; X Liu et al., 2004; J. Wang et al., 2003;
Yang et al., 2004). We used the available SARS-CoV-derived experimentally-determined epitope data
(see Materials and Methods) and searched to identify T cell and B cell epitopes that were identical—
and hence potentially cross-reactive—across SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2. We first report the analysis
for T cell epitopes, which have been shown to provide a long-lasting immune response against SARSCoV (Channappanavar et al., 2014), followed by a discussion of B cell epitopes.

Mapping the SARS-CoV-derived T cell epitopes that are identical in SARS-CoV-2, and
determining those with greatest estimated population coverage. The SARS-CoV-derived T cell
epitopes used in this study were experimentally-determined from two different types of assays (Pickett
et al., 2012): (i) positive T cell assays, which tested for a T cell response against epitopes, and (ii)
positive MHC binding assays, which tested for epitope-MHC binding. We aligned these T cell epitopes
across the SARS-CoV-2 protein sequences. Among the 115 T cell epitopes that were determined by
positive T cell assays (Table 1), we found that 27 epitope-sequences were identical within SARS-CoV2 proteins and comprised no mutation in the available SARS-CoV-2 sequences (as of 9 February 2020)
(Table 2). Interestingly, all of these were present in either the N (16) or S (11) protein. MHC binding
assays were performed for 19 of these 27 epitopes, and these were reported to be associated with only
five distinct MHC alleles (at 4-digit resolution): HLA-A*02:01, HLA-B*40:01, HLA-DRA*01:01, HLADRB1*07:01, and HLA-DRB1*04:01. Consequently, the accumulated population coverage of these
epitopes (see Materials and Methods for details) is estimated to not be high for the global population
(59.76%), and was quite low for China (32.36%). For the remaining 8 epitopes, since the associated
MHC alleles are unknown, they could not be used in the population coverage computation. Additional
MHC binding tests to identify the MHC alleles that bind to these 8 epitopes may reveal additional distinct
alleles, beyond the five determined so far, that may help to improve population coverage.

To further expand the search and identify potentially effective T cell targets covering a higher
percentage of the population, we next additionally considered the set of T cell epitopes that have been
experimentally-determined from positive MHC binding assays (Table 1), but, unlike the previous epitope
set, their ability to induce a T cell response against SARS-CoV was not experimentally determined.
Nonetheless, they also present promising candidates for inducing a response against SARS-CoV-2.
For the expanded set of epitopes, all of which have at least one positive MHC binding assay, we found
that 264 epitope-sequences have an identical match in SARS-CoV-2 proteins and have associated
MHC allele information available (listed in Table S2). Of these 264 epitopes, ~80% were MHC Class I
restricted epitopes (Table S3). Importantly, 102 of the 264 epitopes were derived from either the S (66)
or N (36) protein. Mapping all 66 S-derived epitopes onto the resolved crystal structure of the SARSCoV S protein (Figure 2) revealed that 3 of these (GYQPYRVVVL, QPYRVVVLSF, and PYRVVVLSF)
were located entirely in the SARS-CoV receptor-binding motif, known to be important for virus cell entry
(F. Li, 2005).

Similar to previous studies on HIV and HCV (Ahmed, Quadeer, Morales-Jimenez, & McKay, 2019;
Dahirel et al., 2011; Quadeer et al., 2014), we estimated population coverages for various combinations
of MHC alleles associated with these 102 epitopes. Our aim was to determine sets of epitopes
associated with MHC alleles with maximum population coverage, potentially aiding the development of
subunit vaccines against SARS-CoV-2. For selection, we adopted a greedy computational approach
(see Materials and Methods), which identified a set of T cell epitopes estimated to maximize global
population coverage. This set comprised of multiple T cell epitopes associated with 20 distinct MHC

alleles and was estimated to provide an accumulated population coverage of 96.29% (Table 3). We
also computed the population coverage of this specific set of epitopes in China, the country most
affected by the COVID-19 outbreak, which was estimated to be slightly lower (88.11%) as certain MHC
alleles (e.g., HLA-A*02:01) associated with some of these epitopes are less frequent in the Chinese
population (Table 3). Repeating the same greedy approach but focusing on the Chinese population,
instead of a global population, the maximum population coverage was estimated to be 92.76% (Table
S4).

Due to the promiscuous nature of binding between peptides and MHC alleles, multiple S and N peptides
were reported to bind to individual MHC alleles. Thus, while we list all the S and N epitopes that bind to
each MHC allele (Table 3), the estimated maximum population coverage may be achieved by selecting
at least one epitope for each listed MHC allele. Likewise, many individual S and N epitopes were found
to be presented by multiple alleles and thereby estimated to have varying global population coverage
(Table S5).
Mapping the SARS-CoV-derived B cell epitopes that are identical in SARS-CoV-2. Similar to T
cell epitopes, we used in our study the SARS-CoV-derived B cell epitopes that have been
experimentally-determined from positive B cell assays (Pickett et al., 2012). These epitopes were
classified as: (i) linear B cell epitopes (antigenic peptides), and (ii) discontinuous B cell epitopes
(conformational epitopes with resolved structural determinants).

We aligned the 298 linear B cell epitopes (Table 1) across the SARS-CoV-2 proteins and found that 50
epitope-sequences, all derived from structural proteins, have an identical match and comprised no
mutation in the available SARS-CoV-2 protein sequences (as of 9 February 2020). Interestingly, a large
number (45) of these were derived from either the S (23) or N (22) protein (Table 4), while the remaining
(5) were from the M and E proteins (Table S6).

On the other hand, all 6 SARS-CoV-derived discontinuous B cell epitopes obtained from the ViPR
database (Table 5) were derived from the S protein. Based on the pairwise alignment between the
SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 reference sequences (Figure S2), we found that none of these mapped
identically to the SARS-CoV-2 S protein, in contrast to the linear epitopes. For 3 of these discontinuous
B cell epitopes there was a partial mapping, with at least one site having an identical residue at the
corresponding site in the SARS-CoV-2 S protein (Table 5).

Mapping the residues of the B cell epitopes onto the available structure of the SARS-CoV S protein
revealed that the linear epitopes (Table 4) map to seemingly less-exposed regions, away from the most
exposed region, the “spike head” (Figure 3a). In contrast, all discontinuous B cell epitopes (Table 5)
map onto the spike head region (Figure 3b, top panel), which contains the receptor-binding motif of the
SARS-CoV S protein (F. Li, 2005). We observe that few residues of the discontinuous epitopes that lie

within the receptor-binding motif are identical within SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 (Figure 3b). It has
been reported recently that SARS-CoV-2 is able to bind to the same receptor as SARS-CoV (ACE2)
for cell entry, despite having multiple amino acid differences with SARS-CoV’s receptor-binding motif
(Hoffmann et al., 2020; Letko & Munster, 2020; Lu et al., 2020; Zhou et al., 2020). Whether the
antibodies specific to this motif maintain their binding and elicit an immune response against SARSCoV-2 warrants further experimental investigation.

Discussion
The quest for a vaccine against the novel SARS-CoV-2 is recognized as an urgent problem. Effective
vaccination could indeed play a significant role in curbing the spread of the virus, and help to eliminate
it from the human population. However, scientific efforts to address this challenge are only just
beginning. Much remains to be learnt about the virus, its biological properties, epidemiology, etc. At this
early stage, there is also a lack of information about specific immune responses against SARS-CoV-2,
which presents a challenge for vaccine development.

This study has sought to assist with the initial phase of vaccine development, by providing
recommendations of epitopes that may potentially be considered for incorporation in subunit vaccine
designs. Despite having limited understanding of how the human immune system responds naturally to
SARS-CoV-2, these epitopes are motivated by their responses that they have recorded in SARS-CoV
(or, for the case of T cell epitopes, to at least confer MHC binding), and the fact that they map identically
to SARS-CoV-2, based on the available sequence data (as of 9 February 2020). The identical map
between SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2, and the absence of any mutation in the identified epitopes
among the available SARS-CoV-2 sequences (as of 9 February 2020), suggests their potential for
eliciting a robust T cell or antibody response in SARS-CoV-2.

Research efforts directed towards the design and development of vaccines for SARS-CoV-2 are
increasing, and some related analyses are already being reported in distinct, parallel studies. Notably,
a preliminary analysis of linear B cell epitopes has been reported online on the ViPR database website
(https://www.viprbrc.org/brcDocs/documents/announcements/Corona/2019-nCoV-ViPRreport_24JAN2020.pdf). Different from our study, which is focused on the linear and discontinuous
SARS-CoV-derived epitopes, that analysis considered linear B cell epitope data for all
Betacoronaviruses from human hosts. While only a summary of the results has been provided so far,
preventing direct comparison of the individual epitopes, the number of linear B cell epitopes reported to
map identically to SARS-CoV-2 is comparable to our findings.

A recent study has also predicted T cell epitopes for SARS-CoV-2 that may be presented by a
population from the Asia-Pacific region (Ramaiah & Arumugaswami, 2020). Again, there are multiple
differences to our work. First, the focus of that study was on MHC Class II epitopes, while here we

considered both MHC Class I and II epitopes. Interestingly, while we found a few MHC Class II epitopes
using our approach (Table S3), only one of these (HLA-DRB1*01:01) appeared in our identified epitope
set (Table 3), due to their comparatively low estimated population coverage. Second, computational
tools were used to predict MHC Class II epitopes in (Ramaiah & Arumugaswami, 2020), while here we
analysed the SARS-CoV-derived epitopes that have been determined experimentally, using either
positive T cell or MHC binding assays, and which match identically with the available SARS-CoV-2
sequences (as of 9 February 2020).

We acknowledge that this is a preliminary analysis based on the limited sequence data available for
SARS-CoV-2 (as of 9 February 2020). As the virus continues to evolve and as more data is collected,
it is expected that additional mutations will be observed. Such mutations will not affect our analysis,
provided that they occur outside of the identified epitope regions. If mutations do occur within epitope
regions, then these epitopes may be further screened in line with the conservative filtering principle that
we have employed, thereby producing a more refined epitope set.

Further experimental studies (T cell and B cell assays) are required to determine the potential of the
identified epitopes to induce a positive immune response against SARS-CoV-2. This would help to
further refine the reported epitope set, based on observed immunogenicity; an important consideration
for immunogen design. Overall, as the identified set of epitopes map identically to SARS-CoV-2, they
present potentially useful candidates for guiding experimental efforts towards developing universal
vaccines against SARS-CoV-2.

Figure 1. Comparison of the similarity of structural proteins of SARS-CoV-2 with the corresponding
proteins of SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV. (a) Percentage genetic similarity of the individual structural proteins of
SARS-CoV-2 with those of SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV. The reference sequence of each coronavirus (Materials
and Methods) was used to calculate the percentage genetic similarity. (b) Circular phylogram of the phylogenetic
trees of the four structural proteins. All trees were constructed based on the available unique sequences using
PASTA (Mirarab et al., 2015) and rooted with the outgroup Zaria Bat CoV strain (accession ID: HQ166910.1).

Figure 2. Location of identified T cell epitopes on the SARS-CoV S protein structure (PDB ID: 5XLR).
Residues of the SARS-CoV-derived T cell epitopes (determined using positive MHC binding assays and that were
identical in SARS-CoV-2) are shown in green color. The 3 overlapping epitopes (GYQPYRVVVL, QPYRVVVLSF,
PYRVVVLSF) that lie within the SARS-CoV receptor-binding motif are shown as spheres.
