Fast Whole-Genome Phylogeny of the
COVID-19 Virus SARS-CoV-2 by
Compression
Rudi L. Cilibrasi
Paul M.B. Vitányi

Abstract
We analyze the whole genome phylogeny and taxonomy of the SARS-CoV-2 virus using
compression. This is a new fast alignment-free method called the “normalized compression distance”
(NCD) method. It discovers all effective similarities based on Kolmogorov complexity. The latter
being incomputable we approximate it by a good compressor such as the modern zpaq. The results
comprise that the SARS-CoV-2 virus is closest to the RaTG13 virus and similar to two bat SARS-like
coronaviruses bat-SL-CoVZXC21 and bat-SL-CoVZC4. The similarity is quantified and compared
with the same quantified similarities among the mtDNA of certain species. We treat the question
whether Pangolins are involved in the SARS-CoV-2 virus. The compression method is simpler and
possibly faster than any other whole genome method, which makes it the ideal tool to explore
phylogeny.

I.

INTRODUCTION

In the 2019 and 2020 pandemic of the COVID-19 illness many studies use essentially two
methods, alignment-based phylogenetic analyses e.g. [19], and an alignment-free machine
learning approach [23]. These pointed to the origin of the SARS-CoV-2 virus which causes
the COVID-19 pandemic as being from bats. It is thought to belong to lineage B (Sarbecovirus)
of Betacoronavirus. From phylogenetic analysis and genome organization it was identified as
a SARS-like coronavirus, and to have the highest similarity to the SARS bat coronavirus

RaTG13 [19] and similar to two bat SARS-like coronaviruses bat-SL-CoVZXC21 and batSL-CoVZC45.
Alignment methods are generally used but have many drawbacks which make alignmentfree methods more attractive [28], [27], [30]. The purpose of this study is to introduce a new
alignment-free method based on lossless compression of the whole genome sequences of base
pairs of the involved viruses, the normalized compression distance (NCD) method. We use
it here to identify the 60 closest viruses to the SARS-CoV-2 virus and to determine their
relations (taxonomy) in a phylogeny tree. With this method we can actually quantify these
relations and compare them to similar relations between the mtDNA’s of mammal species in
order to gain an intuition as to what they mean.
We computed the NCD’s of 6,751+15,409=22,160 virus pairs plus the NCD’s used for
Figures 1 and 2. Altogether, this took about 5–10 hours in a combined run on a home
desktop computer (a mini-computer called Meerkat from a Linux computer company called
System76). It uses less than 2 seconds per pair which comes to more than 2000 pairs per hour.
The same program can be reused for different phylogenies and questions. This is possibly
the easiest and fastest method to establish whole genome phylogeny.

AND

M ETHOD

We first obtain viruses (in this case at least 6,500 of them) we want to compare the SARSCoV-2 virus to, without duplicates, partially sequenced viruses, and SARS-CoV-2 viruses.
RNA sequences have A,C,G,U and DNA have A,C,G,T base pairs, but since SARS-CoV-2
is an RNA virus but all sequences considered here have base pairs A,C,G,T, technically the
sequences are cDNA (complementary DNA) of the RNA sequence in the virus itself. We
select a SARS-CoV-2 virus from the many, at least 15,500, examples available. Compute for
each virus we want to compare with the selected SARS-CoV-2 virus its NCD distance with the
selected SARS-CoV-2 virus. For an explanation of the NCD see the Appendix. Subsequently
we order the resulting NCD’s from the smallest to the largest. The virus causing the smallest
NCD distance with the SARS-CoV-2 virus is the most similar to that virus. We next take the
60 viruses which have the least NCD’s with the selected SARS-CoV-2 virus and compute
the phylogeny of those viruses and the SARS-CoV-2 virus. Next we compare 37 viruses to
determine the relation of the SARS-CoV-2 virus with Pangolins.

III. DATA

AND

DATA C LEANING

We downloaded the data broadly in two parts. The original input data are stored by Rudi
Cilibrasi at:
-rw-rw-r– 1 rudi rudi 2.0G Jul 17 15:46 incoming/gisaid hcov-19 2020 07 17 22.fasta
-rw-rw-r– 1 rudi rudi 29M Jul 17 15:45 incoming/gurjit-data.zip
We downloaded from the GISAID [11] database on July 17th, 2020 in total 66,899
sequences. A part of at least 99.9% of the GISAID data are SARS-CoV-2 viruses. The
remainder are not technically SARS-CoV-2 viruses but are related and of interest. One of
the authors of the machine learning approach study [23] was so kind as to supply us with
the 6,751 sequences used in that paper. There is one SARS-CoV-2 virus among them. Thus,
at least 99.9% of the data is not SARS-CoV-2 viruses but other viruses. Therefore we can
compare our results about the phylogeny of SARS-CoV-2 directly with those of [23].
We removed a single sequence with a special exception part in the code because it had
a bad name: gisaid hcov-19 2020 07 17 22.fasta.fai hCoV-19 29868 1713295574 80 82.
That name is too short to be useful: “hCoV-19.” Altogether therefore we imported 73,649
sequences total into the raw sequence database. Each viral sequence is an RNA sequence and
seems to be around 30,000 RNA base pairs (A,T,G,C) in size. The total size of all sequence
data together is in the order of two Gigabyte. Of the sequences initially downloaded from
GISAID, we applied a lowercase transformation to each to reduce pointless variability. After
that, we computed a histogram of all the characters in the sequence and counted the size of
each group. Many sequences contained the base pairs A, C, G, N, T or other letters. The
letters A,C,G, and T signify the basic DNA nucleotides. the meaning of ’N’ and the other
letters involved can be found on a FASTA file format reference webpage. For example, “N”
means “unknown nucleotide residue.” We retained the deduplicated unique 15,578 sequences
with the known nucleotides A,C,G, and T from the GISAID download. The 6,751 sequences
obtained from the authors of [23] were over the letters A,C,G, and T already.
As a representative of the SARS-CoV-2 virus we selected the most common one in the
dataset as the basis for the NCD against all others. It appeared in the sorted virus list
with 105 multiples. In Section IV it appears at the top with an NCD of 0.003621 and
has the official name of gisaid hcov-19 2020 07 17 22.fasta<hCoV-19/USA/WI-WSLH200082/2020—EPI ISL 471246—2020-04-08 .
We then looked at whether there was much variation among the SARS-CoV-2 viruses

themselves since this may invalidate the NCD distance between the inspected viruses and
the selected SARS-CoV-2 virus. We retained the viruses in the list after deduplication and
filtering for A,C,G,T. The worst NCD against the selected SARS-CoV-2 virus was 0.874027
namely gisaid hcov-19 2020 07 17 22.fasta <hCoV-19/pangolin/Guangxi/P1E/2017EPI ISL
4105392017 from a Pangolin. Removing that one sequence from the list we got a worst NCD
of 0.873367 also from a Pangolin in 2017.
(To clarify why there is the discrepancy below in that we obtain 15,578 imported sequences
but when counting lose 100–200 in the next phase: There are some exact name duplicates in
the GISAID data. When the “imported sequence” count is reported, then we count identically
named identical sequences separately because they did both get imported (but one would
overwrite the other). When counting the different names for sequences without /2017, /2018,
/2019 in the name, these exact-name duplicates would collapse into a single one causing just
one count.)
Initially there are 15,430 sequences from GISAID that contain “hCov” in the name. We
then removed all sequences that contained /2017 in the name. After this we were left with
15,428 sequences and obtained a worst NCD of 0.738175 also from a Pangolin.
Removing all sequences that contained /2017, /2018, or /2019 in the name, left
15,409 viruses in the list. The worst-case NCD across all the remaining sequences of
the SARS-CoV-2 virus to the selected SARS-CoV-2 virus is 0.044986 and the average is 0.009879. This shows that the 15,428 SARS-CoV-2 viruses retrieved from GISAID on July 17 in 2020 all have sequences that hardly differ from one another. The
worst-case sequence [20] can be found at gisaid hcov-19 2020 07 17 22.fasta<hCoV19/USA/OH-OSUP0019/2020—EPI ISL 427291—2020-03-31 and its registration code is
EPI ISL 427291 [20].
With respect to the figures: Figures 1 and 2 were done with the PHYLIP (PHYLogeny
Inference Package) [29] and Figure 3 with the Complearn Package [5]. The programming is
easy. Essentially one only has to compute Equation A.4 for all pairs of viruses to be compared.
The comparisons between the NCD’s of viruses and the NCD’s of the mtDNA’s of species
are made on basis of Table II. Since the NCD is a metric (satisfies the triangle property) [6,
Theorem 6.2] the above variation of NCD’s of different SARS-CoV-2 viruses will not unduly
upset the greater NCD distances (only by ±0.044986) between the other viruses (the 6,751
non-SARS-CoV-2 viruses) and the selected SARS-CoV-2 virus. The analytic software which

since the number is so very low. The code is MN908947.3. It is isolate Wuhan-Hu-1, complete
genome GenBank: MN908947.3 of 29903 bp ss-RNA linear VRL 18-MAR-2020 of the family
Viruses; Riboviria; Orthornavirae; Pisuviricota; Pisoniviricetes; Nidovirales; Cornidovirineae;
Coronaviridae; Orthocoronavirinae; Betacoronavirus; Sarbecovirus.
The following virus has an NCD of 0.444846 with the selected SARS-CoV-2 virus and is the
closest (apart from the above SARS-CoV-2 virus). It is Sarbecovirus/EPI ISL 402131.fasta/
<BetaCoV/bat/Yunnan/RaTG13/2013—EPI ISL 402131. The first part is the classification
of the subfamily of viruses, the code EPI ISL 402131 is that of the virus itself which one
can use with Google to obtain further information.
In this case the virus is sampled from a bat in Yunnan Province in in the PRC (China)
in 2013 and is 29855 bp RNA linear VRL 24-MAR-2020, and its final registration code
is MN996532. It is known as Bat coronavirus RaTG13 of the family Viruses; Riboviria;
Orthornavirae; Pisuviricota; Pisoniviricetes; Nidovirales; Cornidovirineae; Coronaviridae;
Orthocoronavirinae; Betacoronavirus; Sarbecovirus. The virus is found in the Rhinolophus
affinis, a medium-size Asian bat of the Yunnan Province (China). The human coronavirus
genome shares at least 96.2% of its identity with its bat relative, while its similarity rate with
the human strain of the SARS virus (Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome) is much lower,
only 80.3% [8]. The NCD distance between the selected RSA-CoV-2 virus and this virus is
about the same as that between the mtDNA’s of the Chimpansee and the PigmyChimpansee
according to the Table II.
The next three viruses have respectively NCD=0.788416 for Coronaviridae/CoVZC45.fasta/
< MG772933.1, and NCD=0.791082 for Coronaviridae/CoVZXC21.fasta/ < MG772934.1
and at a larger distance NCD=0.917493 for Coronaviridae/Coronaviridae 783.fasta/ <
KC881006 Here the part “fasta/ < KC881006” means that the registration code is KC881086.
The first of these two viruses is the Bat SARS-like coronavirus isolate bat-SL-CoVZC45,
complete genome at 29802 bp RNA linear VRL 05-FEB-2020 of the above family of viruses.
Its NCD with the selected SARS-CoV-2 virus is slightly larger than the mtDNA distance
between the Human and the Gorilla at 0.737 and slightly lower than the mtDNA distance
between the Human and the Orangutan at 0.834.
The second of these two viruses is the Bat SARS-like coronavirus isolate bat-SLCoVZXC21, complete genome at 29732 bp RNA linear VRL 05-FEB-2020 of the same
family. The same comparison of the NCD distance between this virus and the selected SARS-

Fig. 1. The evolutionary directed binary tree built from the 60 virus sequences in Table I. These viruses have the least NCD
distance with the SARS-CoV-2 virus. S(T ) = 0.998948. We use human mtDNA as outgroup; it is about the same size as
the viruses and it can be assumed to be completely different. Where it joins the tree there is the root. The labeling of the
items is as follows. All sequences are labeled as they occur in the data of [23] together with their registration code. The most
interesting are the 11th to 15th (inclusive) sequences of the tree from the top of the page. The 13th to 15th virus sequences
(inclusive) are the most interesting for us. The 13th is EPI ISL 402131 which is the bat/Yunnan/RaTG13/2013 that is the
RaTG13 Bat Coronavirus sampled in Yunnan in 2013. The 14th label is selected SARS-CoV-2 virus which occurs 105 times
in the virus database of GISAID. It is the top one in the sorted list Table I with NCD of about 0 with respect to the selected
SARS-CoV-2 virus, that is, it is the same virus EPI ISL 428253. The 15th label is MN908947 which is a a SARS-CoV-2
virus Wuhan Hu-1 from the Wuhan Seafood market collected Dec 2019, submitted 05-JAN-2020, and reported in Nature,
579(7798), 265–269, 270–273 (2020). This is the only SARS-CoV-2 virus in the 6,751 sequences obtained from the authors
of [23]. The 11th and 12th labels are the CoVZC45 Bat Coronavirus and the CoVZXC21 Bat Coronavirus. Numbers 11, 12,
13, 14, and 15 have the least NCD distances to the selected SARS-CoV-2 virus. Here are the NCD’s of the selected SARSCoV-2 virus against 59 others: selected SARS CoV 2 EPI ISL 471246 0.932533 0.994986 0.918724 0.919072 0.925802

A. The Pangolin connection
As we saw in determining the worst-case NCD between the selected SARS-CoV-2 virus
and other GISAID SARS-CoV-2 database viruses the database is littered with Pangolin viruses
from 2017, 2018, and 2019. Several studies e.g. [16], [31] hold that while the SARS-CoV-2
virus probably originates from bats it may have been transmitted to another animal and/or

recombined with a virus there and transmitted zoonotic to humans. The other animal is most
often identified as the Pangolin. The compression method shows that the NCD’s between the
Pangolin SARS-CoV-2 virus and the human SARS-CoV-2 virus are far apart. However, they
are not farther apart than 0.738175 to 0.874027. This is between the NCD distance of the
mtDNA of a Human to a Gorilla up to the mtDNA of a Greyseal to a Bluewhale. The bat-SLCoVZXC21 and bat-SL-CoVZC45 viruses are at NCD=0.791082 and NCD=0.788416. That
is in between the mtDNA NCD distance of a Human versus a Gorilla at 0.737 and the mtDNA
distance of a Human versus an Orangutan at 0.834. Thus the Pangolin and bat origins are
possible for the SARS-CoV-2 virus while the bat origin is more likely and modification by
the Pangolin is a possibility from these data. But the RaTG13 virus has an NCD=0.444846
distance with the human SARS-CoV-2 virus that is close to one half of the Pangolin distance.
As noted before, this is comparable with the NCD distance between the Chimpansee and the
PigmyChimpansee according to the Table II. Also in the tree of Figure 2 the Pangolin viruses
are generally far from the selected SARS-CoV-2 virus. Hence the hypothesis that the Pangolin
species is an intermediary between the bat viruses above and the human SARS-CoV-2 virus
is perhaps unlikely.
V. D ISCUSSION
Previously most studies into the COVID-19 pandemic suggested that the virus involved
originated from bats. Bats are a known reservoir of viruses that can zoonotic transmit to
humans [18]. Virtually all those mentioned studies use alignment-based methods. Analyzing
the involved SARS-CoV-2 virus with the NCD is in this setting a novel alignment-free method
based on compression. It places the RaTG13 bat virus the closest to the SARS-CoV-2 virus
followed by the two SARS-like coronaviruses bat-SL-CoVZXC21 and bat-SL-CoVZC4. The
similarity is quantified and compared with the same quantified similarities among the mtDNA
of certain species. A possible involved other animal is the Pangolin. The method used here, the
normalized compression distance (NCD) method is based on Kolmogorov complexity analysis
and compression [15], [6]. It is domain-independent and requires no parameters to be set,
apart from the used compression algorithm. Earlier studies using alignment-based methods
have suggested that the the SARS-CoV-2 virus originated from bats before being zoonotical
transferred to humans. The machine-learning approach, an alignment-free method, in [23]
came to the same conclusion. The current, completely different, alignment-free method with

the results we present here, confirms this conclusion. Hence there is little doubt by now that
the virus involved originates from bats with as runner-up the Pangolin.
VI. C ONCLUSION
We provide a new alignment-free method based on compression to determine the phylogeny
and taxonomy of the SARS-CoV-2 virus (the virus causing the COVID-19 pandemic). The
method is based on compression, remarkably simple, very fast, and quantifies a distance to
a number between 0 (identical) and 1 (totally different). It uses only the unprocessed viral
DNA/RNA sequences. In the Appendix it is briefly explained and illustrated by examples
of mammal species via mtDNA sequences and the phylogeny and taxonomy of the SARS
virus. To compare it with another alignment-free method based on machine learning and
other techniques [23] we used the same database of over 6000 unique viral sequences. To
select the sequence of the SARS-CoV-2 virus against which the unique viral sequences are
compared we use a database of over 15,000 unique SARS-CoV-2 viruses. Obtaining similar
results as the earlier studies, and confirming the generally believed hypothesis, this method
is less complicated than the previous methods. It yields quantitative evidence that can be
compared with similar distances among the mtDNA of familiar mammals. Since the method
is uncomplicated and very fast it is useful as an exploratory investigation into the phylogeny
and taxonomy of viruses of new epidemic outbreaks.
A PPENDIX
In 1936 A.M. Turing [25] defined the hypothetical “Turing machine” whose computations
are intended to give a formal definition of the intuitive notion of computability in the discrete
domain. These Turing machines compute integer functions, the computable functions. By
using pairs of integers for the arguments and values we can extend computable functions to
functions with rational arguments and/or values.
A. Kolmogorov Complexity
Informally, the Kolmogorov complexity of a string is the length of a shortest string from
which the original string can be losslessly reconstructed by an effective general-purpose
computer such as a particular universal Turing machine U. Hence it constitutes a lower
bound on how far a lossless compression program can compress. For details see the text
[17]. In this paper we require that the set of programs of U is prefix free (no program is a

proper prefix of another program), that is, we deal with the prefix Kolmogorov complexity. We
call U the reference universal prefix machine. Formally, the conditional prefix Kolmogorov
complexity K(x|y) is the length of a shortest input z such that the reference universal prefix
machine U on input z with auxiliary information y outputs x. The unconditional prefix
Kolmogorov complexity K(x) is defined by K(x|ǫ) where ǫ is the empty word of length
0.. The functions K(·) and K(·|·), though defined in terms of a particular machine model,
are machine-independent up to an additive constant and acquire an asymptotically universal
and absolute character through Church’s thesis, and from the ability of universal machines to
simulate one another and execute any effective process.
The Kolmogorov complexity of an individual finite object was introduced by Kolmogorov
[12] as an absolute and objective quantification of the amount of information in it. It is
sometimes confused with the information theory of Shannon [21], which deals with average
information to communicate objects produced by a random source. They are quite different.
B. Information Distance
The information distance D(x, y) between strings x and y is defined as
D(x, y) = min{|p| : U(p, x) = y ∧ U(p, y) = x},
p

where U is the reference universal prefix machine above. Like the Kolmogorov complexity
K, the distance function D is upper semicomputable. Define
E(x, y) = max{K(x|y), K(y|x)}.
In [1] it is shown that the function E is upper semicomputable, (Here and elsewhere in this
paper “logarithm” or “log” refers to the binary logarithm.) D(x, y) = E(x, y)+O(log E(x, y)),
the function E is a metric (more precisely, that it satisfies the metric (in)equalities up to
a constant), and that E is minimal (up to a constant) among all upper semicomputable
P
−D ′ (x,y)
distance functions D ′ satisfying the normalization conditions

−D (x,y)
≤ 1 (to exclude bogus distances which state, for example, that every y

of a given x). We call this metric E universal.

Thus, for every pair of finite files x, y we have that E(x, y) is at least as small as the
smallest D ′ (x, y). This means that E(x, y) is at least as small as the distance engendered by

the dominant feature shared between x and y. The normalized information distance (NID) is
defined by
NID(x, y) =

E(x, y)
.
max{K(x), K(y)}

(A.1)

It is straightforward that 0 ≤ NID(x, y) ≤ 1 (up to an O(1/ max{K(x), K(y)}) additive
term). It is is a metric [15] (and so is the NCD we will meet in (A.4) see [6]. As an
aside, a nonoptimal precursor to the NID/NCD was given in [14].) Since by the symmetry
of information law [10] or see [17],
K(x, y) = K(x) + K(y|x) + O(log(K(x) + K(y)))

(A.2)

= K(y) + K(x|y) + O(log(K(x) + K(y))),
rewriting the NID using (A.2) yields
NID(x, y) =

K(x, y) − min{K(x), K(y)}
,
max{K(x), K(y)}

(A.3)

up to some small aditive terms that we ignore. For more details on this derivation see [17]
or [26].
In this way, in [1], [15] we and others developed theoretical approaches to the similarity
of finite objects. We proved that these theories based on Kolmogorov complexity are perfect.
By approximating the Kolmogorov complexities involved by real-world compressors we
transformed these theoretical notions into applications that work better than we could expect
[6], [7]. It turns out that on natural data the above process gives adequate results. The
resulting similarity measure is a parameter-free and alignment-free method. (In bioinformatics
the computation of the similarity between genetic strings commonly involves the so-called
“alignment method.” This method incurs often a high or even forbidding computational cost.
for certain problems biologists look for alignment-free methods.) It is a non feature-based
similarity. That is, it captures every effective distance: effective versions of Hamming distance,
Euclidean distance, edit distances, alignment distance, Lempel-Ziv distance, and so on. It can
simultaneously detect all similarities between pieces that other effective distances can detect
separately.
Let us give an intuitive explanation. Two objects are deemed close if we can significantly
“compress” one given the information in the other, the intuition being that if two pieces are
more similar, then we can more succinctly describe one given the other. The NID discovers

all effective similarities in the sense that if two objects are close according to some effective
similarity then they are also close according to the NID. One of the advantages of this
similarity is that it works for noisy objects [4]. It is a quantity between 0 (identical) and 1
(completely dissimilar).
C. Normalized Compression Distance
Unfortunately, the universality of the NID comes at the price of incomputability. In fact,
it is not even semicomputable and there is no semicomputable function at a computable
distance of it [24]. One uses real data-compression programs to approximate the Kolmogorov
complexity. The length of the compressed version of a finite object is obviously computable.
Usually the computation process is fast. For the natural data we are dealing with we assume
that the length of the compressed version is not too far from its Kolmogorov complexity. We
substitute the Kolmogorov complexity in the NID by its approximation. If Z is a compressor
and we use Z(x) to denote the length of the compressed version of a string x, then we arrive
at the Normalized Compression Distance:
NCDZ (x, y) =

Z(xy) − min(Z(x), Z(y))
,
max(Z(x), Z(y))

(A.4)

where we have replaced the pair (x, y) in the formula by the concatenation xy (file y appended
to file x) and we ignore logarithmic terms in the numerator and denominator, see [6].
R EMARK 1. In [6] there are axioms to capture the real-world setting, and show that
(A.4) approximates optimality. Actually, the NCD is a family of compression functions
parameterized by the given data compressor Z. Common compressors are gzip (a Lempel-Ziv
compressor with small window size of 32kB), bzip2 (a block-sorting compressor based on
the Burrows-Wheeler transform with a larger window size of 256kB), and PPMZ (prediction
by partial matching (PPM) which is an adaptive statistical data compression technique based
on context modeling and prediction [9].
The objects being compared for similarity must fit in, say, one-half the window size. Gzip
is by far the poorest compressor while PPMZ the best (although slowest) in this lineup.
For example, the ideal compressor Z takes care that NCDZ (x, x) equals 0. With Z =gzip
usually it is between

1
2

and 1 (very bad). With Z =bzip2 it is lower but nowhere near 0,

and NCDP P M Z (x, x) in the genomic experiment of Table II below was between 0.002 and
0.006. For more experimental evidence see [3].

R EMARK 2. Because of the normalization it does not matter for the NCD whether the length
of data set x is different from the length of y. In practice, this difference should not be too
great.

To visualise the n2 pairwise distances between n data we construct a dendrogram. To do
so we take the n × n distance matrix as input, and construct a dendrogram with the n objects
as leaves (so the dendrogram contains n external nodes or leaves and n − 2 internal nodes
like in the figures below). We assume n ≥ 4. The resulting dendrogram models the distance
matrix as good as possible qualitatively. If the distance between object o1 and object o2 is
smaller that between o1 and o3 , then the shortest path in the dendrogram between o1 and o2
has at most as many edges as the shortest path between o1 and o3 (equal if o2 and o3 are
sibling nodes.) Thus, the edges themselves have no length and the dendrogram represents
the partial order induced by the distance matrix. The S(T ) value in Figures 1 and 3 (with
S(T ) = 1 is as good as possible) tells how well the tree represents the distance matrix [6].
For details see the cited reference. The method is available as an open-source software tool
[5].
D. Phylogeny
A DNA sequence is a finite string over a 4-letter alphabet {A, C, G, T }. We used the
mitochondrial genomes (mtDNA) of 21 mammals, each of at most 18,000 base pairs, obtained
from the GenBank Database. Hence, the mtDNA of every species involved is a string of at
most 36,000 bits. Since we use the entire mtDNA of every species involved we do ”wholegenome” phylogeny.
Whole genome phylogeny is usually only feasible with alignment-free methods, like the
NCD method. This type of phylogeny is often computationally forbidding for the usual
alignment methods used in bioinformatics. Moreover, gene areas move easily over the genome
to other places again making the use of these methods impossible or hard. Hence it is more
usual in bioinformatics to select a particular gene from the genome of each species. This
particular gene should not evolve too fast, like the gene coding for insulin. Mutations here
are usually fatal for the individual concerned. Thus, biologists feel that comparing these genes
of species gives trustworthy information about the evolution of species. This may be called
“gene tree phylogeny.” See [22]. However, using different genes may result in different trees

[2]. But using the whole genome gives a single tree. For the 21 original species used we do
not give the Latin names; they can be found in [6].
For every pair of mitochondrial genome sequences x and y, we evaluated the formula in
Equation A.4 using a good compressor like PPMZ The resulting distances are the entries in
an 21 × 21 distance matrix Table II. Constructing a phylogeny tree from the distance matrix,
for example using our quartet tree method [7] or PHILIP [29] as tree-reconstruction software,
gives the corresponding tree.
E. SARS Virus
We clustered the SARS virus directly after its sequenced genome was made publicly
available, in relation to potential similar viruses. The 15 virus genomes were downloaded
from The Universal Virus Database of the International Committee on Taxonomy of Viruses,
available on Internet. The SARS virus was downloaded from Canada’s Michael Smith Genome
Sciences Centre which had the first public SARS Coronovirus draft whole genome assembly
available for download (SARS TOR2 draft genome assembly 120403). The NCD distance
matrix was computed using the compressor bzip2. The entire computation took only a couple
of minutes. The relations in Figure 3 are very similar to the definitive tree based on medicalmacrobio-genomics analysis, appearing later in the New England Journal of Medicine [13].

We depicted the figure in the ternary tree style, rather than the genomics-dendrogram style,
since the former is more precise for visual inspection of proximity relations.
