Abstract

14

Niemann-Pick type C1 (NPC1) receptor is an endosomal membrane protein that

15

regulates intracellular cholesterol trafficking, which is crucial in the Ebola virus

16

(EBOV) cycle. The severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-

17

CoV-2) enters the cell by binding of the viral spike (S) protein to

18

the ACE2 receptor.

19

surface transmembrane serine protease TMPRSS2 for plasma membrane fusion

20

or cathepsin L for endosomal entry. Additional host factors are required for viral

21

fusion at endosomes. Here, we report a novel interaction of the SARS-CoV-2

22

nucleoprotein (N) with the cholesterol transporter NPC1. Moreover, small

23

molecules interfering with NPC1 that inhibit EBOV entry, also inhibited human

24

coronavirus. Our findings suggest an important role for NPC1 in SARS-CoV-2

25

infection, a common strategy shared with EBOV, and a potential therapeutic

target to fight against COVID-19.

Introduction

31
32

To date, the COVID-19 pandemic has caused over one million of deaths and

33

affected over 73-millions of people around the world (1). COVID-19 is caused by

34

the emerging and pathogenic severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2

35

(SARS-CoV-2) first reported in the city of Wuhan (China) as a rare pneumonia

36

(2, 3) that rapidly spread worldwide. A better understanding of the biology of

37

SARS-CoV-2 is vital in order to develop effective therapeutics.

38

A key step of the biology of SARS-CoV-2 is the cell entry mechanism. Viral entry

39

involves the activation of its trimeric spike glycoprotein by TMPRSS2 protease

40

upon interaction with the angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) receptor at

41

the plasma membrane to mediate fusion (4-8). Also, the virus can enter via

42

endosomes under cathepsin L processing, similar to SARS-CoV-1 (7, 9). In fact,

43

the inhibition of both alternative entries is necessary for full inhibition of SARS-

44

CoV-2 entry (10, 11). Other cellular proteases facilitate SARS-CoV-2 cell tropism,

45

like furin, possibly at a post-binding step (12, 13).

46

Considering that SARS-CoV-2 may enter the cell by endocytosis, it would be

47

partially acid pH dependent and should exit endosomes by fusion to start

48

replication (13). SARS-CoV-2 replication occurs in the cytoplasm at double

49

membrane vesicles of possible origin in the endoplasmic reticulum, which provide

50

support to the viral RNA replication and transcription complex (14-16).

51

SARS-CoV-2 endosomal pH-dependent masking through endosomal cleavage

52

was recently described (8). Similarly, endosomal processing of the Ebola virus

53

(EBOV) glycoprotein trimer enhances infectivity and evidence a conformational

54

masking of the receptor binding site of this protein (17, 18). A similar process has

55

been described for the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) envelope trimer (19).

56

Therefore, the similarities found between these viruses were the start point of this

57

work. EBOV enters the cell using the endocytic pathway, and its entry is mediated

58

by the viral glycoprotein (GP), which decorates the viral surface organized in

59

trimeric spikes (20). The GP is then processed by endosomal cathepsins to

60

remove its heavily glycosylated C-terminal residues and the glycan cap. This

61

removal produces the cleaved form of the N-terminal receptor binding subunit

62

GP1 (GPCL) that is required to mediate fusion at the endosomal membrane. Two

63

simultaneous publications described first that the endosomal receptor called

64

NPC1 is an intracellular host receptor for EBOV (21, 22). Since then, the

65

relevance of NPC1 on viral infections have been shown for different viruses

66

including HIV (23), Hepatitis C (HCV) (24, 25), Chikungunya virus (CHIKV) (26)

67

and several Flaviviruses such as Dengue (DENV) (27, 28) and ZIKA virus (29)

68

among others (26, 30).

69
70

Given SARS-CoV-2 can be internalized via clathrin- and non-clathrin-mediated

71

endocytosis; some researchers hypothesized a role for NPC1 in SARS-CoV-2

72

infection that remains to be determined (31-34). Due to the increasing relevance

73

of this molecule, we designed our study to investigate the potential binding of

74

SARS-CoV-2 proteins to NPC1, according to the existing evidence of SARS-

75

CoV-2 endosomal passage (35).

Cell culture and viruses

80

Human embryonic kidney cells 293T/17 (HEK 293T; ATCC-CRL-11268) were

81

cultured in Dulbecco modified Eagle medium (DMEM) at 37 ºC and 5% CO 2

82

atmosphere, supplemented with 100 IU/ml penicillin, 100 µg/ml streptomycin, 1X

83

GlutaMAX (Thermo Fisher) and 10% heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum (FBS).

84

Huh-7 Lunet C3 cells, a gift from T. Pietschman (Twincore, Germany), were

85

cultured at 37 ºC in Dulbecco’s modified Eagle’s medium (DMEM) supplemented

86

with 100 IU/ml penicillin, 100 µg/ml streptomycin, 10mM HEPES, 1X NEAA and

87

10% of heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum (FBS).

88

For virus infections, we used common cold coronavirus 229E, which expresses

89

the green fluorescent protein (GFP) gene (229E-GFP) (36). This recombinant

90

virus was kindly given by V. Thiel, at the University of Bern, in Switzerland. The

91

infection experiments were conducted at 33°C and 5% CO2.

EGFP.

95

The methodology used in this part of the study was previously used in Garcia-

96

Dorival et al., 2016 (37). To generate the SARS-CoV-2 N with N-terminal EGFP

97

tag (EGFP-N), a codon optimized cDNA sequence for the ORF of SARS-CoV-2

98

N (NCBI reference sequence number: NC_045512) was cloned into the pEGFP-

99

C1 (by GeneArt-Thermo Fisher Scientific). Once cloned, the sequence of the

100

plasmid EGFP-N was confirmed by sequencing (Gene Art–Thermo Fisher

101

Scientific).

111

Immunoprecipitations (IP)

112

EGFP-N and EGFP immunoprecipitations (IP) were done using a GFP-Trap_A

113

(Chromotek). To do the IPs, the cell pellet was resuspended in 200μl of lysis

114

buffer (10mM Tris/Cl pH 7.5; 150mM NaCl; 0.5mM EDTA; 0.5%NP40) and then

115

incubated for 30 minutes on ice. The lysate was then clarified by centrifugation at

116

14000 x g and diluted five-fold with dilution buffer (10mM Tris/Cl pH 7.5; 150mM

117

NaCl; 0.5mM EDTA). The GFP-Trap agarose beads were equilibrated with ice-

118

cold dilution buffer and then incubated with diluted cell lysate overnight at 4°C on

119

a rotator, followed by centrifugation at 2700 x g for 2 minutes. The bead pellet

120

was wash two times with wash buffer (10mM Tris/Cl pH 7.5; 150mM NaCl; 0.5mM

121

EDTA). After removal of wash buffer, the beads were resuspended in 100μl of

122

Sample Buffer, Laemmli 2X Concentrate (Sigma Aldrich) and boiled at 95 for ten

123

minutes to elute the bound proteins. Buffers used for Immunoprecipitations were

124

all supplemented with HaltTM Protease Inhibitor Cocktail EDTA-Free (Thermo

125

Fisher Scientific).

126
127

Co-Immunoprecipitation (Co-IP)

128

Similar to what was described in Garcia-Dorival et al, 2016 (37), Co-IP for NPC1

129

was performed using 50μl of the Immobilized Recombinant Protein G Resin

130

(Generon) and specific antibodies against NPC1 (Abcam, ab108921). The cell

131

pellets were incubated for 30 minutes on ice with 200μl lysis buffer. The lysate

132

was then clarified by centrifugation and diluted five-fold with dilution buffer prior

133

to adding 2g of the primary antibody and then incubated at 4°C on a rotator for

134

two hours. The protein G resin (Generon) were equilibrated with ice-cold dilution

135

buffer and then incubated at 4°C on a rotator with diluted cell lysate containing

136

the antibody overnight at 4°C on a rotator, followed by centrifugation at 2500 x g

137

for 2 minutes to remove non-bounds fractions. The wash and elution steps were

138

performed as describe previously in GFP co-immunoprecipitation.

139
140

Western blot analysis

141

To do confirm the expression of GFP and GFP-N proteins, an SDS-PAGE and a

142

western blot (WB) was done. For the SDS-PAGE, a Mini-PROTEAN TGX Gels

143

were used (Bio-Rad 4561096), then, the gels were transferred to PVDF

144

membranes using the Trans-Blot Turbo Transfect Pack (Bio-Rad 1704159) and

145

the Trans-Blot Turbo system (Bio-Rad). Following this, the transferred

146

membranes were then blocked in 10% skimmed milk powder dissolved in TBS-

147

0.1% Tween (TBS-T) (50mM Tris-HCl (pH8.3), 150mM NaCl and 0.5% (v/v)

148

Tween-20) buffer for one hour at room temperature. Primary antibody was diluted

149

1:1000 in blocking buffer and then incubated at 4C overnight. After three

150

washes, blots were incubated with appropriate HRP secondary antibody diluted

151

in blocking buffer at a 1:5000 for 1 hour at room temperature. Blots then were

152

developed using enhanced chemiluminescence reagent (Bio-Rad) and detected

153

with ChemiDoc™ XRS Gel Imaging System using Image Lab™ software (Bio-

154

Rad).

155
156

Production of SARS-CoV-2 N protein in the baculovirus system

157

The sequence of the N protein published in the NCBI database was selected

158

(GenBank accession number: 43740575 / NCBI reference sequence number:

159

NC_045512). The codon usage of the N encoding gene was optimized for its

160

expression in insect cells (OptimumGene™-Codon Optimization algorithm) and

161

the coding sequence for this protein was synthesized by the company GenScript.

162

The donor plasmid pFastBac1 containing an expression cassette expressing the

163

recombinant protein under the control of the polyhedrin promoter was obtained.

164

The Bacmid for the generation of the baculovirus was prepared in E. Coli

165

DH10Bac bacterial cells containing the mini-Tn-7-replicon. Bacmids were

166

transfected in the regulatory Sf9 cells and a viral clone selection was made by

167

two rounds of plaque cloning to obtain the working virus stock. The baculovirus

168

genome region was sequenced to determine the integrity of the N gene in the

169

recombinant baculovirus named rBacN.

171

SARS-CoV-2 N protein production in pupae

172

The production of SARS-CoV-2 N protein in insect pupae (Tricoplusia ni; T. ni)

173

was performed as previously described (38). Briefly, pupae were allocated in the

174

inoculation robot that dispensed a maximum of 5 μl with the baculovirus titers

175

protein in 5 days pupae incubation time in constant temperature and humidity

176

chambers. After that period, pupae were collected and stored frozen, before

177

downstream processing. T.ni pupae containing the recombinant protein were

178

homogenized in extraction buffer. Then, subsequent steps of clarification,

179

diafiltration and His-tag purification were carried, out in order to obtain purified

180

SARS-CoV-2 N protein. Protein concentration, yield and level of purity were

181

determined by SDS-PAGE analysis using 4–20 % or 12 % Mini-Protean TGX

182

precast gels from Bio-Rad. Gels were stained with QC Colloidal stain (3 ng

183

sensitivity) in the case of concentration and yield evaluation and with SYPRO

184

Ruby (1 ng sensitivity) in the case of level purity analysis, both from Bio-Rad.

185

Recombinant SARS-CoV-2 N protein produced in pupae was measured by band

186

densitometry with the ChemiDoc™ XRS Gel Imaging System using Image Lab™

187

software (Bio-Rad). A BSA standard curve was used for quantification.

188
189

ELISA assays

190

High-binding 96-well ELISA plates (Nunc) were coated with 0.5 µg/well of purified

191

SARS-CoV-2 N protein in carbonate/bicarbonate buffer 0.05 M pH 9.6 and

192

allowed to bind over night at 4ºC. Then, endogenous human NPC1 and HSP90

193

were purified using immobilized Recombinant Protein G Resin (Generon) and 4

194

µg of specific antibodies against NPC1 (Abcam, ab108921) or HSP90 (Enzo Life

195

Sciences, ADI-SPA-835) respectively. All steps were performed as described in

196

Co-IP assays. Serial dilutions of these endogenous NPC1 and HSP90 were

197

added to the plate and capture was allowed to proceed for 1 hour at 37ºC. After

198

that, plates were washed with PBST (PBS 0.1%Tween20) and the binding of

199

NPC1 to SARS-CoV-2 N protein was detected with a rabbit anti-NPC1 antibody

200

(1:2000), revealed with an anti-rabbit-horseradish peroxidase (HRP) (1:2000)

201

using a colorimetric substrate (OPD) and finally, quantified by absorbance at 492

202

nm in the EnSight multimode plate reader of PerkinElmer. Effect of the

203

compounds on the binding was performed pre-incubating 50 µM and 100µM of

204

each compound with NPC1 1h a 37ºC before adding it to the plate.

213

resuspended in DMSO at 50 mM. Sulfides SC198 and SC073, and carbazole

214

SC816, were used at working concentrations of 5, 50 and 50 µM;

215

benzothiazepines SC397, SC593, SC567, at working concentrations of 75 µM

216

and SC338 at 100 µM respectively. The first three compounds were shown

217

previously to be active against EBOV while the others were inactive (40).

218

Compounds MBX2254 and MBX2270 were used as gold standards as they have

219

been reported to inhibit EBOV-GP/NPC1 interaction with high selectivity (41).

220

These compounds were purchased from MolPort and used at concentrations of

221

75 µM and 25 µM, respectively. Class II cationic amphiphilic compound U18666A

viability was measured by Cell Titer 96 AQueous Non-Radioactive Cell

231

Proliferation Assay (Promega) following the manufacturer´s instructions.

232

Absorbance was measured at 490 nm using an ELISA plate reader.

233

Cell viability was reported as the percentage of absorbance in treated cells

234

relative to DMSO- treated cells (Figure S3). The 50% cytotoxic concentration

235

(CC50) was calculated and non-toxic working concentrations (over 80% cell

Interaction of SARS-CoV-2 N protein with NPC1

266

To investigate the interaction of SARS-CoV-2 Nucleoprotein (N) with NPC1, N

267

protein was expressed as an EGFP-fusion protein in HEK 293T cells. Then,

268

proteins were extracted from lysed cells and assayed for immunoprecipitation (IP)

269

using a high affinity EGFP immunoprecipitation kit (GFP-Trap). Finally, protein

270

expression/interaction was confirmed by fluorescence and western blot analysis

271

(Figure 1A and 1C). This pipeline (Figure 1B) has been used to detect protein

272

interacting partners for other RNA virus such as EBOV (37, 44). HEK 293T cells

273

were selected due to their high efficiency of transfection, being the cell line of

274

choice for protein-protein interaction studies of several viruses including SARS-

275

CoV-2 (45).

276

Protein expression of EGFP-N and EGFP alone was confirmed using western

277

blot analysis and fluorescence (Figure 1A and 1C). The efficiency of transfection

278

for both plasmids was approximately 80% (Figure 1A). EGFP-N and EGFP were

279

then immunoprecipitated using an EGFP-Trap. After immunoprecipitation, both

280

input (cell lysate) and bound (or elution) samples were analysed by western blot.

281

Proteins corresponding to the molecular weight of EGFP-N (70 kDa) and the

282

EGFP empty (27 kDa) were detected using an anti-EGFP antibody (Figure 1C).

283

NPC1, as an endogenous protein, was also detected in both input samples

284

(EGFP-N and EGFP); but only in the bound fraction of EGFP-N sample (Figure

285

1C). This experiment was repeated three times to ensure reproducibility

286

(Supplementary figure S1A).

287

To further validate a specific interaction between EGFP-N and NPC1, two cellular

288

proteins were selected as negative controls. In this case, HSP90 chaperone and

289

endosomal protein EEA1 were used as controls given the abundance of these

290

proteins in cells (Figure 1C).

291
292

Validation of SARS-CoV-2 N interaction with NPC1

293

Co-immunoprecipitations against NPC1 (or reverse pull down) were performed

294

to confirm and further validate the interaction between SARS-CoV-2 N and

295

obtained from the co-immunoprecipitations were then analysed by western blot,

which confirmed the presence of SARS-CoV-2 N (Figure 1D). As a result of this

Functional assays

316

For an orthogonal characterization of the interaction, we used NPC1 inhibitor

317

drugs to inhibit human coronavirus (HCoV) infection. To do this, Huh-7 cells were

318

treated with the inhibitor compounds for an hour at different concentrations and

319

then, infected with HCoV 229E-GFP recombinant virus at a MOI of 1 pfu/ml. Cells

320

were then analysed at 16 hpi.

325

Inhibitors MBX2254 and MBX2270 (Figure 2) were selected as they target NPC1

326

with high selectivity and both have been described to inhibit HIV-pseudotyped-

327

EBOV-GP binding to NPC1 (41). MBX2254 and MBX2270 were used at 75 and

328

25 µM, respectively. We also used imipramine, a Food and Drug Administration

329

(FDA)-approved drug, that inhibits EBOV and other viruses due to its ability to

330

induce a phenotype similar to NPC1 deficiency (46).

331

Finally, we assayed a set of compounds initially selected by virtual screening of

332

the MBC chemical library in the EBOV-GP/NPC1 interaction (40). These

333

compounds were previously found to inhibit infection with EBOV pseudotyped

334

retrovirus and some of them - sulfides and carbazoles - were able to disturb the

335

NPC1-GP interaction in an ELISA assay. Compounds were classified in three

336

chemical classes, sulfides SC198 and SC073, and carbazole SC816 used at 5,

337

50 and 50 µM respectively; and benzothiazepines SC397, SC593, SC567 (Figure

338

2), that were used at 75 µM, or 100 µM of SC338. Noteworthy, sulfides and

339

carbazoles were found to potentially act through inhibition of NPC1-GP

340

interaction, while benzothiazepines do not affect this interaction (40). Based on

341

these previous results, the three classes were included in this study for

342

comparative purposes. As a reference, we used U18666A compound (10 µM),

343

known to inhibit cholesterol transport function of NPC1 and the infectious entry of

344

several viruses including EBOV and ASFV (23, 26, 42).

345

We detected that MBX2270 derivative potently inhibited HCoV infection (50%

346

inhibitory concentration IC50= 3.26 µM, selectivity index 28.36; Figure 3). In

347

general, our results yielded significant inhibition >99% of HCoV infection with the

348

U18666A compound and imipramine treatment and with sulfides from the library

349

compounds (Figure 3A). Others yielded over 80% of infectivity inhibition (except

350

for SC397 and SC338; Figure 3B). IC50 was <1 µM in several sulfide compounds

351

(SC073 IC50= 0.53 µM, Index 151.47), U18666A (IC50 0.1 µM, Index 362.34) and

352

imipramine (FDA085; IC50= 0.75 µM, Index 72.3). Full information of

353

dose/response curves for these chemicals are included in Supplementary Fig.

In addition to these functional experiments, we also tested the ability of these

365

compounds to disrupt the NPC1/SARS-CoV-2 N protein interaction in an ELISA

assay, as described in Materials and Methods. First, we tested increasing

367

concentrations of NPC1 and control protein HSP90 in plates coated with SARS-

CoV-2 N protein. We detected a positive reaction with increasing concentrations

369

of NPC1, while negative control HSP90 remained unaltered (Figure 4A). Then,

370

we analysed the inhibition of NPC1/SARS-CoV-2 N binding with a sample of the

371

compounds previously described in this study. We obtained a significant inhibition

372

of this specific binding in those samples tested with one inhibitor compound from

373

each class 100 µM SC073 and 50 or 100 µM of MBX2270 (Figure 4B).

Discussion

387
388

Current COVID-19 pandemic has affected millions of people all around the globe

389

and has been one of the mayor challenges in this century due to a great loss of

390

lives and significant economic losses (1). This highlights an urgent need for

391

developing efficient therapeutics against SARS-CoV-2 since there is no licensed

392

treatment available.

393
394

There are several pathogenic viruses, that are known to use the endocytic

395

pathway to enter the cell, the most important being EBOV. Two publications

396

described simultaneously that the endosomal protein called NPC1 or Niemann-

397

Pick type C1 is a host receptor for EBOV (21, 22). EBOV entry is mediated by

398

the viral glycoprotein (GP) which is organized in trimeric spikes at the viral surface

399

(20). NPC1 binding requires the processing of viral GP. GP cleavage by

400

endosomal cathepsins unmasks the binding site for NPC1 by removing heavily

401

glycosylated C-terminal residues and the glycan cap to produce the cleaved form

402

of the N-terminal receptor binding subunit GP1 (GPCL). Finally, GPCL-NPC1

403

binding within endosomes is required to mediate fusion and viral escape into the

404

host cytoplasm (21, 22) as a second intracellular receptor (47).

405

Thereby, NPC1 could be used as an important druggable target (22) on viral

406

infection. An example of this is compound U18666A, which blocks intracellular

407

cholesterol efflux mediated by NPC1, along with imipramine severely impacts

408

EBOV (22, 42, 43) and other viruses like HIV (23) and DENV (27, 28), CHIK (26),

409

ZIKV (29) and other Flavivirus. Knockdown or chemical impairment of NPC1

410

severely reduced cholesterol supply at the Hepatitis C virus replication sites

411

altering the replication membranous web (25).

412
413

SARS-CoV-2 infection starts with the interaction between spike glycoprotein (S)

414

with the ACE2 cellular receptor. It requires activation by the TMPRSS2 at the

415

plasma membrane. TMPRSS2 is located at the vicinity of ACE2 in lipid rafts and

416

elicits plasma membrane fusion (31) that results severely impaired using

417

chemical inhibitors of this protease (10, 11). Apart from TMPRSS2, the lysosomal

418

proteases, specifically cathepsin L, are crucial for SARS-CoV-2 entry via endo-

419

lysosomes (11). Both, TMPRSS2 and cathepsin L proteases have cumulative

420

effects along with the cleavage caused by furin at the Golgi (subsequent to S-

421

protein synthesis during viral packaging) on activating SARS-CoV-2 entry and

422

penetration in the cytoplasm.

423

SARS-CoV-2 would traffic the endocytic pathway inside the early and late

424

endosomal vesicles to finally fuse with lysosomes, an essential stage for viral

425

uncoating and fusion (31). According to that, viral infection is abrogated by drugs

426

interfering endosome acidification (11). Also, SARS-CoV-2 pseudovirions

427

infection is inhibited using drugs targeting the late endosomal compartments, like

428

cathepsin L, two-pore channel 2 (TPC2), or PIKfyve. Inhibitors against these

429

proteins dramatically reduce infection, indicating that TPC2, cathepsin L,

430

endosomal maturation, and endosomal acidic luminal pH, are crucial host factors

431

for endocytosed SARS-CoV2 entry (11, 35). Thus, late endosomes/lysosomes

432

are proposed as relevant organelles to develop therapeutic targets against

433

infection by SARS-CoV-2 (8, 11, 31-34, 48).

434

A recent study discovered that SARS-CoV-2 non-structural protein 7 (nsp7)

435

strongly interacts with Rab7a, and its depletion causes retention of ACE2

436

receptor inside late endosomes (45). Other reports highlighted the relevance of

437

a variety of proteins involved in cholesterol biosynthesis, including NPC1 infection

438

(32). Also, the cholesterol biosynthesis pathway is downregulated during SARS-

439

CoV-2 infection and, according to that, drug treatments that regulate this pathway

440

impact the infection (49).

441

Here, we described in this study an interaction between SARS-CoV-2 N protein

442

and NPC1. This interaction unveiled a novel host-based target for antivirals and

443

a potential host factor for SARS-CoV-2 infectivity. As in other viruses, this

444

interaction could possibly regulate and modify cholesterol efflux from late

445

endosomes and alter the lipid composition in cellular membranes in its own

446

benefit (50). Besides, we presented data on how several compounds that block

447

NPC1 function severely impact 229E HCoV infection in a functional assay, which

448

suggests an essential role for NPC1 in HCoV infectivity.

449

Small molecule inhibitors were crucial to determine that NPC1 was essential for

450

EBOV infection (22). Compounds MBX2254, an aminoacetamide sulfonamide,

451

and MBX2270, a triazole thioether were reported to inhibit EBOV infection with

452

high selectivity (41). All those compounds have NPC1 as a target and we found

16

453

that those chemicals strongly inhibited HCoV 229E infection. Also, compounds

454

found using the NPC1/EBOV-GP interaction for the screening of a library of

455

compounds, namely sulfides, carbazoles and benzothiazepines (shown in Figure

456

2), were tested for HCoV inhibition. We have shown that compounds that

457

inhibited EBOV-GP/NPC1 binding, namely sulfides SC073 and SC198 together

458

with carbazole SC816, and not others, presented a potent inhibition of 229E-CoV

459

infection. These chemicals have been shown to inhibit EBOV binding to NPC1

460

and the infection of EBOV-GP pseudovirions elsewhere (40). We have shown

461

here that those compounds that were able to inhibit EBOV-GP/NPC1 binding

462

were also capable to inhibit SARS-CoV-2 N protein/NPC1 binding in an ELISA

463

assay.

464

To conclude, according to other authors and recent evidences (31-34, 49), we

465

propose NPC1 as a potential therapeutic target for SARS-CoV-2 to combat

466

COVID-19 pandemic. We show for first-time experimental evidences of the

467

binding of SARS-CoV-2 Nucleoprotein (N) to NPC1. This important finding paves

468

the way to direct medical efforts and therapeutics to NPC1 and to continue

469

studies on cholesterol metabolism in SARS-CoV-2 infection.
