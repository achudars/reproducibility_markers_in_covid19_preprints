Abstract

26

The coronavirus nucleocapsid protein (N) controls viral genome packaging and contains

27

numerous phosphorylation sites located within unstructured regions. Binding of

28

phosphorylated SARS-CoV N to the host 14-3-3 protein in the cytoplasm was reported

29

to regulate nucleocytoplasmic N shuttling. All seven isoforms of the human 14-3-3 are

30

abundantly present in tissues vulnerable to SARS-CoV-2, where N can constitute up to

31

~1% of expressed proteins during infection. Although the association between 14-3-3

32

and SARS-CoV-2 N proteins can represent one of the key host-pathogen interactions,

33

its molecular mechanism and the specific critical phosphosites are unknown. Here, we

34

show that phosphorylated SARS-CoV-2 N protein (pN) dimers, reconstituted via

35

bacterial co-expression with protein kinase A, directly associate, in a phosphorylation-

36

dependent manner, with the dimeric 14-3-3 protein, but not with its monomeric mutant.

37

We demonstrate that pN is recognized by all seven human 14-3-3 isoforms with various

38

efficiencies and deduce the apparent KD to selected isoforms, showing that these are in

39

a low micromolar range. Serial truncations pinpointed a critical phosphorylation site to

40

Ser197, which is conserved among related zoonotic coronaviruses and located within

41

the functionally important, SR-rich region of N. The relatively tight 14-3-3/pN association

42

can regulate nucleocytoplasmic shuttling and other functions of N via occlusion of the

43

SR-rich region, while hijacking cellular pathways by 14-3-3 sequestration. As such, the

44

assembly may represent a valuable target for therapeutic intervention.

Introduction

48

The new coronavirus-induced disease, COVID19, has caused a worldwide health

49

crisis with more than 90 million confirmed cases and 1.9 million deaths as of January

50

2021 [1]. The pathogen responsible, Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus

51

2 (SARS-CoV-2), is highly similar to the causative agent of the SARS outbreak in 2002-

52

2003 (SARS-CoV) and, to a lesser extent, to the Middle East Respiratory Syndrome

53

Coronavirus (MERS-CoV) [2, 3]. Each is vastly more pathogenic and deadly than

54

human coronaviruses HCoV-OC43, HCoV-NL63, HCoV-229E, and HCoV-HKU1 which

55

cause seasonal respiratory diseases [4]. Like SARS-CoV and HCoV-NL63, SARS-CoV-

56

2 uses angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) as entry receptor [5]. The ACE2

57

expression roughly correlates with the evidenced SARS-CoV-2 presence in different

58

tissue types, which explains the multi-organ character of the disease [6] (Fig. 1).

59

In contrast to multiple promising COVID19 vaccine clinical trials [7-9], treatment of

60

the disease is currently limited by the absence of approved efficient drugs [10]. The

61

failure of several leading drug candidates in 2020 warrants the search for novel

62

therapeutic targets including not only viral enzymes, but also heterocomplexes involving

63

viral and host cell proteins. Unravelling mechanisms of interaction between the host and

64

pathogen proteins may provide the platform for such progress.

65

The positive-sense single-stranded RNA genome of SARS-CoV-2 coronavirus

66

encodes approximately 30 proteins which enable cell penetration, replication, viral gene

67

transcription and genome assembly amongst other functions [11]. The 46-kDa SARS-

68

CoV-2 Nucleocapsid (N) protein is 89.1% identical to SARS-CoV N. Genomic analysis

69

of human coronaviruses indicated that N might be the major factor conferring the

70

enhanced pathogenicity to SARS-CoV-2 [4]. N represents the most abundant viral

71

protein in the infected cell [12-14], with each assembled virion containing approximately

72

one thousand molecules of N [15]. Given that each infected cell can contain up to 105

73

virions (infectious, defective and incomplete overall) [14], the number of N molecules in

74

an infected cell can reach 108, accounting for ~1% of a total number of cellular proteins

75

(~1010 [16]).

76

The N protein interacts with viral genomic RNA, the membrane (M) protein and

77

self-associates to provide for the efficient virion assembly [17-19]. It consists of two

78

structured domains and three unstructured regions, including a functionally important

79

central Ser/Arg-rich region (Fig. 2A) [20-22]. Such organization allows for a vast

80

conformational change, which in combination with positively charged surfaces [23],

81

facilitates nucleic acid binding [24]. Indeed, the crystal structure of the N-terminal

82

domain (NTD) reveals an RNA binding groove [25-27], while crystal structures of the C-

83

terminal domain (CTD) show a highly interlaced dimer with additional nucleic acid

84

binding capacity [28, 29]. The N protein shows unusual properties in the presence of

85

RNA, displaying concentration-dependent liquid-liquid phase separation [22, 23, 30, 31]

86

that is pertinent to the viral genome packaging mechanism [32, 33]. In human cells, the

87

assembly of condensates is down-regulated by phosphorylation of the SR-rich region

88

[30, 34]. SARS-CoV-2 N protein is a major target of phosphorylation by host cell protein

89

kinases, with 22 phosphosites identified in vivo throughout the protein (Supplementary

90

table 1 and [13, 35]). Functions of N and viral replication can be regulated by a complex,

91

hierarchical phosphorylation of the SR-rich region of SARS-CoV-2 N by a cascade of

92

protein kinases [36]. Nevertheless, the potential functional role of N phosphorylation at

93

each specific site is not understood.

94

Using immunofluorescence, immunoprecipitation, siRNA silencing and kinase

95

inhibition, it has been shown that SARS-CoV N protein shuttles between the nucleus

96

and the cytoplasm in COS-1 cells [37]. This process is regulated by N protein

97

phosphorylation by several protein kinases including glycogen synthase kinase-3,

98

protein kinase A, casein kinase II and cyclin-dependent kinase [37-39]. Consequently,

99

phosphorylated N associates with 14-3-3 proteins in the cytoplasm [37]. Notably,

100

treatment with a kinase inhibitor cocktail eliminated the N/14-3-3 interaction, whereas

101

inhibition of 14-3-3θ expression by siRNA led to accumulation of N protein in the

102

nucleus [37]. These data suggest that 14-3-3 proteins directly shuttle SARS-CoV N

103

protein in a phosphorylation-dependent manner: a role which may be universal for N

104

proteins of all coronaviruses, including SARS-CoV-2. However, the molecular

105

mechanism of the 14-3-3/N interaction remains ill-defined.

106

14-3-3 proteins are amongst the top 1% of highest-expressed human proteins in

107

many tissues, with particular abundance in tissues vulnerable to SARS-CoV-2 infection

108

including the lungs, gastrointestinal system and brain [40, 41] (Fig. 1). 14-3-3 proteins

109

recognize hundreds of phosphorylated partner proteins involved in a magnitude of

110

cellular processes ranging from apoptosis to cytoskeleton rearrangements [42, 43].

111

Human 14-3-3 proteins are present in most of the tissues as seven conserved

112

“isoforms” (β, γ, ε, ζ, η, σ, τ/θ) (Fig. 1), with all-helical topology, forming dimers

113

possessing two identical antiparallel phosphopeptide-binding grooves, located at ~35 Å

114

distance from each other [44]. By recognizing phosphorylated Ser/Thr residues within

115

the structurally flexible (R/K)X2-3(pS/pT)X(P/G) consensus motif [44, 45], 14-3-3 binding

116

is known to regulate the stability of partner proteins, their intracellular localization and

117

interaction with other factors [46]. In addition to their high abundance in many tissues

118

susceptible to SARS-CoV-2 infection (Fig. 1), 14-3-3 proteins were reported as one of

119

nine key host proteins during SARS-CoV-2 infection [47], indicating their potential

120

association with viral proteins.

121

In this work, we dissected the molecular mechanism of the interaction between

122

SARS-CoV-2 N and human 14-3-3 proteins. SARS-CoV-2 N protein containing several

123

phosphosites reported to occur during infection, was produced using the efficient

124

Escherichia coli system that proved successful for the study of polyphosphorylated

125

proteins [48]. We have observed the direct phosphorylation-dependent association

126

between polyphosphorylated SARS-CoV-2 N and all seven human 14-3-3 isoforms and

127

determined the affinity and stoichiometry of the interaction. Series of truncated mutants

128

of N localized the key 14-3-3-binding site to a single phosphopeptide residing in the

129

functionally important SR-rich region of N. These findings suggest a topology model for

130

the heterotetrameric 14-3-3/pN assembly occluding the SR-region, which presents a

131

feasible target for further characterization and therapeutic intervention.

phosphorylated locus is the SR-rich region (Fig. 2A, Supplementary table 1,

138

Supplementary data file 1 and [13, 35]). Remarkably, this region is conserved in N

139

proteins of several coronaviruses [39, 49], including SARS-CoV (Fig. 2A). Although a

140

number of protein kinases have been implicated in SARS-CoV N phosphorylation [36,

141

37, 39, 50], the precise enzymes responsible for identified phosphosites and the

142

functional outcomes are largely unknown. Of note, many of the reported phosphosites

143

within the SARS-CoV-2 N protein are predicted to be phosphorylated by protein kinase

144

A (PKA), (Supplementary table 1). Hence, PKA was used for production of

145

phosphorylated SARS-CoV-2 N in E.coli [48], using the same approach that was

146

successfully applied for production of several phosphorylated eukaryotic proteins [48,

147

51-54] including the polyphosphorylated human tau competent for specific 14-3-3

148

binding [48].

Indeed, co-expression with PKA yielded a heavily phosphorylated SARS-CoV-2

conservation between SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 N proteins, many phosphosites

161

identified in the PKA-co-expressed N are likely shared by SARS-CoV N (Fig. 2A).

162

Importantly, many identified phosphosites lie within the regions predicted to be

163

disordered, and contribute to predicted 14-3-3-binding motifs, albeit deviating from the

164

optimal 14-3-3-binding sequence RXX(pS/pT)X(P/G) [44] (Fig. 2A and Supplementary

166

Of note, the bacterially expressed SARS-CoV-2 N protein avidly binds random

172

183

The skewed Mw distribution across the SEC peak indicated the propensity of the

184

SARS-CoV-2 N to oligomerization (Fig. 2E), which was instigated by the addition of

185

nucleic acid (Supplementary Fig. 1A and B). Using tRNA isolated from E.coli DH5

cells, SEC and agarose gel electrophoresis, we showed that our nucleic acid-free,

Polyphosphorylated SARS-CoV-2 N and human 14-3-3γ form a tight

190

191

Next, we compared the ability of native full-length SARS-CoV-2 N, both

192

unphosphorylated and polyphosphorylated (N.1-419 and pN.1-419, respectively), to be

193

recognized by a human 14-3-3 protein. For the initial analysis we chose 14-3-3γ as one

194

of the strongest phosphopeptide binders among the 14-3-3 family [55].

195

SEC-MALS (Fig. 3A) shows that 14-3-3γ elutes as a dimer with Mw of ~55.2 kDa

196

(calculated monomer Mw 28.3 kDa, see also Fig. 3B). The position and amplitude of

197

this peak did not change in the presence of the N.1-419 dimer with Mw of 94.5 kDa

(calculated monomer Mw 48 kDa) where the SEC profile shows two distinct peaks. This

is

205

human 14-3-3γ. This is evident from the peak shift and corresponding increased Mw

206

from ~95 to 150.7 kDa (Fig. 3E), perfectly matching the addition of the 14-3-3 dimer

207

mass (calculated dimer Mw 56.6 kDa) to the pN.1-419 dimer (calculated dimer Mw 96

208

kDa). The presence of both proteins in the complex was confirmed by SDS-PAGE (Fig.

209

3F). Collectively these data pointed toward the equimolar binding upon saturation.

210

Given the dimeric state of both proteins in their individual states (Fig. 2D and Fig. 3) and

211

the Mw of the 14-3-3γ/pN.1-419 complex, the most likely stoichiometry is 2:2. The ratio

212

of the proteins does not change across the peak of the complex (Fig. 3F), implying that

213

they form a relatively stable complex with the well-defined stoichiometry.

214

3. SARS-CoV-2 N interacts with all human 14-3-3 isoforms

215

We then questioned whether the interaction with pN is preserved for other human

216

14-3-3 isoforms. Analytical SEC clearly showed that the phosphorylated SARS-CoV-2 N

217

can be recognized by all seven human 14-3-3 isoforms, regardless of the presence of a

218

His-tag or disordered C-terminal tails on the corresponding 14-3-3 constructs (Fig. 4A).

219

However, the efficiency of complex formation differed for each isoform. Judging by the

220

repartition of 14-3-3 between free and the pN-bound peaks, the apparent efficiency of

221

pN binding was higher for 14-3-3γ, 14-3-3η, 14-3-3ζ and 14-3-3ε, and much lower for

222

14-3-3β, 14-3-3τ and 14-3-3σ, in a roughly descending order (Fig. 4A). The interaction

223

also appeared dependent on the oligomeric state of 14-3-3, since the monomeric

224

mutant form of 14-3-3ζ, 14-3-3ζm-S58E [56] (apparent Mw 29 kDa) showed virtually no

225

interaction relative to the wild-type dimeric 14-3-3ζ counterpart (apparent Mw 58 kDa),

226

(Fig. 4B).

This apparent variation in binding efficiency (Fig. 4A) justified more detailed

229

4. Affinity of the phosphorylated SARS-CoV-2 N towards selected human

230

14-3-3 isoforms

231

In light of the relative positions of the two proteins, separately and complexed, on

232

SEC profiles (Fig. 3 and 4), we used analytical SEC to track titration of a fixed

233

concentration of pN.1-419 (around 10 μM) against increasing quantities (0-100 μM) of

234

either of two selected full-length human 14-3-3 isoforms, γ and ε (Fig. 5A and B). A

235

saturation binding curve showed the maximal concentration of bound 14-3-3γ to

236

asymptotically approach 10 μM (Fig. 5C), supporting 2:2 stoichiometry. The apparent KD

237

of the 14-3-3γ/pN.1-419 complex was estimated as 1.5 ± 0.3 μM. A similar binding

238

mechanism could be observed for 14-3-3ε, however in this case we could achieve pN.1-

239

419 saturation only at much higher 14-3-3ε concentrations (Fig. 5B and C), and the

240

resulting apparent KD was ~7 times higher than for 14-3-3γ (Fig. 5C). Nevertheless,

241

once again the stoichiometry was close to 2:2. These findings strongly disfavor the

242

earlier hypothesis that 14-3-3 binding affects dimerization status of N [57].

We further asked what are the specific regions of SARS-CoV-2 N that are

multiple experimentally confirmed phosphosites including several suboptimal predicted

252

14-3-3-binding sites (Fig. 2A). To narrow down the 14-3-3-binding locus we used

253

several constructs representing its N- and C-terminal parts (N.1-211 and N.212-419,

254

respectively). The individual CTD included the C-terminal phosphosite around Thr265

255

(N.247-364), and the longer N-terminal construct extended toward the C-terminus to

256

include the predicted NES sequence (N.1-238) (Fig. 6A). This contains Asp225 and a

257

cluster of Leu residues which together resemble the unphosphorylated 14-3-3-binding

258

segments from ExoS/T [59] and therefore could be important for 14-3-3 binding.

259

As for the wild-type protein, the truncated SARS-CoV-2 N constructs were cloned

260

and expressed in the absence or presence of PKA to produce unphosphorylated or

261

polyphosphorylated proteins. PKA could be easily detected in the eluate from the Ni-

262

affinity column and typically led to an upward shift on SDS-PAGE and a shift on the

263

SEC profile (Supplementary Fig. 2). Each indicates efficient phosphorylation. Perhaps

264

with the exception of N.212-419, phosphorylation did not affect the oligomeric state of

265

the N constructs, and the observed shifts could be accounted for by the affected flexible

266

regions (Fig. 4 and Supplementary Fig. 2).

earlier published data [28]. A dimeric state (Mw of 47.3 kDa) was also confirmed for the

271

longer C-terminal construct, N.212-419 (Supplementary Fig. 3, calculated monomer Mw

272

273

polydispersity and tendency for oligomerization was observed (Supplementary Fig. 3).

274

In contrast, N-terminal constructs including the RNA-binding domain, such as

275

N.1-211, are monomeric (Supplementary Fig. 3). Thus, our data align with the low-

276

resolution structural model of SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 N proteins, in which the

277

CTD (residues 247-364), largely responsible for dimerization, and NTD, involved in

278

RNA-binding, are only loosely associated [24, 28, 29].

279

Of the constructs analyzed, the N-terminal constructs N.1-211 and N.1-238 both

280

interacted with 14-3-3γ by forming distinct complexes on SEC profiles, and this

281

interaction was strictly phosphorylation-dependent (Fig. 6). Given the similarity of the

282

elution profiles for pN.1-211 and pN.1-238, it may be concluded that the presence of

283

NES in the latter is dispensable for the 14-3-3 binding.

284

Under similar conditions, only a very weak interaction between the dimeric

285

pN.212-419 construct and 14-3-3γ could be observed, whereas the phosphorylated

286

dimeric

287

unphosphorylated construct interacted with 14-3-3. Thus, the Thr265 phosphosite can

288

be broadly excluded as the critical binding site. Separate phosphosites outside the CTD,

289

for instance, in the last ~30 C-terminal residues (Supplementary table 1) likely account

290

for residual binding of the pN.212-419 construct. Only its SEC profile showed a

291

significant positional peak shift with phosphorylation (Fig. 6B and C), indicating a

292

potential change in the oligomeric state. It is tempting to speculate that such

293

phosphorylation outside the CTD could affect higher order oligomerization associated

294

with the so-called N3 C-terminal segment (Fig. 2A) [20, 21, 49, 60].

296

238 monomer (Mw of 31 kDa) by forming a ~82 kDa complex (Fig. 7A) with an apparent

297

2:1 stoichiometry. It is remarkable that despite a moderate molar excess of pN.1-238 a

298

2:2 complex (one 14-3-3 dimer with two pN monomers) is not observed. The well-

299

defined 2:2 stoichiometry of the 14-3-3γ complex with the full-length pN (Fig. 3)

300

suggests that the dimeric pN is anchored using two equivalent, key 14-3-3-binding sites,

301

each located in a separate subunit of N. It is tempting to speculate that, in the absence

302

of the second subunit, the interaction involves the key phosphosite and an additional

303

phosphosite which is separated by a sufficiently long linker (≥ 15 residues [61]), to

304

secure occupation of both phosphopeptide-binding grooves of 14-3-3 (Fig. 7B). Such

305

bidentate binding would prevent the recruitment of a second pN.1-238 monomer and is

306

in line with the observed data. Similar 2:1 binding was observed qualitatively for the

307

interaction of 14-3-3γ with pN.1-211 (Fig. 6C and data not shown).

308

Our finding that the minimal N-terminal construct pN.1-211 exhibits firm binding

309

to 14-3-3γ indicates that the key 14-3-3-binding phosphosite(s) is/are located

310

exclusively within this region. Given the presence of numerous candidate 14-3-3-binding

311

sites within its most C-terminal part, i.e., the SR-rich region, we further focused on the

312

1-211 sequence in search of the 14-3-3-binding phosphosite(s).

319

position -3 (bold font) relative to the phosphorylation site (squared brackets). However,

320

each also features a Pro residue in position +2 (bold underlined font), which is highly

321

favorable for 14-3-3 binding [44] and absent from the other potential 14-3-3-binding

322

phosphosites in the SR-rich region (Fig. 2A). These conflicting factors complicate

323

predictions for the true 14-3-3 binding site. Moreover, even beyond the SR-rich region

324

the NTD is predicted to host further possible 14-3-3-binding phosphosites, including the

325

RRA[pT91]RR site, which is the highest-scoring in 14-3-3-Pred [58] prediction

326

(Supplementary table 1).

327

We conceived stepwise truncations to remove the most probable 14-3-3-binding

328

phosphosites, aiming to identify the iteration at which binding (observed for the pN.1-

329

211 construct) ceased. 14-3-3 can bind incomplete consensus motifs at the extreme C-

330

terminus of some proteins [62], so truncations were designed to remove the critical

331

phosphorylated residue. However, upstream residues of each candidate 14-3-3-binding

332

site were preserved, in light of the sheer number of overlapping potential binding motifs

333

in the SR-rich region (Fig. 8A).

334

The new truncated constructs of N, namely N.1-204, N.1-196 and N.1-179, were

335

obtained in unphosphorylated and phosphorylated states, as before, and again washed

336

with high salt to remove potentially disruptive nucleic acid. SEC-MALS confirmed the

337

monomeric state of the N-terminal N mutants (the exemplary data are presented for

338

N.1-196, Supplementary Fig. 3), consistent with the proposed architecture of the N

339

protein [21, 24].

340

None of the truncated mutants interacted with 14-3-3γ in the unphosphorylated state

341

(Fig. 8B). No binding to 14-3-3γ was detected with phosphorylated N.1-179 (Fig. 8C)

342

and only very limited binding could be observed with phosphorylated N.1-196 (Fig. 8C).

343

This strongly indicated that all phosphosites of the 1-196 segment (including at least

344

three phosphosites within the SR-rich region, i.e., Ser180, Ser188 and Ser194, see Fig.

345

8A) are dispensable for 14-3-3 binding and at most could contribute only as auxiliary

346

sites (as suggested by the scheme in Fig. 7B). This narrowed the 14-3-3-binding region

347

within SARS-CoV-2 N down to 15 residues from 196 to 211, leaving only two possible

348

sites centered at Ser197 and Thr205 (Fig. 8A).

349

By contrast, pN.1-204 showed a similar interaction with 14-3-3γ to that of pN.1-211

350

(Fig. 8C). Although we cannot fully exclude that Thr205 phosphosite contributes to 14-3-

351

3 binding in the context of the full-length pN, it is clearly not critical for 14-3-3

352

recruitment, unlike Ser197. Moreover, in contrast to Thr205, Ser197 is preserved in

353

most related coronavirus N proteins (see Fig. 2A, Fig. 9).

354

Discussion

355

In this work, we investigated the molecular association between the SARS-CoV-2

356

N protein and human phosphopeptide-binding proteins of the 14-3-3 family. The former

357

is the most abundant viral protein [12, 13], the latter is a major protein-protein

358

interaction hub involved in multiple cellular signaling cascades, expressed at high levels

359

in many human tissues including those susceptible to SARS-CoV-2 infection (Fig. 1)

360

[40]. SARS-CoV-2 N is heavily phosphorylated in infected cells [13, 35, 36], which

361

poses a significant challenge for proteomic approaches: the densely phosphorylated

362

SR-rich region alone, functionally implicated in numerous viral processes [34, 49, 63],

363

hosts seven closely spaced Arg residues (Fig. 2A). These arginines restrict the length of

364

tryptic phosphopeptides and decrease the probability of their unambiguous identification

365

and phosphosite assignment [64]. The multiplicity of implicated protein kinases

366

(including GSK-3, protein kinase C, casein kinase II and mitogen-activated protein

367

kinase [36, 37, 50]) further hinders study of specific phosphorylations. Assuming that

368

the mechanistic implication of a specific phosphorylation is independent of the acting

369

kinase, we produced polyphosphorylated N protein (pN) via bacterial co-expression with

370

a catalytic subunit of PKA. A combination of orthogonal cleavage enzymes and LC-MS

371

phosphoproteomics mapped > 20 phosphosites (Supplementary table 1) including

372

Ser23, Thr24, Ser180, Ser194, Ser197, Thr198, Ser201, Ser202, Thr205 and Thr391

373

reported recently at SARS-CoV-2 infection [13, 35]. At least six of the identified

374

phosphosites are located in the unstructured regions and represent potential 14-3-3-

375

binding sites (Fig. 2A).

376

Biochemical analysis confirmed that polyphosphorylated N is competent for

377

binding to all seven human 14-3-3 isoforms (Fig. 3 and 4), but revealed remarkable

378

variation in binding efficiency between them (Fig. 4). This was supported by the

379

quantified affinities to two selected isoforms, 14-3-3γ (KD of 1.5 µM) and 14-3-3ε (KD of

380

10.7 µM) (Fig. 5). Our observations are in line with the recent finding that 14-3-3γ and

381

14-3-3η systematically bind phosphopeptides with higher affinities than 14-3-3ε and 14-

382

3-3σ [55]. The low micromolar-range KD values compare well to those reported for other

383

physiologically relevant partners of 14-3-3 [65-67], indicating a stable and specific

384

interaction. Meanwhile, the well-defined 2:2 stoichiometry of the ~150-kDa 14-3-3/pN

385

complex, supported by titration experiments and SEC-MALS analysis (Fig. 3 and 5),

386

excludes the possibility that 14-3-3 binding disrupts pN dimerization [57]. It is

387

reasonable to assume that the principally bivalent 14-3-3 dimer [44, 46] recognizes just

388

one phosphosite in each pN subunit because a bidentate 14-3-3 binding to different

389

phosphosites within a single pN subunit would inevitably alter the observed 2:2

390

stoichiometry. Identification of the single phosphosite responsible for 14-3-3 recruitment

391

proved challenging, as none of the potential sites were a perfect match to the currently

392

known optimal 14-3-3-binding motifs [65].

393

To restrict the search, we analyzed the interaction of various N constructs with

394

14-3-3γ. This eliminated the high-scoring potential 14-3-3-binding phosphosite

395

RTApT265KAY, present in the C-terminal N fragments, as the true site of interaction

396

despite its conservation in many related coronavirus N proteins (Supplementary table 2

397

and 3). The residual binding of pN.212-419 to 14-3-3γ suggested the existence of

398

auxiliary 14-3-3-binding sites located outside the folded CTD (residues 247-364). Both

399

pN.1-211 and pN.1-238 bound 14-3-3 with equivalent efficiency suggesting the binding

400

lies between amino acid 1 and 211. Interestingly, the N-terminal constructs existed as

401

monomers (Supplementary Fig. 3), which could potentially lower the binding affinity to

402

14-3-3 dimers in light of the 2:2 stoichiometry. Nonetheless, sufficient binding was

403

clearly observed between the dimeric 14-3-3γ and the monomeric N-terminal constructs

404

(Fig. 6 and 7).

405

Truncation of the SR-rich region streamlined the search for the 14-3-3-binding

406

site to the 15-residue stretch of amino acids 196-211. This sequence hosts two

407

principally similar potential 14-3-3-binding sites, RNpS197TP and RGpT205SP (Fig. 2A

408

and C). Importantly, the proximity of these sites rules out bidentate binding to the 14-3-3

409

dimer: 14-3-3 binds in an antiparallel manner requiring a minimum of 13-15 residues

410

between phosphosites on a single peptide [44, 68]. Thus, binding to Ser197 and Thr205

411

sites must be mutually exclusive.

412

The markedly different binding between pN.1-204 and pN.1-196 to 14-3-3 (Fig. 8)

413

prompted us to propose Ser197 as the critical phosphosite. This finding aided the

414

design of a topology model for the complex (Fig. 9A), in which the 14-3-3 dimer is

415

anchored by two identical Ser197 phosphosites from the SR-rich region in the two

416

equivalent pN chains. Noteworthily, the RN(pS/pT)197TP site is conserved in not only

417

SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 but also in N proteins from several bat and pangolin

418

coronaviruses (Fig. 9B). Meanwhile, plausible phosphorylation of residue 205 is

419

possible in a smaller subset of coronaviruses (Fig. 9B).

420

The model shown in Fig. 9A notably does not exclude the possibility of 14-3-3

421

binding to alternative phosphosites under significantly different phosphorylation

422

conditions. Moreover, we speculate that hierarchical phosphorylation within the SR-rich

423

region [36] would alter 14-3-3 binding with phosphorylation at adjacent Ser/Thr

424

residues, likely to inhibit the interaction [69]. The SR-rich region is phosphorylated by

425

both Pro-directed and non-Pro-directed protein kinases [36, 37, 39, 50]. Since 14-3-3

426

proteins typically reject peptides with a proline adjacent to the phosphorylated residue,

427

the interplay between these aforementioned kinases could be regulatory. In theory, this

428

could create a phosphorylation code and conditional binding of 14-3-3, as has been

429

discussed recently for alternative polyphosphorylated 14-3-3 partners such as LRRK2,

430

CFTR and tau protein [48, 67, 70, 71].

431

The recruitment of the 14-3-3 dimer is expected to occlude the SR-rich region of

432

N by masking 10-20 residues surrounding the Ser197 phosphosite within the complex.

433

Apart from the likely effects on the properties of N and its ability to phase separate and

434

bind RNA, the 14-3-3 binding at the SR-rich region, triggered by its phosphorylation, can

435

potentially interfere with N binding to the M protein, an event clearly relevant to the

436

virion assembly [17]. In support of this hypothesis, the 14-3-3-occluded area reported

437

here overlaps with the N region (residues 168-208) proposed to mediate its association

438

with the M protein in SARS-CoV [19].

439

The presence of SR-rich regions in many viral N proteins suggests a more broad

440

interaction of 14-3-3 with N proteins. Indeed, using 14-3-3-Pred prediction [58] a

441

number of 14-3-3-binding phosphosites in N proteins from human (Supplementary table

442

2) and bat coronaviruses (Supplementary table 3) could be identified. Some display

443

strong conservation of the 14-3-3-binding binding site around Ser197 (Fig. 9B), whereas

444

others contain separate high-scoring potential 14-3-3-binding sites beyond the SR-rich

445

region. Given the reasonable threat that other zoonotic coronaviruses may ultimately

446

enter the human population [72, 73], the relevant N proteins are highly likely to undergo

447

phosphorylation and 14-3-3 binding, as seen for SARS-CoV-2 N. This is particularly

448

likely, given the high concentration of both proteins in the infected cells (see above).

449

Our findings underline the essential role of the SR-rich region in the biology of N

450

proteins and host-virus interactions [49]. Unrelated proteins with similar domains also

451

tend to show RNA-binding capability (e.g., the splicing factors) [74, 75] and are subject

452

to multisite phosphorylation [76]. Such proteins are often associated with phase

453

separation as a means to regulate membraneless compartmentalization within the

454

cytoplasm. Likewise, SARS-CoV-2 N protein has been shown to undergo phase

455

separation in vitro upon RNA addition: a phenomenon dependent on the concentration

458

RNA-polymerase

459

ribonucleoproteins forming phase separated granules which can aid SARS-CoV-2

460

replication [30, 34]. Thus 14-3-3 potentially influences phase separation by binding the

nearby (Fig. 2A). This in turn may impact nucleocytoplasmic shuttling of N, as seen for

464

Conclusively, 14-3-3 binding to the SR-rich region of N holds potential to regulate

465

multiple cell host processes affected by N. 14-3-3 binding to pN may present a cell

466

immune-like response to the viral infection aimed at arresting or neutralizing N activities

467

[57]. On the other hand, in light of the abundance of N protein in the infected cell [12,

468

13], pN may instead arrest 14-3-3 proteins in the cytoplasm and indirectly disrupt

469

cellular processes involving 14-3-3. For example, 14-3-3ε and 14-3-3η each play a role

470

in the innate immune response via RIG-1 and MDA5 signaling respectively [79, 80]. The

471

N protein:14-3-3 interaction would modulate these and other signaling pathways

472

involving 14-3-3 proteins. As such, understanding the molecular mechanism of pN

association with 14-3-3 proteins may inform the development of novel therapeutic

approaches.

Truncated mutants of N.1-211, namely N.1-179, N.1-196 and N.1-204 were

489

derived from the wild-type N plasmid using the standard T7 forward primer with varying

490

reverse primers listed in Supplementary table 4. Each carried a BamHI site to enable

491

consequent cloning into a pET28 vector using NcoI and BamHI sites. This preserved

492

the N-terminal His6-tag cleavable by 3C protease. All constructs were validated by DNA

493

sequencing.

501

cloned into pProExHtb vector and carrying TEV-cleavable His6-tags on their N-terminal

502

ends were obtained as described previously [66, 85]. The monomeric mutant form of

503

untagged full-length human 14-3-3ζ carrying monomerizing amino acid substitutions

504

and pseudophosphorylation in the subunit interface (14-3-3ζm-S58E) was obtained as

505

before [56].

506

14-3-3γ, 14-3-3ζ and 14-3-3ζm-S58E were expressed and purified using

507

ammonium sulfate fractionation and column chromatography as previously described

508

[82]. His6-tagged N.247-364 was also expressed and purified as before [28]. All other

509

proteins carrying cleavable His6-tags were expressed in E.coli BL21(DE3) cells and

510

purified using subtractive immobilized metal-affinity chromatography (IMAC) and gel-

511

filtration. For the N protein and its various constructs the eluate from the first IMAC

512

column, performed at 1 M NaCl, harbored a significant quantity of random bound

513

nucleic acid (the 260/280 nm absorbance ratio of 1.7-2.0). This necessitated an

514

additional long on-column washing step with 3 M NaCl (50 column volumes) to ensure

515

the 260/280 nm absorbance ratio of ~0.6 and removal of all nucleic acid. Tagless N

516

protein was purified after treatment of cell lysate with RNAse, using heparin and

517

subsequent ion-exchange chromatography on a sulfopropyl Sepharose (elution

518

gradients 100-1000 mM NaCl) followed by gel-filtration. Here, It proved challenging to

519

entirely eliminate nucleic acid and the typical 260/280 nm absorbance ratio was 0.7-0.9.

520

Protein concentration was determined by spectrophotometry at 280 nm on a N80

521

Nanophotometer (Implen, Munich, Germany) using sequence-specific extinction

522

coefficients calculated using the ProtParam tool in ExPASy (see Supplementary table

Isolation of E.coli tRNA

525

The DH5

cells were incubated in 30 ml of liquid medium (LB without antibiotics)

526

for 16 h at 37 °C with maximum aeration and then harvested by centrifugation at 7000 g

527

for 10 min. The pellet was gently resuspended in RNAse-free Tris-acetate buffer,

528

followed by alkali-SDS lysis and neutralization by cold ammonium acetate. The

529

suspension was incubated on ice for 5 min and centrifuged at 21000 g at 4 °C for 10

530

min. The resulting supernatant (8 ml) was incubated with 12.5 ml isopropanol for 15 min

531

at 25 °C and centrifuged at 12100 g for 5 min. The pellet was resuspended in 800 µl of

532

2 M ammonium acetate, incubated for 5 min at 25 °C and centrifuged (12100 g, 10 min).

533

RNA was precipitated from supernatant by 800 µl of isopropanol, incubated for 5 min at

534

25 °C and centrifuged (12100 g, 5 min). After supernatant removal the pellet was

SARS-CoV-2 N protein co-expression with PKA

537

For phosphorylation in cells, SARS-CoV-2 N was bacterially co-expressed with a

538

catalytic subunit of mouse protein kinase A (PKA), as described previously [48]. PKA

539

was cloned into a low-copy pACYC vector [48] which ensured that the target protein

540

was expressed in excess of kinase.

541

PKA and SARS-CoV-2 N were co-transformed into E.coli BL21(DE3) cells

542

against Kanamycin and Chloramphenicol resistance. Cells were grown in LB to an

543

OD600 reading of 0.6 before inducing with 500 µM of IPTG. After induction, cultivation

544

was continued for 1.5 h, 3 h, 4 h and overnight at 37

545

expressed proteins in the absence of PKA.

548

The cells with overexpressed proteins were harvested by centrifugation and

549

resuspended in 20 mM Tris-HCl buffer pH 8.0 containing 1 M NaCl, 10 mM imidazole,

550

0.01 mM phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, as well as trace amounts of lysozyme to

551

facilitate lysis. Phosphorylated proteins were purified using subtractive IMAC and gel-

552

filtration, whereby the His6-tagged PKA was efficiently removed. Phosphorylated N and

553

its constructs typically showed significant shifts on SDS-PAGE and PhosTag gels

An aliquot (35 μg) was subjected to enzymatic hydrolysis “in solution” either with trypsin

559

(Sequencing Grade Modified Trypsin, Promega) or with chymotrypsin (Analytical Grade,

560

Sigma-Aldrich). Briefly, the sample preparation was as follows. The sample was

reduced with 2 mM Tris(2-carboxyethyl)phosphine (TCEP) and then alkylated with 4

562

mM S-Methyl methanethiosulfonate (MMTS); a protein:enzyme ratio was kept at 50:1

565

to pH 2 with formic acid. The resulting peptides were purified on a custom micro-tip SPE

566

column with Oasis HLB (Waters) as a stationary phase, using elution with an

567

acetonitrile:water:formic acid mix (50:49.9:0.1 v/v/v%). The eluate of resulting peptides

572

Thermo Fisher Scientific). Briefly, the protocol was as follows. Dried peptide samples

573

were rehydrated with 0.1% formic acid. An aliquot of rehydrated peptides (5 μl) was

574

injected onto a precolumn (100 μm x 2 cm, Reprosil-Pur C18-AQ 1.9 μm, Dr. Maisch

575

576

Dr. Maisch GmbH) with a linear gradient of mobile phase A (water:formic acid 99.9:0.1

v/v%) with mobile phase B (acetonitrile:water:formic acid 80:19.9:0.1 v/v/v%) from 2%

578

till 80% B within 80 min. MS data were acquired by a data-dependent acquisition

579

approach after a MS-scan of a 350−1500 m/z range. Top 12 peaks were subjected to

580

high collision energy dissociation (HCD) or electron transfer dissociation (ETD). After a

581

round of MS/MS, masses were dynamically excluded from further analysis for 35 s.

MS data analysis. For Mascot (MatrixScience) database search, raw LC-MS

583

files were converted to general mgf format using MSConvert with its default settings.

584

For peptide database search, a concatenated database including SARS-CoV-2 and

585

general contaminants was constructed. The parameters of the search were: Enzyme –

586

Trypsin with one miscleavage allowed, or in case of Chymotrypsin - no enzyme; MS

587

tolerance – 5 ppm; MSMS – 0.2 Da; Fixed modifications – Methylthio(C); Variable

588

modifications – Phospho(ST), Phospho(Y), Oxidation(M). For PEAKS (PEAKS Studio

589

Xpro, Bioinformatics Solutions Inc.) analysis the parameters of a search were MS

590

tolerance - 10 ppm, MSMS – 0.05 Da; Fixed modifications – Methylthio(C); Variable

591

modifications – Phospho(STY), Oxidation(M), Ammonia-loss (N), Deamidation (NQ).

Analytical size-exclusion chromatography (SEC)

594

The oligomeric state of proteins as well as protein-protein and protein-tRNA

595

interactions were analyzed by loading 50 µl samples on a Superdex 200 Increase 5/150

596

column (GE Healthcare) operated at a 0.45 ml/min flow rate using a Varian ProStar 335

597

system (Varian Inc., Melbourne, Australia). When specified, a Superdex 200 Increase

598

10/300 column (GE Healthcare) operated at a 0.8 ml/min flow rate was used (100 µl

599

loading). The columns were equilibrated by a 20 mM Tris-HCl buffer, pH 7.6, containing

600

200 mM NaCl and 3 mM NaN3 (SEC buffer) and calibrated by the following protein

601

markers: BSA trimer (198 kDa), BSA dimer (132 kDa), BSA monomer (66 kDa),

602

ovalbumin (43 kDa), α-lactalbumin (15 kDa). The profiles were followed by 280 nm and

603

(optionally) at 260 nm absorbance. Diode array detector data were used to retrieve full-

604

absorbance spectral information about the eluted samples including protein and nucleic

605

acid. All SEC experiments were performed at least three times and the most typical

606

results are presented.

607

To assess binding parameters for the 14-3-3/pN.1-419 interaction, we used serial

608

loading of the samples containing a fixed pN concentration and increasing

609

concentrations of 14-3-3 in a constant volume of 50 µl and a Superdex 200 Increase

610

5/150 column operated at 0.45 ml/min. To validate linear augmentation of the peak

611

amplitude with increasing protein concentration, serial loading of 14-3-3 alone at

612

different concentrations was used. Such linear dependence allowed conversion of the

613

amplitude of the 14-3-3 peak into the molar concentration of its unbound form at each

614

point of titration. Concentration of pN-bound 14-3-3 was determined as the difference

between the total and free concentration. Binding curves representing the dependence

616

of bound 14-3-3 on its total concentration were approximated using the quadratic

617

equation to determine apparent KD values. Graphing and fitting were performed in

Size-exclusion chromatography coupled to multi-angle light scattering (SEC-MALS)

620

To determine the absolute masses of various N constructs and their complexes

621

with 14-3-3, we coupled a SEC column to a ProStar 335 UV/Vis detector (Varian Inc.,

622

Melbourne, Australia) and a multi-angle laser light scattering detector miniDAWN (Wyatt

623

Technologies). Either Superdex 200 Increase 10/300 (~24 ml, flow rate 0.8 ml/min) or

624

Superdex 200 Increase 5/150 (~3 ml, flow rate 0.45 ml/min) columns (GE Healthcare)

625

were used. The miniDAWN detector was calibrated relative to the scattering from

626

toluene and, together with concentration estimates obtained from UV detector at 280

627

nm, was exploited for determining the Mw distribution of the eluted protein species. All

628

processing was performed in ASTRA 8.0 software (Wyatt Technologies) taking dn/dc

629

equal to 0.185 and using extinction coefficients listed in Supplementary table 5. Protein

630

content in the eluted peaks was additionally analyzed by SDS-PAGE.

Fig. 1. 14-3-3 proteins are highly abundant in human tissues with SARS-CoV-2
presence. Correlation of ACE2 expression levels (*) and SARS-CoV-2 reported
presence (**) in various tissues of COVID19 patients based on the data from [6], shown
with abundances (indicated in ppm, part per million, i.e., one molecule of a given protein
per 1 million of all proteins from a given tissue) of the seven human 14-3-3 isoforms,
extracted from the PAXdb database [40]. Different tissues are shown in the order
corresponding to the SARS-CoV-2 presence, starting, at the top, from the highest virus
presence [6]. The shown relative scale of ACE2 expression is also taken from [6]. The
total abundance of the seven human 14-3-3 isoforms in a given tissue and the average
abundance of an isoform in 12 selected tissues are also indicated. The latter values
were used for ordering the data for 14-3-3 isoforms, left to right, from the highest
average abundance (14-3-3ζ; 2423 ppm, or ~0.24%) to the lowest average abundance
(14-3-3η; 575 ppm, or ~0.06%). Note that the average abundance of all seven 14-3-3
proteins in three tissues with the highest SARS-CoV-2 presence (oral cavity,
gastrointestinal tract, lungs) reaches 1.21% of all proteins.

phosphorylatable section of the CTD are shown aligned between SARS-CoV and
SARS-CoV-2 N proteins, highlighting multiple conserved phosphorylation sites (bold
font indicates phosphosites present in both N proteins and experimentally confirmed for
SARS-CoV-2 N). Some phosphosites (red spheres and labeled) are predicted as
suboptimal 14-3-3 binding sites (green arrows). B. A Phos-tag gel showing that bacterial

fragmentation spectrum of the representative phosphopeptide carrying phosphorylation
at Ser197 and Thr205. Z- (red) and c-series (blue) of ETD fragmentation are shown.
Error did not exceed 5 ppm. D. Absorbance spectra show that both recombinant
unphosphorylated and PKA-phosphorylated N proteins elute from the Ni-affinity column
bound to random E.coli nucleic acid. On-column washing with 3 M NaCl (50 column
volumes) eliminates bound nucleic acid. E. Analysis of the oligomeric state of pN using
size-exclusion chromatography on a Superdex 200 Increase 10/300 column at 200 mM
NaCl, with multi-angle light scattering detection (SEC-MALS) and SDS-PAGE of the
eluted fractions. Flow rate was 0.8 ml/min. Apparent Mw determined from column
calibration based on protein standards (arrows above) is compared to the absolute
mass determined from SEC-MALS. The experiments were carried out three times, and
the most typical results are shown.

Fig. 3. Interaction of SARS-CoV-2 N with human 14-3-3γ. Interaction between SARSCoV-2 N protein (50 μM) and human 14-3-3γ (160 μM) was analyzed by SEC-MALS
and SDS-PAGE of the eluted fractions. SEC-MALS/SDS-PAGE of 14-3-3γ alone (A,B),
with unphosphorylated N (C,D) and with phosphorylated N (E,F) are presented. Mw
distributions obtained using MALS are shown on each peak. “L” shows contents of the
samples loaded on a column, elution volumes corresponding to the maxima of the
peaks are indicated by arrows below the gels. Mw markers are shown to the left of each
gel. A black bar on panel F indicates the fractions of the complex between 14-3-3γ and
pN. A Superdex 200 Increase 10/300 column equilibrated with 20 mM Tris-HCl buffer
pH 7.6 containing 200 mM NaCl and 3 mM NaN3 was operated at a flow rate of 0.8

not with the monomeric mutant of 14-3-3ζ. A. Interaction between phosphorylated N
protein (46.6 μM) and human isoforms 14-3-3γ (69.4 μM), his-tagged 14-3-3γΔC (73.9
μM), his-tagged 14-3-3ηΔC (73.8 μM), 14-3-3ζ (77.6 μM), his-tagged 14-3-3ε (76.2 μM),
14-3-3εΔC (60.3 μM), 14-3-3βΔC (69.4 μM), 14-3-3τΔC (71.7 μM), 14-3-3σΔC (75.4
μM) studied by analytical SEC on a Superdex 200 Increase 5/150 column at 200 mM
NaCl. B. Phosphorylated N protein (46.6 μM) interacts with the wild-type dimeric 14-3-3ζ
(77.6 μM) but not with its monomeric mutant 14-3-3ζm-S58E (74.9 μM). Apparent Mw
indicated in kDa were determined from column calibration.

Fig. 5. Binding affinity. pN at a fixed concentration (~10 μM) was titrated against either
of the two human 14-3-3 isoforms and monitored by analytical SEC with serial sample
loading. A. Titration of pN with 14-3-3γ. B. Titration of pN with 14-3-3ε. Changes of the
elution profiles associated with the increasing 14-3-3 concentration are shown by
arrows. C. Binding curves used for apparent KD determination. Note that, regardless of
the observed differences in the affinities, the maximum 14-3-3 concentration complexed
with pN equals the concentration of pN (~10 μM) for both 14-3-3 isoforms. Typical
results from two independent experiments are shown.

Fig. 6. Interaction of human 14-3-3γ with individual SARS-CoV-2 N protein
domains. A. Schematic representation of the N protein sequence with the main
domains/regions highlighted. Yellow indicates NES, small red circles designate
phosphosites within the two corresponding phosphorylatable loci. B. SEC profiles of
individual 14-3-3γ (black traces), individual N (red traces), and 14-3-3 with N (blue
traces) obtained using a Superdex 200 Increase 5/150 column at 200 mM NaCl in
running buffer and operated at a 0.45 ml/min flow rate. The upper row corresponds to
unphosphorylated N fragments, the bottom row corresponds to their phosphorylated
counterparts, as indicated on each panel. In all cases, 50 μM of N was mixed with 50
μM of 14-3-3 and loaded in an equal volume of 50 μl. In the case of N.247-364 and
pN.247-364, 90 μM of N was used. Note that the well-defined complexes with 14-3-3
were observed only for pN.1-211 and pN.1-238 fragments. The experiment was
repeated twice and the most typical results are presented.

Fig. 7. Interaction of human 14-3-3γ with the phosphorylated monomeric SARSCoV-2 N construct 1-238. A. SEC-MALS analysis of individual pN, 14-3-3γ and their
complex formed at the indicated molar excess of pN. Protein concentration, MALSderived Mw distributions across the peaks and the respective average Mw values are
indicated. Note that the difference shown by a two-headed arrow roughly corresponds
to a pN.1-238 monomer mass. B. Schematic representation of the possible bidentate
binding mode where the 14-3-3 dimer interacts with the tentative key 14-3-3-binding
phosphosite and another sterically allowed phosphosite separated by a sufficiently long
linker.

Fig. 8. Localization of the 14-3-3-binding sites within the SR-rich region of the
SARS-CoV-2 N protein. A. Sequence of the SR-rich region showing potential 14-3-3binding sites (green and blue font) and the truncations designed to exclude one or two
main 14-3-3-binding sites (blue font). # denotes the designed C-terminus. B, C. Analysis
by SEC of the interaction between human 14-3-3γ and the truncated mutants of SARSCoV-2 N in their unphosphorylated (B) or phosphorylated forms (C). Each graph
contains SEC profiles for the individual 14-3-3 (black line), individual N or pN construct
(red line), and the 14-3-3γ N/pN mixture (blue line) where 50 μM of each protein was
used throughout. Inserts on panel C show the upward shift on SDS-PAGE as the result
of phosphorylation (U, unphosphorylated; P, phosphorylated protein, arrowheads
indicate the shift). Note that only the phosphorylated mutants interacted with 14-3-3γ
and that only pN.1-211 and pN.1-204 formed a defined complex with 14-3-3γ. Column:
Superdex 200 Increase 5/150, flow rate: 0.45 ml/min. The experiment was repeated
twice and the most typical results are presented.

Fig. 9. Association of SARS-CoV-2 N with human 14-3-3. A. A topology model for the
complex of SARS-CoV-2 N protein dimer with the dimer of human 14-3-3 illustrating the
occlusion of the SR-rich region. B. Local alignment of SR-rich regions of the most
similar coronavirus N proteins in order of descending sequence identity (s.id.)
determined using entire N protein sequences. Alignment was performed using Clustal
omega and visualized using Mview (https://www.ebi.ac.uk/Tools/msa/mview/). Residues
identical to those in the SARS-CoV-2 sequence are shadowed by grey,
phosphorylatable residues in positions 197 and 205 are in green color, residues
blocking phosphorylation in position 205 are in red.
