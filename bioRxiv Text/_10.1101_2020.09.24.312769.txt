Abstract

18

Identifying drugs that regulate severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-

19

CoV-2) infection and its symptoms has been a pressing area of investigation during the

20

coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic. Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs),

21

which are frequently used for the relief of pain and inflammation, could modulate both SARS-CoV-

22

2 infection and the host response to the virus. NSAIDs inhibit the enzymes cyclooxygenase-1

23

(COX-1) and cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2), which mediate the production of prostaglandins (PGs).

24

PGE2, one of the most abundant PGs, has diverse biological roles in homeostasis and

25

inflammatory responses. Previous studies have shown that NSAID treatment or inhibition of PGE2

26

receptor signaling leads to upregulation of angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2), the cell entry

27

receptor for SARS-CoV-2, thus raising concerns that NSAIDs could increase susceptibility to

28

infection. COX/PGE2 signaling has also been shown to regulate the replication of many viruses,

29

but it is not yet known whether it plays a role in SARS-CoV-2 replication. The purpose of this study

30

was to dissect the effect of NSAIDs on COVID-19 in terms of SARS-CoV-2 entry and replication.

31

We found that SARS-CoV-2 infection induced COX-2 upregulation in diverse human cell culture

32

and mouse systems. However, suppression of COX-2/PGE2 signaling by two commonly used

33

NSAIDs, ibuprofen and meloxicam, had no effect on ACE2 expression, viral entry, or viral

34

replication. Our findings suggest that COX-2 signaling driven by SARS-CoV-2 may instead play

35

a role in regulating the lung inflammation and injury observed in COVID-19 patients.

Importance

37

Public health officials have raised concerns about the use of nonsteroidal anti-

38

inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) for treating symptoms of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19),

39

which is caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). NSAIDs

40

function by inhibiting the enzymes cyclooxygenase-1 (COX-1) and cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2).

41

These enzymes are critical for the generation of prostaglandins, lipid molecules with diverse roles

42

in maintaining homeostasis as well as regulating the inflammatory response. While COX-1/COX-

43

2 signaling pathways have been shown to affect the replication of many viruses, their effect on

44

SARS-CoV-2 infection remains unknown. We found that SARS-CoV-2 infection induced COX-2

45

expression in both human cell culture systems and mouse models. However, inhibition of COX-2

46

activity with NSAIDs did not affect SARS-CoV-2 entry or replication. Our findings suggest that

47

COX-2 signaling may instead regulate the lung inflammation observed in COVID-19 patients,

48

which is an important area for future studies.

Introduction

50

During the ongoing coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic, a common concern

51

has been whether widely used anti-inflammatory medications affect the risk of infection by severe

52

acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), the causative agent of COVID-19, or

53

disease severity. Used ubiquitously for the relief of pain and inflammation, nonsteroidal anti-

54

inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) have been one such target of concern, with the health minister of

55

France and the medical director of the National Health Service of England recommending the use

56

of acetaminophen over NSAIDs for treating COVID-19 symptoms (1, 2).

57

NSAIDs function by inhibiting the cyclooxygenase (COX) isoforms COX-1 and COX-2.

58

COX-1 is constitutively expressed in most cells, while COX-2 expression is induced by

59

inflammatory stimuli (3). COX-1 and COX-2 metabolize arachidonic acid into prostaglandin H2,

60

which can then be converted to several different bioactive prostaglandins (PGs) (3). Prostaglandin

61

E2 (PGE2) is one of the most abundant PGs in the body and signals through four receptors (EP1,

62

EP2, EP3, and EP4) to perform diverse roles, such as regulating immune responses and

63

gastrointestinal barrier integrity (3). Several potential hypotheses have linked NSAID use to

64

COVID-19 pathogenesis. First, it has been suggested that NSAID use may upregulate

65

angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2), the cell entry receptor for SARS-CoV-2, and increase

66

the risk of infection (4, 5). Second, given their anti-inflammatory properties, NSAIDs may impair

67

the immune response to SARS-CoV-2 and delay disease resolution (1). Third, NSAIDs may also

68

directly affect SARS-CoV-2 replication, as COX/PGE2 signaling has been shown to regulate

69

replication of other viruses including mouse coronavirus (6). Therefore, given the widespread use

70

of NSAIDs, evaluation of the interaction between NSAIDs and SARS-CoV-2 entry and replication

71

is warranted.

72

NSAIDs may modulate multiple stages of the SARS-CoV-2 life cycle. As described above,

73

one potential mechanism is that NSAIDs could lead to ACE2 upregulation and thus increase the

74

susceptibility to SARS-CoV-2. Ibuprofen treatment of diabetic rats was found to increase ACE2

75

expression in the heart (7), though it was not studied whether the same occurs in non-diabetic

76

rats. In addition, inhibition of the PGE2 receptor EP4 in human and mouse intestinal organoids

77

increases ACE2 expression (8), suggesting that NSAID inhibition of COX/PGE2 signaling could

78

similarly lead to ACE2 upregulation. NSAIDs could also affect a later stage of the SARS-CoV-2

79

life cycle. For porcine sapovirus, feline calicivirus, murine norovirus, and mouse coronavirus, COX

80

inhibition impaired viral replication (6, 9, 10). COX inhibition was found to impair mouse

81

coronavirus infection at a post-binding step early in the replication cycle, potentially entry or initial

82

genome replication (6). Furthermore, SARS-CoV, the closest relative of SARS-CoV-2 among

83

human coronaviruses and cause of the 2002-2003 epidemic (11), stimulates COX-2 expression

84

via its spike protein and nucleocapsid protein (12, 13), indicating the potential relevance of this

85

pathway for SARS-CoV-2.

86

Here, we assessed the relevance of COX-2/PGE2 signaling and inhibition by NSAIDs for

87

SARS-CoV-2 infection. We found that SARS-CoV-2 infection induces COX-2 expression in

88

human cells and mice. However, suppression of COX-2/PGE2 signaling by two commonly used

89

NSAIDs, ibuprofen and meloxicam, had no effect on ACE2 expression, viral entry, or viral

90

replication. Together, this suggests that NSAID use in humans is unlikely to have adverse effects

91

on SARS-CoV-2 transmission or pathogenesis.

Results

93

To determine whether the COX-2/PGE2 pathway is relevant for SARS-CoV-2 infection, we

94

evaluated induction of PTGS2 (encoding COX-2) in human cells and mice. We found that SARS-

95

CoV-2 infection of human lung cancer cell line Calu-3 led to significant upregulation of PTGS2

96

(Fig. 1A). This is consistent with RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) datasets of SARS-CoV-2-infected

97

Calu-3 cells and ACE2-overexpressing A549 cells, another lung cancer cell line (Fig. 1B-C) (14).

98

However, infection of human liver cancer cell line Huh7.5 did not lead to significant PTGS2

99

induction, demonstrating cell type specificity of PTGS2 induction by SARS-CoV-2 (Fig. 1D).

100

We next assessed whether SARS-CoV-2 induces PTGS2 in a more physiologically

101

relevant cell culture system. We cultured primary human bronchial epithelial cells (HBECs) for 28

102

days at an air-liquid interface, which supports pseudostratified mucociliated differentiation

103

providing an in vitro model of airway epithelium (15). We infected HBECs with SARS-CoV-2 at

104

the apical surface of the culture and then performed single-cell RNA sequencing at 1, 2, and 3

105

days post infection (dpi) (16). As we previously reported that ciliated cells in air-liquid interface

106

cultures are the major target of infection (16), we looked for PTGS2 induction in this cell type.

107

Aggregating ciliated cells across the three time points, we found that infected ciliated cells

108

expressed higher levels of PTGS2 compared to uninfected bystander ciliated cells (Fig. 1E),

109

indicating that PTGS2 is also induced by SARS-CoV-2 in a cell-intrinsic manner in ciliated cells,

110

a physiologically relevant target cell.

111

To determine the relevance of these findings in vivo, we utilized transgenic mice

112

expressing human ACE2 driven by the epithelial cell keratin 18 promoter (K18-hACE2) (17). As

113

SARS-CoV-2 does not efficiently interact with mouse ACE2 (4), human ACE2-expressing mice

114

are required to support SARS-CoV-2 infection (18–23). K18-hACE2 mice were initially developed

115

as a model of SARS-CoV infection and have recently been demonstrated as a model of severe

116

SARS-CoV-2 infection in the lung (17, 24). We found that intranasal infection of K18-hACE2 mice

117

with SARS-CoV-2 led to significant upregulation of Ptgs2 in the lung at multiple time points post

118

infection (Fig. 1F), consistent with recent SARS-CoV-2-infected K18-hACE2 lung RNA-seq data

119

(Fig. 1G) (24). Taken together, these results demonstrate that SARS-CoV-2 infection induces

120

PTGS2 in diverse in vitro and in vivo airway and lung systems, across multiple independent

121

studies. These findings therefore suggest that COX-2/PGE2 signaling may be a relevant pathway

122

for regulating SARS-CoV-2 infection and replication.

123

We next explored whether inhibition of the COX-2/PGE2 pathway could affect viral

124

infection by regulating ACE2 expression, as has been reported in studies of diabetic rats and

125

intestinal organoids (7, 8). We utilized two NSAIDs, nonselective COX-1/COX-2 inhibitor

126

ibuprofen and selective COX-2 inhibitor meloxicam, which are common in clinical use. We

127

determined the maximum non-toxic doses of ibuprofen and meloxicam to use on Calu-3 and

128

Huh7.5 cells (Fig. 2A-B) and validated their functionality on Calu-3 cells, which produce PGE2 at

129

baseline (Fig. 2C). Treatment of Calu-3 or Huh7.5 cells with ibuprofen or meloxicam did not

130

significantly affect ACE2 expression (Fig. 2D-E). To test whether NSAID treatment affects Ace2

131

expression in diverse tissues in vivo, we treated C57BL/6 mice with therapeutic doses of ibuprofen

132

and meloxicam (25, 26), which did not lead to changes in Ace2 expression in the lung, heart,

133

kidney, or ileum (Fig. 3A-D). These data indicate that inhibition of the COX-2/PGE2 pathway by

134

NSAIDs does not affect ACE2 expression, and therefore susceptibility to infection, in multiple cell

135

and tissue types in vitro or in vivo.

136

To functionally confirm that NSAID treatment does not affect SARS-CoV-2 entry, we used

137

a SARS-CoV-2 spike protein-pseudotyped vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV) core expressing

138

Renilla luciferase (SARS2-VSVpp) and VSV glycoprotein-typed virus (G-VSVpp) as a control (27).

139

Quantification of luciferase activity showed that pre-treatment of Calu-3 or Huh7.5 cells with

140

ibuprofen or meloxicam did not significantly affect SARS2-VSVpp or G-VSVpp entry (Fig. 4A-B),

141

confirming that NSAID inhibition of the COX-2/PGE2 pathway does not impact susceptibility to

142

infection.

Finally, we studied whether inhibition of the COX-2/PGE2 pathway affects SARS-CoV-2

144

replication. Viruses from several different families have been shown to induce COX-2/PGE2

145

signaling in host cells (28). The COX-2/PGE2 pathway is pro-viral for viruses such as porcine

146

sapovirus, as PGE2 inhibits nitric oxide production, thus permitting viral replication (9). However,

147

PGE2 can also be anti-viral in the case of parainfluenza 3 virus, potentially by inducing cAMP and

148

impairing nucleic acid synthesis (29). To this end, we utilized a replication-competent SARS-CoV-

149

2 expressing a mNeonGreen reporter (icSARS-CoV-2-mNG) to study the effect of COX-2/PGE2

150

inhibition by NSAIDs on viral replication (30). We assessed icSARS-CoV-2-mNG replication in

151

Calu-3 cells, which upregulate PTGS2 in response to SARS-CoV-2 infection (Fig. 1A-B), and

152

Huh7.5 cells, which do not (Fig. 1D). Huh7.5 cells served as a control for assessing potential

153

COX-independent effects of NSAIDs on viral replication, as has been observed with indomethacin,

154

another NSAID, during SARS-CoV infection (31). By quantifying the percentage of mNeonGreen-

155

expressing cells, we found that treatment of Calu-3 or Huh7.5 cells with ibuprofen or meloxicam

156

did not impact icSARS-CoV-2-mNG replication (Fig. 4C-D). These results indicate that SARS-

157

CoV-2 induction of the COX-2/PGE2 pathway in Calu-3 human lung cells does not regulate viral

158

replication. Furthermore, ibuprofen and meloxicam do not affect SARS-CoV-2 replication in

159

Huh7.5 cells in a COX-independent manner.

Discussion

161

Given the concerns about NSAID use with COVID-19, we studied whether NSAIDs and

162

their inhibition of the COX-2/PGE2 pathway affects SARS-CoV-2 entry and replication. We found

163

that SARS-CoV-2 infection leads to PTGS2 upregulation in diverse systems, including Calu-3 and

164

A549 lung cancer cell lines, primary HBEC air-liquid interface cultures, and the lungs of human

165

ACE2-expressing mice. However, inhibition of COX-2/PGE2 signaling with the commonly used

166

NSAIDs ibuprofen and meloxicam did not affect ACE2 expression in multiple cell and tissue types

167

in vitro or in vivo, nor SARS-CoV-2 entry or replication. Our findings therefore rule out a direct

168

effect of NSAIDs on SARS-CoV-2 infection.

169

An important question arising from our findings is how SARS-CoV-2 infection induces

170

COX-2 expression. One possibility is that the pattern recognition receptor retinoic acid inducible

171

gene-I (RIG-I), which can recognize double-stranded RNA generated during viral genome

172

replication and transcription (32), may drive this response. Indeed, COX-2 induction by influenza

173

A virus is RIG-I-dependent (33), and we showed here that Huh7.5 cells, which are defective in

174

RIG-I signaling (34), do not upregulate PTGS2 in response to SARS-CoV-2. Alternatively, SARS-

175

CoV-2 proteins may mediate the induction of COX-2 through their complex effects on host cells.

176

In the case of SARS-CoV, transfection of plasmids encoding either the spike or the nucleocapsid

177

genes is sufficient to stimulate COX-2 expression (12, 13). SARS-CoV spike protein induces

178

COX-2 expression through both calcium-dependent PKCα/ERK/NF-κB and calcium-independent

179

PI3K/PKCε/JNK/CREB pathways (13), while the nucleocapsid protein directly binds to the COX-

180

2 promoter to regulate its expression (12). Any of these potential mechanisms are consistent with

181

our HBEC scRNA-seq results demonstrating that SARS-CoV-2 increases PTGS2 expression in

182

a cell-intrinsic manner.

183

Given our finding that COX-2 signaling does not regulate viral entry or replication, the role

184

of COX-2 induction upon SARS-CoV-2 infection remains an area for future investigation. Rather

185

than directly affecting viral entry or replication, COX-2 induction may regulate the severe lung

186

inflammation and injury seen in COVID-19 patients (35, 36), though it is unclear whether COX-2

187

would be beneficial, neutral, or detrimental to disease. COX-2 could enhance lung injury in

188

COVID-19, as PGE2 has been reported to induce IL-1β and exacerbate lung injury in bone marrow

189

transplant mice (37). Additionally, PGE2 stimulates fibroblast proliferation, which could underlie

190

the fibroproliferative response to acute lung injury that results in long-lasting respiratory

191

dysfunction (38). At the same time, PGE2 is critical for maintaining endothelial barrier integrity,

192

which is disrupted in acute lung injury (39), and COX-2 has also been found to promote resolution

193

of acute lung injury by enhancing lipoxin signaling (40). NSAID inhibition of COX-2 could therefore

194

have complex effects on the host response to SARS-CoV-2. However, it is reassuring that

195

retrospective studies thus far have not observed worse clinical outcomes in COVID-19 patients

196

taking NSAIDs (41–43).

197

In summary, we demonstrated that SARS-CoV-2 infection induces COX-2 expression in

198

diverse systems in vitro and in vivo. However, inhibition of COX-2 by NSAIDs did not affect viral

199

entry or replication, suggesting NSAIDs should not be contraindicated in COVID-19 patients.

Cell lines

252

Calu-3 and Huh7.5 were from ATCC. Calu-3 cells were cultured in Eagle's Minimum Essential

253

Medium (EMEM) with 10% heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum (FBS), 1% GlutaMAX (Gibco), and

254

1% Penicillin/Streptomycin. Huh7.5 cells were cultured in Dulbecco's Modified Eagle Medium

255

(DMEM) with 10% heat-inactivated FBS and 1% Penicillin/Streptomycin. All cell lines tested

Generation of SARS-CoV-2 stocks

259

As previously described (44), SARS-CoV-2 P1 stock was generated by inoculating Huh7.5 cells

260

with SARS-CoV-2 isolate USA-WA1/2020 (BEI Resources, NR-52281) at a MOI of 0.01 for three

261

days. The P1 stock was then used to inoculate Vero-E6 cells, and after three days, the

262

supernatant was harvested and clarified by centrifugation (450 × g for 5 min), filtered through a

263

0.45-micron filter, and stored in aliquots at -80°C. Virus titer was determined by plaque assay

264

using Vero-E6 cells (44).

265

To generate icSARS-CoV-2-mNG stocks (30), lyophilized icSARS-CoV-2-mNG was

266

reconstituted in 0.5 ml of deionized water. 50 µl of virus was diluted in 5 ml media and then added

267

to 107 Vero-E6 cells. Three days later, the supernatant was harvested and clarified by

268

centrifugation (450 × g for 5 min), filtered through a 0.45-micron filter, and stored in aliquots at -

269

80°C.

270

All work with SARS-CoV-2 or icSARS-CoV-2-mNG was performed in a biosafety level 3

271

facility with approval from the office of Environmental Health and Safety and the Institutional

272

Animal Care and Use Committee at Yale University.

Ibuprofen (I4883) and meloxicam (M3935) were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich. For cell culture

276

experiments, ibuprofen and meloxicam were solubilized in DMSO at a stock concentration of 10

277

mM and then diluted in media to make working solutions. For mouse experiments, stock solutions

278

of ibuprofen (300 mg/ml) and meloxicam (10 mg/ml) were prepared in DMSO and then diluted

279

100-fold in PBS to make working solutions. To determine the maximum non-toxic dose of NSAIDs

280

to use for cell culture experiments, cells were treated with different concentrations of ibuprofen or

281

Mice

285

C57BL/6J and K18-hACE2 [B6.Cg-Tg(K18-ACE2)2Prlmn/J (17)] were purchased from Jackson

286

Laboratory. K18-hACE2 mice were anesthetized using 30% vol/vol isoflurane diluted in propylene

287

glycol (30% isoflurane) and administered 1.2 × 106 PFU of SARS-CoV-2 intranasally. C57BL/6J

288

mice were anesthetized using 30% isoflurane and administered 30 mg/kg ibuprofen, 1 mg/kg

289

meloxicam, or an equivalent amount of DMSO intraperitoneally in a volume of 10 ml/kg daily for

290

4 days. Animal use and care was approved in agreement with the Yale Animal Resource Center

291

and Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee (#2018-20198) according to the standards set
