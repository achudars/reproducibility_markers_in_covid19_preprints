Abstract

34

Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is the cause of the

35

ongoing pandemic of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), a public health emergency of

36

international concern declared by the World Health Organization (WHO). An immuno-

37

informatics approach along with comparative genomic was applied to design a multi-epitope-

38

based peptide vaccine against SARS-CoV-2 combining the antigenic epitopes of the S, M and E

39

proteins.

40

bioinformatics tools. The candidate vaccine showed an average of ≥ 90.0% world population

41

coverage for different ethnic groups. Molecular docking of the chimeric vaccine peptide with the

42

immune receptors (TLR3 and TLR4) predicted efficient binding. Immune simulation predicted

43

significant primary immune response with increased IgM and secondary immune response with

44

high levels of both IgG1 and IgG2. It also increased the proliferation of T-helper cells and

45

cytotoxic T-cells along with the increased INF-γ and IL-2 cytokines. The codon optimization and

46

mRNA secondary structure prediction revealed the chimera is suitable for high-level expression

47

and cloning. Overall, the constructed recombinant chimeric vaccine candidate demonstrated

48

significant potential and can be considered for clinical validation to fight against this global

49

threat, COVID-19.

The tertiary structure was predicted, refined and validated using advanced

Introduction

59

Emergence of novel coronavirus, known as severe acute respiratory syndrome

60

coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), which was first reported in Wuhan, Hubei Province, China in

61

December 2019 is responsible for the ongoing global pandemic of coronavirus disease 2019

62

(COVID-19). The ongoing outbreak of COVID-19 has already made its alarmingly quick

63

transmission across the globe in 199 countries and regions with a total of 723,077 active

64

infection cases and 33,983 deaths until March 29, 20201. World Health Organization (WHO) has

65

declared a global health emergency, and scientists are racing over the clock to develop effective

66

interventions for controlling and preventing COVID-19 by analyzing novel SARS-CoV-2

67

genomics, functional structures, and its host-pathogen interactions. Efforts to contain the virus

68

are ongoing; however, given the many uncertainties regarding pathogen transmissibility and

69

virulence, the effectiveness of these efforts is unknown.

70

This SARS-CoV-2 is the third coronovairus (CoV) that can infect human after the two

71

previously reported coronavirus- severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS-CoV)2,3 and Middle

72

East respiratory syndrome (MERS-CoV)4-6. Alike SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, the recent

73

SARS-CoV-2 is a positive-sense single-stranded RNA virus (+ssRNA) belonging to Genus

74

Betacoronavirus within the family Coronaviridae7. The genome of SARS-CoV-2 is

75

approximately 30 kilobases (between 26,000 and 32,000 bases) in length8, and encodes for

76

multiple structural and non-structural proteins7. The four major structural proteins of CoVs are

77

the spike (S) glycoprotein, small envelope protein (E), membrane protein (M), and nucleocapsid

78

protein (N)7. Among these proteins, the S glycoprotein is composed of two main domains, the

79

receptor-binding domain (RBD) and N-terminal domain (NTD),9,10 which play essential role for

80

the attachment and entry of viral particles into the host cells11,12 and characterized by high

81

antigenicity and surface exposure2,11,13.

82

To combat the devastating effects of SARS-CoV-2, Scientists applied different vaccine

83

strategies globally. In addition, a curative approach using different drug candidates have been

84

tried so far to combat the current pandemic COVID-19. However, COVID-19 is marching too

85

fast and reached almost every territory in earth. Hence, apart from developing novel drugs

86

against this viral infection, a very potent vaccine candidate is very much desirable. Being an

87

RNA virus, the virus had undergone mutations several times already in the last 4 months14. As a

88

result, instead of single epitope, multi-epitope based vaccines can play a great role in fighting

89

against this novel CoV.

90

On coronaviruses, the component primarily targeted by monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) is

91

the trimeric S glycoprotein of the virion consisting of three homologous chains (A, B and C),

92

which mediate receptor recognition and membrane fusion during viral entry into sensitive cells

93

through the host angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) receptor5,9,11,13. However, with the

94

rapid evolution and high genomic variation of RNA viruses, mutations on the RBD may enable

95

the new strains to escape neutralization by currently known RBD-targeting antibodies.

96

Therefore, other functional regions of the S glycoprotein can be important for developing

97

effective prophylactic and therapeutic interventions against SARS-CoV-2 infection. Several

98

mAbs targeting non-RBD regions, especially the NTD has recently been reported13,15. The NTD

99

is located on the side of the spike trimer and has not been observed to undergo any dynamic

100

conformational changes11, and therefore, might play role in viral attachment, inducing

101

neutralizing antibody responses and stimulates a protective cellular immunity against SARS-

102

CoV2,6,11. Besides, administration of RBD and NTD proteins also induced highly potent

103

neutralizing antibodies and long-term protective immunity in animal models9. Furthermore, the E

104

and M proteins also have important functions in the viral assembly of a coronavirus and can

105

augment the immune response against SARS-CoV11,16,17. Monoclonal antibodies with potent

106

neutralizing activity have become promising candidates for both prophylactic and therapeutic

107

interventions against SARS-CoV-2 infections13. Therefore, the generation of antibodies targeting

108

the RBD and/or NTD of the S glycoprotein, M and E proteins of SARS-CoV-2 would be an

109

important preventive and treatment strategy that can be tested further in suitable models before

110

clinical trials18. The nucleocapsid (N) protein of SARS-coronavirus (SARS-CoV), buried inside

111

phospholipid bilayer, is the major protein in the helical nucleocapsid of virion. This protein is

112

reported to be more conserved than other structural proteins, an important B cell immunogen, as

113

well as, can elicit longlasting and persistent cellular immune responses. Nevertheless, we did

114

not consider this protein in the chimeric vaccine formation because of its initial unavailability

115

outside of the host cell during infection19.

116

Most previous studies of the CoVs have focused on the use of single recombinant

117

antigens, however, the immune responses generated have been inadequate to warrant their use in

118

the development of an effectual protective tool20,21. Alternatively, we propose the development

119

of a multi-epitope vaccine candidate which could lead to the generation of a more potent

120

protective immune response. Multi-epitope vaccine candidates have already been designed for

121

several diseases, including FMD (in our laboratory; unpublished data), MERS and SARS, and

122

their efficacies have been further reported in MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV2,6,22. Hence, we can

123

assume that chimeric vaccine targeting multiple epitopes on the RBD and NTD segments of the

124

S protein, M and E proteins would be a potentially effective vaccine candidate in combatting

125

SARS-CoV-2, and therefore, could be used for vaccine design. Combining subunit vaccines with

126

established or new adjuvants may represent a faster and safer strategy to move through early

127

clinical development and analyze the efficacy. This study was therefore aimed to in-silico design

128

and construction of a multi-epitope-based chimeric vaccine candidate against the globally

129

pandemic highly pathogenic SARS-CoV-2.

Results

132

Retrieving protein sequences

133

We retrieved the spike (S), envelop (E) and membrane (M) protein sequences of the

134

SARS-CoV-2, and the S protein sequences of the SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV from the whole

135

genome reference sequences of the respective three viruses from the NCBI database. To map the

136

structural variability of the S protein of SARS-CoV-2, SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, we applied

137

homology search on the respective S protein sequences, and finally selected three protein data

138

bank (PDB) templates such as 6vsb, 6acd and 5w9h, respectively for predicting the three

139

dimensional (3D) conformation of the S proteins. Finally, the 3D conformation of the S proteins

140

of the respective three viruses were validated using the Ramachandran plot analysis

141

(Supplementary Fig. 1).

142
143

Physicochemical properties and trimeric structure of spike (S) protein

144

The physiochemical properties of the spike (S) glycoproteins of the SARS-CoV-2,

145

SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV computed using the Protparam on the ExPASy server demonstrates

146

that it varies significantly among the three viruses. The theoretical isoelectric points (PI) of the

147

subject proteins were 6.24, 5.56 and 5.70, respectively. Protparam computed instability-index

148

(II) of the S protein of SARS-CoV-2, SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV were 33.01, 32.42 and 36.60

149

indicating that these proteins are quite stable4,23.

150

The S protein of the SARS-CoV-2, SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV is a trimeric

151

conformation consisting of three homologous chains naming as chain A, B and C5,10 (Fig. 1). The

152

individual structural domain of coronavirus S proteins reflects high degree of structural

153

divergences in the receptor-binding domain (RBD) and N-terminal domain (NTD) of the chain A

154

and chain C compared to that of chain B. Multiple sequence alignment revealed that the S

155

protein of SARS-CoV-2 shares 77.38% and 31.93% sequence identity with the S proteins of the

156

SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, respectively, and these findings are in line with many earlier

157

studies3-7 (Supplementary Fig. 2). Due to structural divergence in RBD and NTD of S proteins in

158

SARS-CoV-2, SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, these regions are the main focus of structural

159

studies including epitope-based chimeric vaccine candidate designing, selection, and

160

development.

161
162

Structure-based B-cell epitopes prediction

163

Linear epitopes prediction based on solvent-accessibility and flexibility revealed that

164

chain A of S protein possessed 15 epitopes, of which three epitopes having different residues

165

positions (395-514, 58-194, 1067-1146) were highly antigenic (score > 0.8). However, the B and

166

C chains had 18 and 19 epitopes, respectively, and of them three epitopes in chain B (residues

167

position 1067-1146, 89-194, 58-87) and two epitopes in chain C (residues position 56-194, 1067-

168

1146) seem to be highly antigenic (score > 0.8) (Table 1). The amino acid residues 395-514 and

169

56-194 of the detected epitopes belonged to RBD and NTD regions of the S protein,

170

respectively. These regions were considered as the potential epitope candidates in the IEDB

171

analysis resource Elipro analysis. However, the epitopes with amino-acids position of 1067-1146

172

were not selected as the potential epitope candidate because of their presence in viral

173

transmembrane domains (Supplementary Fig. 3). The tertiary structures of the RBD and NTD

174

illustrate their surface-exposed position on the S protein (Fig. 2).

175
176

Sequence-based B-cell epitopes

177

Antigenicity analysis of full-length S glycoprotein, M (membrane) and E (envelope)

178

proteins using VaxiJen v2.0 showed antigenicity scores of 0.465, 0.510 and 0.603, respectively

179

exhibiting them as potential antigens. Therefore, they were considered to be promising epitopes

180

for vaccine candidate selection against globally pandemic SARS-CoV-2 infections. A total of 22

181

B-cell epitopes were predicted in S protein of the SARS-CoV-2 using IEDB analysis resource

182

and Bepipred linear epitope prediction 2.0 tools. Of the detected epitopes, eight and six epitopes

183

were respectively found in RBD (aa position 328-528) and NTD (aa position 56-194) regions

184

while the E and M proteins had 2 and 6 epitopes, respectively (Fig. 3, Supplementary Table 1).

185

However, only 5 epitopes were exposed on the surface of the virion, and had a high antigenicity

186

score (> 0.4), indicating their potentials in initiating immune responses (Table 2). To find out the

187

most probable peptide-based epitopes with better confidence level, selected peptides were further

188

tested using VaxiJen 2.0 tool, and five peptides having antigenicity score of ≥ 0.5 were

189

annotated. Among the 5 annotated epitopes, RBD region had two highly antigenic epitopes (75-

190

IRGDEVRQIAPGQTGKIADYNYKLPD-100,

191

QSYGFQPTNGVGYQ-189, antigenicity score = 0.668). Similarly, the NTD region harbored

192

two highly antigenic epitopes (117-SQPFLMDLEGKQGNFKNLRE-136, antigenicity score =

193

0.749 and 17-GTNGTKRFDN-26, antigenicity score = 0.667). In addition, the envelop (E)

194

protein possessed only one highly antigenic epitope (57-YVYSRVKNLNSSRVP-71,

195

antigenicity score = 0.449) which might be potentially functional in host cell binding (Table 2).

196

Furthermore, the Kolaskar and Tongaonkar antigenicity profiling found five highly antigenic

197

epitopes in RBD region with an average (antigenicity) score of 1.042 (minimum = 0.907,

198

maximum = 1.214), and seven highly antigenic epitopes in NTD with an average (antigenicity)

199

score of 1.023 (minimum = 0.866, maximum = 1.213) (Supplementary Fig. 4, Supplementary

200

Table 2). The average Kolaskar scores for envelop protein B-cell epitope (EBE) and membrane

201

protein B-cell epitope (MBE) were 0.980 and 1.032, respectively (Supplementary Table 2).

202

However, through ABCPred analysis, we identified 18 and 11 B-cell epitopes in RBD and NTD

203

regions with average antigenicity score of 0.775 and 0.773 in the associated domains,

204

respectively (Supplementary Table 3).

205
206

Recognition of T-cell epitopes

207

The IEDB analysis resource tool was employed to identify T-cell epitopes in RBD and

208

NTD of the S protein of SARS-CoV-2. The prediction method included the major

209

histocompatibility complex class I and П (MHC-I, MHC-П), proteasomal cleavage and TAP

210

transport. The RBD and NTD regions were analyzed using IEDB MHC- I binding prediction tool

211

to predict T lymphocytes epitopes that have binding affinity with MHC-I alleles based on

212

Artificial Neural Network (ANN) with half-maximal inhibitory concentration (IC50) ≤ 50 nM. A

213

lower IC50 value indicates higher binding affinity of the epitopes with the MHC class I and II

214

molecules. While most of the studies24,25 reported that a binding affinity (IC50) threshold of 250

215

nM identifies peptide binders recognized by T-cells, and this threshold can be used to select

216

peptides, we kept binding affinity within 50 nM to get better confidence level in predicting

217

epitopes for MHC-I and MHC-II alleles. The IEDB MHC-I prediction tool retrieved 77 T-cell

218

epitopes in RBD that interacted with 21 possible MHC-I alleles whereas the NTD domain

219

possessed 35 T-cell epitopes with 17 possible MHC-I alleles (Supplementary Data 1). Similarly,

220

the IEDB MHC-II prediction tool generated 13-mer124 peptides from the RBD, and 10-mer 73

221

peptides in the NTD segments of the S protein that showed interaction with many different

222

and/or common MHC-II alleles with an IC50 value ranging from 1.4 to 49.9 nM (Supplementary

223

Data 1). Furthermore, for MHC-I and MHC-II processing, the analysis tool of the IEDB

224

generates an overall score for each epitope’s intrinsic potential of being a T-cell epitope based on

225

proteasomal processing, TAP transport, and MHC-binding efficiency (Supplementary Data 1).

226

The outcomes of these tools are quite substantial because they utilize vast number of alleles of

227

HLAs (human-leukocyte-antigens) during computation.

228
229

Molecular docking analysis of T-cell epitopes with HLA alleles

230

From the selected epitopes from the RBD and NTD segments, top five based on IC50

231

score were used in molecular docking analysis using the GalaxyWeb server with their respective

232

HLA allele binders, in which they revealed significantly favorable molecular interaction for

233

binding affinity. Docking complexes thus formed have significantly negative binding energy,

234

and most of the aa residues of the epitopes were involved in molecular interactions with their

235

respective HLA alleles (Supplementary data 1). The epitope-HLA docking complexes were

236

further refined with GalaxyRefineComplex, and their binding affinity was analyzed through

237

PRODIGY web-server. All of the selected epitopes showed significantly negative binding

238

affinity (ΔG always remained ≤ -8.2 kcal mol-1, average = -9.94 kcal mol-1, Fig. 4,

239

Supplementary data 1).

241

IFN-γ inducing epitope prediction

242

The findings of IFNepitope program suggests that, both the target RBD and NTD regions

243

of S protein, and B-cell linear epitope (MBE) had great probability to release of IFN-γ with a

244

positive score. A total of 56 potential positive IFN-γ inducing epitopes (15-mer) were predicted

245

for the RBD domain with an average epitope prediction score of 0.255 and the maximum SVM

246

score of 0.625. On the other hand, a total of 33 potential positive epitopes were predicted for the

247

NTD domain with an average epitope prediction score of 0.312 and the maximum SVM score of

248

0.811. Moreover, the M protein also possessed several IFN-γ inducing epitopes having an

249

average epitope prediction score of 0.980 (Supplementary Table 4).

250
251

Population coverage analysis

252

The distribution of HLA allele varies between different geographical regions and ethnic

253

groups around the globe. Therefore, population coverage during the development of an efficient

254

vaccine must be taken into account. In this study, epitopes having IC50 values ≤ 50 nM and their

255

respective alleles (CTL and HTL) were considered for population coverage analysis both

256

individually (MHC-I and MHC- II) and in combination (Supplementary Data 2). Our selected

257

CTL and HTL epitopes were found to cover 94.9% and 73.11% of the world population,

258

respectively. Importantly, CTL and HTL epitopes showed 98.63% population coverage

259

worldwide when used in combination. The highest population coverage was found to be 99.99%

260

in the Latin American country, Peru (Fig. 5, Supplementary Data 2). In China, where the viral

261

strain (SARS-CoV-2) first appeared and had more devastating outbreaks, the population

262

coverage for CTL and HTL epitopes was 92.67% and 53.44%, respectively with a combined

263

coverage of 96.59%. SARS-CoV-2 is currently causing serious pandemics in different continents

264

of the globe including Italy, England, Spain, Iran, South Korea and United States of America

265

where the combined population coverage was found to be 98.8%, 99.44%, 95.35%, 98.48%,

266

99.19% and 99.35%, respectively (Fig. 5a, Supplementary Data 2). In addition to geographical

267

distribution, the ethnic groups also found to be an important determinant for good coverage of

268

the CTL and HTL epitopes (Fig. 5b). Of the studied 147 ethnic groups, the Peru Amerindian had

highest population coverage for CTL (99.98%) while the HTL epitopes had highest population

270

coverage for Austria Caucasoid (88.44%) (Fig. 5b, Supplementary Data 2). Furthermore, 53.06%

271

of the ethnic groups had a combined population coverage of more than 90.0% for both CTL and

272

HTL epitopes.

Design and construction of chimeric vaccine candidate

275

The selected sequences for designing of chimeric construct were PADRE (13 aa), MBE

276

(20 aa), NTD (139 aa), RBD (200 aa), EBE (15 aa), and Invasin (16 aa), and the construct was

277

named as CoV-RMEN. The schematic diagram of protein domain structures, their junctions and

278

linker sites in CoV-RMEN are shown in Fig. 6a. These fragments were fused together using a

279

repeat of hydrophobic (glycine; G) and acidic aa (glutamic acid; E) linkers. The EGGE, GG, GG,

280

GG and EGGE sequences were introduced between different domains, and epitopes for more

281

flexibility and efficient separation with balancing of acidic and basic amino acids.

282
283

Prediction of the antigenicity and allergenicity of the CoV-RMEN

284

The antigenicity of the final chimeric protein sequence was predicted by the VaxiJen 2.0

285

server to be 0.450 with a virus model at a threshold of 0.4 and 0.875 with ANTIGENpro. The

286

results indicate that the generated CoV-RMEN sequences are both antigenic in nature. The

287

vaccine sequence without the adjuvant was also predicted to be non-allergenic on both the

288

AllerTOP v.2 and AllergenFP servers21.

289
290

Physiochemical properties and solubility prediction of the CoV-RMEN

291

The molecular weight (MW) of the finally constructed vaccine candidate was predicted to

292

be 46.8kDa with a theoretical isoelectric point value (pI) of 8.71. The protein is predicted to be

293

slightly basic in nature based on the pI. The half-life was assessed to be 4.4 hours in mammalian

294

reticulocytes in vitro, and >20hours in yeast and >10hours in E. coli in vivo. The protein was

295

predicted to be less soluble upon expression with a solubility score of 0.330 corroborating the

296

findings of many previous studies21,26. An instability index (II) of 29.74 was predicted,

297

classifying the protein as stable (II of > 40 indicates instability). The estimated aliphatic index

298

was predicted to be 66.59, indicating thermostability. The predicted Grand average of

299

hydropathicity (GRAVY) was −0.300. The negative value indicates the protein is hydrophilic in

300

nature and can interact with water molecules21.

301
302

Secondary and tertiary structures prediction of the CoV-RMEN

303

The CoV-RMEN peptide was predicted to contain 43.2% alpha helix, 67.4% beta sheet,

304

and 12% turns (Fig. 6b, Supplementary Fig. 5) using CFSSP:Chou and Fasman secondary

305

structure prediction server. In addition, with regards to solvent accessibility of aa residues, 34%

306

were predicted to be exposed, 30% medium exposed, and 34% were predicted to be buried. Only

307

2 aa residues (0.0%) were predicted to be located in disordered domains by the RaptorX Property

308

server (Supplementary Fig. 6). The Phyre2 server predicted the tertiary structure model of the

designed chimeric protein in 5 templates (c5x5bB, c2mm4A, c6vsbB, c5x29B and c6vybB)

310

based on heuristics to maximize confidence, percent identity and alignment coverage. The final

311

model of the CoV-RMEN peptide modelled at 82% with more than 90% confidence (Fig. 6c).

312

Moreover, 65 residues were modelled by ab initio.

313
314
315
316

Tertiary structure refinement and validation of the CoV-RMEN

317

After energy minimization of the CoV-RMEN using GROMOS96 program27, refinement

318

of the vaccine model on the ModRefiner server followed by further refinement on the

319

GalaxyRefine server yielded five models. The selected model has parameters scores of GDT-HA

320

(0.9538), RMSD (0.414), and MolProbity (2.035). The Ramachandran plot analysis of the finally

321

modelled protein revealed that 94.7% of residues in the protein are in favored regions (Fig. 6d),

322

consistent with the 94.0% score predicted by the GalaxyRefine analysis. Additionally, 4.8% of

323

the residues were predicted to be in allowed regions, and only 0.5% in disallowed region (Fig.

324

6d). The chosen model after refinement had an overall quality factor of 74.45% with ERRAT

325

(Supplementary Fig. 7) while ProSA-web gave a Z-score of −6.17 (Fig. 6e) for the CoV-RMEN

326

protein model.

Immune simulation

329

The immune-stimulatory ability of the predicted vaccine CoV-RMEN was conducted

330

through the C-ImmSimm server. The analysis predicts the generation of adaptive immunity in

331

target host species (human) using position-specific scoring matrix (PSSM), and machine learning

332

techniques for the prediction of epitopes and immune interactions28. The cumulative results of

333

immune responses after three times antigen exposure with four weeks interval each time revealed

334

that the primary immune response against the antigenic fragments was elevated indicated by

335

gradual increase of IgM level after each antigen exposure (Fig. 7a). Besides, the secondary

336

immune response, crucial for immune stability, have been shown as increased with adequate

337

generation of both IgG1 and IgG2. Also, the elevated level of all circulating immunoglobulins

338

indicates the accuracy of relevant clonal proliferation of B-cell and T-cell population. The level

339

of cytokines after antigen exposure increased concomitantly reflected by escalation of IFN-γ and

340

IL-2 which are most significant cytokines for anti-viral immune response and clonal selection

341

(Fig. 7b). The abundance of different types of B-cells and T-cells, like antigen processing B-

342

cells, resting memory B- and T- cells, B-cells with IgM and IgG remains significantly higher

343

indicating development of immune memory and consequently increased clearance of antigen

344

after exposure (Fig. 7c,d). Additionally, T-helper cells and cytotoxic T-cells were found with a

345

drastic up-regulation of Th1 concentration enhancing the B-cell proliferation and immune

346

memory development (Fig. 7e,f). The high level of immunoglobulin IgG1 + IgG2, active B-cell

347

and T-helper cell population reflected the development of strong immune response reinforcing

348

the indelible and peerless antigenicity of the CoV-RMEN vaccine candidate.

350

Molecular docking of CoV-RMEN with immune receptors (TLR3 and TLR4)

351

The ClusPro server was used to determine the protein binding and hydrophobic

352

interaction sites on the protein surface. The immune responses of TLR3 and TLR4 against

353

vaccine construct (CoV-RMEN) were estimated by analyzing the overall conformational stability

354

of vaccine protein-TLRs docked complexes. The active interface aa residues of refined

355

complexes of CoV-RMEN and TLRs were predicted (Fig. 8, Table 3). The relative binding free

356

energies (ΔG) of the protein-TLRs complexes were significantly negative (Table 3) which

357

suggest that the interaction of the chimeric protein might favor stimulation of the TLR receptors.

358

Interface contacts (IC) per property (ICs charged-charged: 16, ICs charged-polar: 22, ICs

359

charged-apolar: 26, polar-polar: 6, ICs polar-apolar: 25 and apolar-apolar: 29) were for the

360

vaccine protein-TLR3 complex. Also, vaccine protein-TLR4 complex showed similar (ICs) per

361

property (ICs charged-charged: 5, ICs charged-polar: 11, ICs charged-apolar: 30, polar-polar: 4,

362

ICs polar-apolar: 31 and apolar-apolar: 39). These data validate the selected docked complexes

363

that may result high binding among TLRs and the chimeric protein (Fig. 8).

364
365

Codon optimization of the CoV-RMEN

366

The high yield expression of a recombinant protein is always remained as a challenge,

367

whereas heterologous prokaryotic expression vector can potentiate a robust, low cost and user-

368

friendly technology for large scale vaccine production. For this reason, the recombinant protein

369

encoding sequence need to be optimized for escalation of protein expression and downstream

370

processing for a final product development. In order to optimize codon usage of the vaccine

371

construct CoV-RMEN in E. coli (strain K12) for maximal protein expression, Rare Codon

372

Analysis Tool (GenScript) was used. The length of the optimized codon sequence was 1,251

373

nucleotides. The Codon Adaptation Index (CAI) of the optimized nucleotide sequence was 0.87,

374

and the average GC content of the adapted sequence was 50.26% showing the possibility of good

375

expression of the vaccine candidate in the E. coli host. The optimal percentage range of GC

376

content is between 30% and 70% (Fig. 9 a,b,c).

Prediction of mRNA secondary structure of the CoV-RMEN

379

The evaluation of minimum free energy for 25 structures of chimeric mRNA, the

380

optimized sequences carried out by the ‘Mfold’server. The results showed that ΔG of the best

381

predicted structure for the optimized construct was ΔG = -386.50 kcal/mol. The first nucleotides

382

at 5' did not have a long stable hairpin or pseudoknot. Therefore, the binding of ribosomes to the

383

translation initiation site, and the following translation process can be readily accomplished in

384

the target host. These outcomes were in the agreement with data obtained from the

385

‘RNAfold’web server (Fig. 9 d,e) where the free energy was -391.37 kcal/mol.

386
387

Expression of CoV-RMEN with SUMO-fusion

388

After codon optimization and mRNA secondary structure analysis, the sequence of the

389

recombinant plasmid was designed by inserting the adapted codon sequences into pETite vector

390

(Lucigen, USA) using SnapGene software (Fig. 10). The utilization of pETite vector containing

391

SUMO (Small Ubiquitin-like Modifier) tag and 6x-His tag will facilitate both the solubilization

392

and affinity purification of the recombinant protein29. After successful cloning of the gene, the

393

recombinant plasmid can be propagated efficiently using E. coli cells, and subsequent protein

394

expression can be performed in E. coli K-12 strain using IPTG (Isopropyl β-d-1-

395

thiogalactopyranoside) induction and cultivation at 28 °C as also reported earlier29.

Discussion

399

The causative agent of the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic caused by SARS-CoV-2, the

400

seventh coronavirus with high zoonotic importance and transmission rate, has proved to be

401

transmitted through direct and indirect contact along with airborne transmission which contribute

402

very potentially for community transmission30-32. Since the emergence of SARS-CoV-2 in 2019

403

in Wuhan, China31,32, it has exceeded both SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV in its rate of

404

transmission among humans30, and therefore, effective measures counteracting its infection have

405

become a major research focus. Scientific efforts have been going on extensively to learn about

406

the virus, its biological properties, epidemiology, and pathophysiology7. At this early stage,

407

different vaccine development efforts have been going on globally along with the novel drug

408

development strategies33.

409

Development of an effective live attenuated vaccine for viral pathogens has been the

410

most practiced strategy for prevention. But due to its extremely high contagious nature and

411

ability for community transmission, this novel SARS-CoV-2 attenuated vaccine research

412

essentially requires high biosafety level for researchers and work stations, which may eventually

413

make it difficult to avail the vaccine for mass population of all the countries. Although live

414

attenuated vaccine is often very immunogenic, however, the risk of reversion to a virulent virus

415

has limited its usage as SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV vaccine22. Unlike other types of vaccines,

416

chimeric peptide vaccine production does not involve virus replication, therefore reduce the cost

417

of production. Hence, a low cost strategy should be adopted for developing a highly demanded

418

vaccine for the mankind. Heterologous expression of any vaccine candidate protein has very

419

promising scopes for developing such low cost vaccine, providing that all essential properties for

420

antigenicity, immunogenicity and functional configuration are being conserved to mimic the

421

structural and functional property of the actual antigen34. Construction of a vaccine candidate

422

with multiple potential epitopes can obviously potentiate the multi-valency of the antigen to

423

develop immune response against a number of epitopes of any pathogen. Also, rational

424

engineering of epitopes for increased potency and magnitude, ability to enhance immune

425

response in conserved epitopes, increased safety and absence of unnecessary viral materials and

426

cost effectiveness all these cumulatively include potential benefit to multi-epitope recombinant

427

protein based vaccine20. This study was designed to assist with the initial phase of multi-epitope

428

vaccine candidate selection. Thereby, safe and effective vaccine development by providing

429

recommendations of epitopes that may potentially be considered for incorporation in vaccine

430

design for SARS-CoV-2.

431

Pathophysiology and virulence mechanisms of coronaviruses (CoVs), and therefore

432

similarly of SARS-CoV-2 have links to the function of the structural proteins such as spike (S)

433

glycoprotein, envelop (E), and membrane (M) proteins34,35. Across the CoV families, the

434

antibodies against the S glycoprotein, M and E proteins of SARS-CoV-2 would provide

435

immunity to the infection2,12,22. Therefore, this work focused on the in silico design and

436

development of a potential multi-epitope vaccine for SARS-CoV-2 selecting epitopes and

437

domains from the S, E and M proteins.

438

Among the structural elements of CoVs, the spike S glycoproteins are composed of two

439

major domains, the RBD and NTD. Furthermore, the homotrimeric S proteins of the SARS-

440

CoV-2, SARS-CoV9,10 and MERS-CoV5 comprises three chains: the chain A, B and C on the

441

viral surface, guiding the link to host receptors. Unlike the full-length S protein of the CoVs, the

442

RBD and NTD segments possessed the critical neutralizing domains but lacking the non-

443

neutralizing immunodominant region6,10,11,22. Therefore, considering the safety and effectiveness

444

perspectives, the RBD and NTD are more promising candidates in the development of SARS-

445

CoV-2 vaccines over the full-length S protein. The presence of E and M proteins on the envelope

446

can augment the immune response against SARS-CoV2,36 and thus, considered for suitable

447

candidate for vaccine development7,12,22. Therefore, antibodies against the S, M and E proteins

448

of SARS-CoV-2 would provide protective immunity to the infection6,7,11,12,22.

449

Immuno-informatics analyses of the selected RBD and NTD regions indicated that these

450

contain ample amount of high-affinity B-cell, MHC Class I, MHC Class II and interferon-γ

451

(IFN-γ) epitopes with high antigenicity scores. Moreover, membrane B-cell epitope (MBE) and

452

envelop B-cell epitope (EBE) were selected from the M and E proteins, respectively for the final

453

vaccine construct to enhance the overall stability, immunogenicity and antigenicity of the

454

chimeric vaccine candidate, the CoV-RMEN21. The HLA alleles maintain the response to T-cell

455

epitopes, and in different ethnic communities and geographical regions, these alleles are highly

456

polymorphic. T-cell epitopes from RBD and NTD regions having high interaction with more

457

HLA alleles were found to cover more than 98% of the world population with different ethnic

458

groups6,37,38. Moreover, the molecular docking between T-cell epitopes and their respective HLA

459

alleles revealed their highly significant binding affinity reflecting the immune activation of B-

460

and T-cells23.

461

Vaccine design is improved through the use of specialized spacer sequences39. To

462

designing the CoV-RMEN (vaccine candidate) GG and EGGE linkers were incorporated

463

between

464

immunogenicity, thereby, allowing the rational design construction of a potent multi-epitope

465

vaccine21,38. The molecular weight of our vaccine candidate, the CoV-RMEN is 46.8 kDa with a

466

predicted theoretical pI of 8.71, indicating that the protein is basic in nature. Also, the predicted

467

instability index indicates that the protein will be stable upon expression, thus further

468

strengthening its potential for use. The aliphatic index showed that the protein contains aliphatic

469

side chains, indicating potential hydrophobicity. All these parameters indicate that the

470

recombinant protein is thermally stable, hence would be best suited for use in different endemic

471

areas worldwide6,21.

472

The knowledge of secondary and tertiary structures of the target protein is essential in

473

vaccine design39,40. Secondary structure analysis of the CoV-RMEN indicated that the protein

474

consisted of 43.2% alpha helix, 67.4% beta sheet, and 12% turns with only 2 residues disordered.

475

Natively unfolded protein regions and alpha-helical and beta sheet peptides have been reported

476

to be important forms of structural antigens21,40. These two structural forms (secondary and

477

tertiary), when tested as the synthetic peptides, have the ability to fold into their native

478

structure,hence, could be recognized by naturally induced antibodies in response to infection2.

479

The tertiary (3D) structure of the vaccine candidate improved markedly after the refinement, and

480

showed desirable properties based on Ramachandran plot predictions. The Ramachandran plot

481

shows that most of the residues are found in the favoured and allowed regions (94.7%) with very

482

few residues in the outlier region; this indicates that the quality of the overall model is

483

satisfactory21,23. The lack of allergenic properties of the CoV-RMEN further strengthens its

484

potential as a vaccine candidate. Strikingly, the multi-epitope peptide we designed and

485

constructed (CoV-RMEN), showed higher antigenicity scores on Vaxijen v2.0 (0.450 with a

486

virus model at a threshold of 0.4) and ANTIGENpro (0.875) gave an antigenic score almost

487

twice that of Ov-103 on ANTIGENpro (0.93 for the chimeric peptide and 0.59 for Ov-103)

488

supporting that this multiple-epitopes carrying vaccine candidate would be poorly immunogenic

489

and require coupling to adjuvants. However, the designed protein must show similar antigenicity

490

scores with and without the addition of an adjuvant sequence21.

491

It has been reported that immunity to viral infections is dependent on both B- and T-

492

cells20,21. Toll-Like Receptors (TLRs) recognize Pathogen Associated Molecular Patterns

493

(PAMPs) from viral components or replication intermediates, resulting in signaling cascades that

494

initiate an antiviral state in cells as a result of infection41. However, it is likely that TLRs might

495

play an important role in the innate immune response to SARS-CoV-2 infection42. Though, we

496

did not use any adjuvants, it is reported that TLRs (TLR3 and TLR4) can effectively bind with

497

spike protein of the CoV43. The molecular docking analysis of the CoV-RMEN through

498

HADDOCK showed that the chimeric protein can establish stable protein-protein interactions

499

with TLRs (TLR-3,TLR-4)41 indicating efficient activation of these surface molecules which is

500

very crucial for immune activation of dendritic cells for subsequent antigen processing and

501

presentation to CD4+ and CD8+ T-cells via MHC-II and MHC-1, respectively corroborating the

502

findings of different earlier studies11,20,21. TLR4 might bind to S protein leading to the

503

activation

504

proinflammatory cytokines35. Immune simulation of the designed CoV-RMEN showed results

505

consistent with typical immune responses, and there was a general increase in the generated

506

immune responses after repeated antigen exposures. The comprehensive immune response

507

developed after repeated antigen exposure reflected a perfect host defence development with the

508

uplifted primary immune response and subsequent secondary immune response resulting in

509

immune memory development2. In the present study, the development of memory B-cells and T-

510

cells was evident, with memory in B-cells lasting for several months. Helper T- cells were

511

particularly stimulated. The engrossing findings of the study is the development of Th1 response

512

which enhance the growth and proliferation of B- cells augmenting the adaptive immunity44. The

513

antiviral cytokine IFN-γ and cell stimulatory IL-2 level significantly increased which also

514

contribute to the subsequent immune response after vaccination in host2. This indicates high

515

levels of helper T-cells and consequently efficient antibody production, supporting a humoral

of the MyD88dependent

signaling pathway,

which ultimately releases

516

response21,45. The Simpson index, D for investigation of clonal specificity suggests a possible

517

diverse immune response. This is plausible considering the generated chimeric peptide is

518

composed of sufficient B- and T-cell epitopes.

519

One of the first steps in validating a candidate vaccine is to screen for immunoreactivity

520

through serological analysis. This requires the expression of the recombinant protein in a suitable

521

host. Escherichia coli expression systems are the preferred choice for the production of

522

recombinant proteins33. In order to achieve high-level expression of our recombinant vaccine

523

protein in E. coli (strain K12), codon optimization was carried out. Stable mRNA structure,

524

codon adaptability index (0.87), and the GC content (50.26%) were favourable for high-level

525

expression of the protein in bacteria. The next step projected at the moment, is to express this

526

peptide in a bacterial system and perform the various immunological assays needed to validate

527

the results obtained here through immuno-informatics analyses.

we named as CoV-RMEN possess domains of RBD and NTD segments of S, M and E proteins

533

all of which showed significant antigenic properties compared to any other viral proteins. This

534

chimera also includes potential CTL, HTL and B-cell epitopes to ensure humoral as well as

535

cellular immune response and the optimal expression and stability of the chimera was validated.

With multiple limitations and high cost requirements for the attenuated vaccine preparation for

Sequence retrieval and structure generation

545

A total of 250 partial and complete genome sequences of SARS-CoV-2 were retrieved

546

from NCBI (Supplementary Table 5). We aligned these sequences through MAFFT online

Despite having minor heterogeneity in spike glycoprotein (S), membrane (M) and envelop (E)

552

proteins, the NCBI reference genome (Accession no: NC_045512.2) of SARS-CoV-2 from

553

Wuhan, China was finally selected for domains and epitopes selection, secondary and tertiary

molecular docking, cDNA and mRNA analysis for cloning and expression20,21. Moreover, two

556

reference genome sequences of SARS-CoV (NC_004718.3) and MERS-CoV (NC_019843.3)

557

were also retrieved from the NCBI database to reveal the structural heterogeneity of S protein.

558

Multiple sequence alignment of the S proteins of the viruses was performed by CLUSTALW45.

559

Since the S glycoprotein of coronaviruses is important for viral attachment to host cell, antibody

evaluated using a PROCHECK (version 3.5)-server to check the stereochemical properties of the

566

Linear B-cell epitopes prediction

573

We employed both structure and sequence-based methods for B-cell epitopes prediction.

574

Conformational B-cell epitopes on the S protein were predicted by Ellipro (Antibody Epitope

575

Prediction tool; http://tools.iedb.org/ellipro/) available in IEDB analysis resource51 with the

576

minimum score value set at 0.4 while the maximum distance selected as 6 Å. The ElliPro allows

577

the prediction and visualization of B-cell epitopes in a given protein sequence or structure. The

578

ElliPro method is based on the location of the residue in the protein’s three-dimensional (3D)

579

structure. ElliPro implements three algorithms to approximate the protein shape as an ellipsoid,

580

calculate the residue protrusion index (PI), and cluster neighboring residues based on their

581

protrusion index (PI) value. The residues lying outside of the ellipsoid covering 90% of the inner

582

core residues of the protein score highest PI of 0.923. Antigenicity of full-length S (spike

“BepiPred Linear Epitope Prediction” (propensity scale method such as hidden Markov model)53

587

and ABCPred under default parameters54. To find out the most probable peptide-based epitopes

588

with better confidence level, selected peptides were further tested using VaxiJen antigenicity

Population coverage by CTL and HTL epitopes

612

Due to the MHC restriction of T-cell response, the peptides with more different HLA

613

binding specificities mean more population coverage in defined geographical regions and ethnic

614

groups where-and-to-whom the peptide-based vaccine might be employed. The predicted T-cell

615

epitopes were shortlisted based on the aligned Artificial Neural Network (ANN) with half-

616

maximal inhibitory concentration (annIC50) values up to 50 nM. The IEDB “Population

617

Coverage” tool (http://tools.iedb.org/population/)57 was used to determine the world human

618

population coverage by the shortlisted CTL and HTL epitopes. We used multi-epitopes involving

619

both CTL and HTL epitopes to have the higher probability of larger human population coverage

699

The generation of an appropriate immune response is dependent on the interaction

700

between an antigenic molecule and a specific immune receptor like Toll Like Receptors

701

(TLRs)33. Molecular docking of the CoV-RMEN with the TLR3 (PDB ID: 1ZIW) and TLR4

702

(PDB ID: 4G8A) receptor was performed using the High Ambiguity Driven DOCKing

703

(HADDOCK, version 2.4)65 web-server in order to evaluate the interaction between ligand and

704

receptor and consequently the development of an immune response. In order to predict such

705

interaction, data-driven docking of designed chimeric protein and TLR3 and TLR4 complexes

706

were performed33. In this regard, CPORT (https://milou.science.uu.nl/services/CPORT/) was

707

used to predict active interface residues of the CoV-RMEN and TLRs. The HADDOCK server

708

was then employed to perform docking simulations of the CoV-RMEN-TLRs complexes due to

709

perform short MD simulations of docked complexes56. Finally, the binding affinities of the top-

710

ranking docking pose of chimeric protein-TLRs complexes was predicted using the PRODIGY

711

(PROtein binDIng enerGY prediction) (https://nestor.science.uu.nl/prodigy/) web-server56.

Analysis of cDNA and mRNA for cloning and expression

Reverse translation and codon optimization were performed using the GenScript Rare

Codon Analysis Tool (https://www.genscript.com/tools/rare-codon-analysis) in order to express

716

the CoV-RMEN in a selected expression vector. Codon optimization was performed in order to

express the final vaccine construct in the E. coli (strain K12). The analysis output includes the

718

codon adaptation index (CAI) and percentage GC content, which can be used to assess protein

719

expression levels. CAI provides information on codon usage biases; the ideal CAI score is 1.0

720

but >0.8 is considered a good score66. The GC content of a sequence should range between 30–

70%. GC content values outside this range suggest unfavorable effects on translational and

Dear Editor,
I am pleased to submit an original research article entitled “Epitope-based chimeric peptide
vaccine design against S, M and E proteins of SARS-CoV-2 etiologic agent of global
pandemic COVID-19: an in silico approach” for your kind consideration for publication in the
npj Vaccines, a renowned Nature publishing journal. Severe acute respiratory syndrome
coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is the cause of the ongoing pandemic of coronavirus disease 2019
(COVID-19), a public health emergency of international concern declared by the World Health
Organization (WHO). An immuno-informatics approach along with comparative genomic was
applied to design a multi-epitope-based peptide vaccine against SARS-CoV-2 combining the
antigenic epitopes of the S, M and E proteins.
