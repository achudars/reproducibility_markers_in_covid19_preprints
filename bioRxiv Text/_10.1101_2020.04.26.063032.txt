Abstract: The coronavirus and the influenza virus have similarities and differences. In order to
comprehensively compare them, their genome sequencing data were examined by principal
component analysis. Variations in coronavirus were smaller than those in a subclass of the
10

influenza virus. In addition, differences among coronaviruses in a variety of hosts were small.
These characteristics may have facilitated the infection of different hosts. Although many of the
coronaviruses were more conservative, those repeatedly found among humans showed annual
changes. If SARS-CoV-2 changes its genome like the Influenza H type, it will repeatedly spread
every few years. In addition, the coronavirus family has many other candidates for subsequent

15

pandemics.

Short titles: Coronavirus, as a source of pandemics.

Introduction: COVID-19 (1, 2) is rapidly spreading worldwide. To investigate its spreading
mechanism, genomes of the coronavirus were compared to those of the influenza virus (3) by
5

principal component analysis (PCA) (4). These two RNA viruses differed in host specificity and
speed of mutations. Here, I present the characteristics of both and the changes in coronavirus.
The coronaviruses presented smaller variations and did not differ much from host to host. These
characteristics may have eased the novel transfection of coronaviruses to humans; many of the
bat strains seem to have the ability to infect humans, and the intermediate animals may not be

10

necessarily required, against the present expectations. Although many of the coronaviruses were
more conservative, their character may reflect a less selective pressure owing to their limited
infectivity. Rather, those repeatedly found among humans showed annual changes. If SARSCoV-2, which is highly infectious, changes its genome like the influenza H type, it will
repeatedly spread every few years. In addition, the coronavirus family may have other candidates

15

for subsequent outbreaks.
While the coronavirus genome is a positive-sense single-stranded 30 kb RNA, the influenza
genome is divided in eight segments. Both directly replicate using their RNA-dependent RNA
polymerases, which may cause many errors (5). This characteristic has introduced variations
among coronaviruses, including the number and size of their open reading frames (ORFs).

20

Some classes of coronaviruses, such as HCoV, cause upper respiratory tract infections in
humans. The symptoms are mostly similar to those of the common cold, but they may also cause
severe pneumonia (6). They have lower infectivity than the human influenza viruses. For
example, a 2010-2015 study in China reported that 2.3% and 30% of patients were positive for
coronavirus and influenza virus, respectively (6); a similar ratio was found in another large study

25

(6). Some viruses may have a much higher infectivity and cause outbreaks: e.g., SARS-CoV (7,
8), MERS-CoV (7, 9, 10), and SARS-CoV-2 (SCoV2) (2, 11-13). The former two cause severe
symptoms, while the latter varies from asymptomatic to critical.
The corona and influenza viruses have similarities and differences in infectivity, spread ability,
and symptoms. These differences are based on their genomes, which are important for estimating

30

how SCoV2 will act in humans.

Materials and Methods
Data and classification
Sequencing data were obtained from DDBJ database. Aligned data, obtained with
DECIPHER(14) (presented in the Supplementary material), were further processed to observe
5

the relationships among samples by using the direct PCA method (4), which can handle data with
limited assumptions. The conceptual diagram of the PCA is as follows (all calculations were
performed in R) (15). Updated versions of the scripts are presented in GitHub
(https://github.com/TomokazuKonishi/direct-PCA-for-sequences). To escape the imbalance
effect among samples, the decomposition was performed by removing clusters of similar

10

samples, e.g. those caused by SARS, MERS, or SCoV2. Instead, only one sample was included
from each cluster.
To prepare a comprehensive data set for SCoV2, 2,796 of full-length data were obtained
from GISAID database and added to those used for Fig. 1. Some of those records were rather
preliminary and contained several uncertain bases designated by ‚ÄúN‚Äù, which may be counted as

15

indels. To cancel such artifacts, the corresponding regions were replaced with the average data in
the PCA.

Estimation of the magnitude of the sample variations
The scale among sample sequences was estimated by mean distances, scaled by the length
of sequence m, of virus types. This was a type of standard deviation, ùëëÃÖ = ‚àö‚àë(ùë• ‚àí ùë•ÃÖ )2 ‚ÅÑ2ùëõùëö,

where x, ùë•ÃÖ , and n are the Boolean of each sample sequence, the mean sample, and the number
of samples, respectively. Coefficient 2 was used to correct the double counts of the differences.

The unit of length is the same as that of the PCA, which will extract the length toward particular
directions.
Estimation of mutation levels in the genome
5

The levels of PCs 1-5 for bases were estimated by the root sum square at each base position
(Fig. 2 and S3). If alterations existed in several samples, and if they occur coincidently, they may
contribute to a higher level of PC. To see the tendencies at the positions, two moving averages
with a width of 200 amino acid residues were shown for substitutions (grey) and indels (blue).

10

Results
The coronaviruses consist of distinct classes (Fig. 1). In the lower PC axes, the other classes
were separated (Fig. S1a and b), and these were further divided into subclasses. For example,
SARS-CoV and SCoV2 belong to different subclasses of Sarbecovirus (Fig. S1c and Table S1).
The origin of the graph, (0, 0) coincides with the mean data. The accumulation of mutations will

15

form a variety of viruses, which have different directions and distances from an original virus. If
the mutations and samplings are random, the original virus would be near to the data mean.
The variation magnitude, estimated by the mean distance ùëëÃÖ , was 0.11. This is much smaller than
those of single subclasses of influenza A virus (Fig. S2), such as H1 or H9. Incidentally, the
value of ùëëÃÖ was not significantly altered by artificial reductions of sample numbers or sequence

20

length (not shown).
Among the classes, Gammacoronavirus and Deltacoronavirus, which are close to the origin of
the graph, were found mainly in bird samples (Fig. 1 and Table S1). These could be the origin of
coronaviruses, as like the influenza viruses are thought to have originated from those of
waterfowls. The mean of the studied samples was located in the bat virus Norbecovirus, which

25

seems to be the origin of the viruses in mammals. Indeed, many classes apart from this class
were found in bat samples. The most distant classes from the mean, TGEV and Embecovirus,
were found in larger animals, but not in bats.
Human coronaviruses (HCoV) belong to Embecovirus, Alphacoronavirus, and Dubinacovirus
(Fig. 1, blue). Two classes without such common cold viruses, Merbecovirus and Sarbecovirus,

30

originated in recent outbreaks.

Similarly to other RNA viruses (5), many indels were observed, especially in some smaller ORFs
(Fig. 2 and S3). These range from small regions without frameshifts to large ones that alter plural
ORFs, e.g. Embecovirus is unique because it possesses an ORF of hemagglutinin. The class is
further distinguished by having another ORF, NS2a, or not (Figs 1 and 2). Even within a small
5

group of HCoV, OC43, an indel of 14 aa length existed in the spike protein. The classification
was not significantly affected by either focusing on the indels or on the rest (Fig. S4). Therefore,
indels were not given extra weight in this study; they were treated as a base or a residue. Note
that some other small ORFs, such as the envelope and nucleocapsid, are conservative.
The values of PC were not significantly affected by the hosts (Fig. 1) e.g. differences between

10

bird and swine viruses in Deltacoronaviruses were small (Table S1, PC18). This is contrarily to
influenza viruses, which were separated among different hosts; the class for waterfowl is located
near the centre, with three swine groups located around it, and two human groups were
positioned in the most apart (Fig. S2a) (3). In coronaviruses, those apart from the Norbecovirus
seem to infect larger animals, but this rule is not absolute (Table S1).

15

Each of the human-outbreak strains had similar ones in bats or camels, with minor differences
(Fig. 1 and Table S1). In the SARS spike protein, no amino acid residue was unique to humans.
This is partially because our knowledge about the viruses has increased after the efforts to screen
likely viruses in wild animals (1, 16-18). Only 35 out of 2412 residues were different from SARS
and similar bat viruses, and many of these were not conserved among the bat samples (Table S2).

20

The situation was the same in SCoV2 which presented 34 unique amino acid residues (Table
S2); however, this uniqueness could disappear after further research.
Influenza A H1N1 and HCoV yearly occurrence is very different, since only one H1N1 variety
spreads worldwide yearly (3). Contrarily, several OC43 variants appear even within a single
country (Fig. 3a, S5, and Table S3). H1 variants will never return in the subsequent seasons,

25

whereas OC43 varieties appeared repeatedly for a decade. However, by concentrating solely on
one variety, the annual alterations became obvious (Fig. 3b).
A comprehensive set of SCoV2 samples was separated into three directions, forming some
classes (Fig. 3c, S6a). Such classes could be made if a few persons with mutated virus migrated
to another place and the virus started to infect people. Plural classes were found in some

30

countries, suggesting multiple influx routes. The class closest to the data mean was that of China.

Samples reported from the countries far from China tend to show larger magnitudes of PCs, and
vice versa (Table S4).
Shift-type alterations were observed in coronaviruses, even though the genome is not separated.
This is contrastive to the cases of influenza, which can replace RNA molecules between viruses.
5

By focusing on the spike protein, coronaviruses were separated (Fig. 4a) similarly to the
classification obtained by the whole genome (Fig. 1). However, in the classification obtained by
1ab polyprotein, the positions of Deltacoronavirus and Embecobirus were exchanged (Fig. 4b).
Additionally, the position of the nucleocapsid protein in SARS-CoV moved from OC43, losing
the Emvecovirus unity (Fig. 4c). These drastic changes are difficult to explain without shifts.

10

Discussion
Coronavirus and influenza classes were fairly different in the following two aspects: although the
groups were clearly separated, the differences did not match those of the hosts in coronavirus;
and the divergence magnitude among coronaviruses was much lower than that of a subclass of
15

the influenza A virus. These characteristics corroborate the assessment that ‚Äúcoronaviruses can
apparently breach cell type, tissue, and host species barriers with relative ease‚Äù (19). Coronavirus
spike protein infection would be more tolerant to differences in hosts than the influenza virus'
hemagglutinin protein, which may have eased the selective pressure to separate the groups
according to the various hosts.

20

Shifts, which are not possible by replacing virus segments, may have occurred in coronavirus.
Since it does not copy the genome into double-stranded DNA, RNA splicing in nucleus (20) or
RNA interference would be used instead of the ordinal homologous recombination by the RecA
family (21). Those may also be the cause of frequent indels.
Viruses change their genome according to various selective pressures (5), such as to: a) Maintain

25

the functions: any changes can cause malfunctions, hence they have to conserve the genomes,
which is required for any state of the virus. b) Escape the herd immunity: Influenza A viruses,
which are highly infectious, escape herd immunity by continuously changing. All ORFs change
at the same speed (3), as any part of the virus that could be represented by the major
histocompatibility complex will become a target of the immune system. Contrarily, HCoV is not

30

very infectious; hence, some people remain unimmunized, easing this pressure. Also, the
resulting smaller number of replications per year would slow the speed rate of changes. This

might be the case for MERS-CoV among camels also (9, 22, 23). c) Exploit new hosts: this may
require a change in the docking system. Adaptation to the genetic system of a new host may alter
codon usage and several amino acids. SARS-CoV and SCoV2 might be under this type of
pressure during infection. d) Increase asymptotic patients: patients with mild or no symptoms are
5

required. In humans, once all infected individuals are identified, the virus is contained, especially
if the symptoms are critical.
The conditions required to cause a pandemic are obvious in cases of influenza viruses. First, it
has to be highly infective such as type H1N1. Second, it should be free from herd immunity. For
example, the Pdm09 belongs to one of the two subclasses that did not cause outbreaks among

10

humans (3). The SARS- and MERS-CoV fulfil these conditions, but they failed to escape the
selective pressure mentioned above (d). SCoV2 satisfies all these conditions, thus spreading
worldwide as Pdm09 did.
The dominated R type H1 of influenza A changed annually during its outbreak periods (3); by
changing its most variable residues during three decades, and Pdm09 also changed annually.

15

Coronaviruses have shown few annual changes (Fig. 3b and S6a), which might be due to their
limited infectibility (HCoV) or to the lack of infected people (MERS-CoV). SCoV2 will face the
selective pressure (b) as influenza A did. If it escapes this selective pressure, it will remain
among humans and spread every few years. Actually, the change in SCoV2 has begun; they have
formed several classes within the short emergence time (Fig. 3c, 6b). The magnitudes of the PC

20

may show the migration pathways of the classes. They might mutate within China and
transferred to other countries, and mutate further (Fig. S6b). The changes could be acclimation to
humans (c); however, they may also relate to the herd immunity (b) and/or lower lethality (d).
Fortunately, the lifespan of the classes of coronaviruses should be shorter than that of the
influenza virus. The ORF lengths for the influenza virus are within a certain range, but some of

25

the ORFs of coronavirus are quite short, e.g. the envelope protein, which is located in the
conserved outermost region of the virus (24) (Fig. 2 and S3). It seems that this protein is too
short to form a variable structure. Therefore, this will be a good target for herd immunity and
these conservative ORFs might be suitable to produce vaccines. In contrast, the Spike protein
tends to change (Fig. S3a, S3b), and may cause antibody-dependent enhancement (25).

30

Many bat coronaviruses seemed to be able to infect humans. The bat and human viruses are
similar (Fig. 1) and there are more variations in bats, of which only a part we have observed. Due

to replication errors and RNA editing, a bat may possess several virus variants (5). Although
host-virus specificities are shown in laboratory experiments (19), as both humans and other
animals have individual variations, the barrier would be more fragile in reality. Once an infection
occurs, the virus will adapt through mutations, as for the SARS virus (18). Long-term
5

accumulation of mutations in intermediate hosts, such as swine for influenza viruses, is not
essential. These viruses would have a limited infectious character and cause mild symptoms to
bats or other hosts; however, they could show an excessive adaptation to humans as SARS- and
MERS-CoV did. As humans do not have herd immunity to many classes of coronaviruses (they
do not contain HCoV), these might produce a new pandemic.

10

If intermediates are required, its main contribution could be the amplification of the inoculum
size and contact frequency. Bats and human habitats are different, and a bat may not egest
enough viruses to infect different hosts. The size of the donor animal is important, e.g. healthcare
workers with secondary MERS infections tend to have milder symptoms and a better prognosis
(23). This could be caused by differences in inoculum sizes; as camels produce plenty of nasal

15

secretions full of viruses (22, 26), the inoculum size would be larger than that from humans. To
prevent the production of intermediate animals, live animals should not be kept in the same
place. Additionally, identifying the first patients is essential to prevent a human outbreak. Thus,
people who frequently contact with living wildlife should not stay in a cosmopolitan city.
The conventional classification system of coronavirus did not coincide with the relationships of

20

the sequence data; e.g. the categories of Alpha- and Beta-coronavirus were too wide.
Additionally, many of the credits for classification of original sequencing records were
misjudged as well as those of the influenza virus. Using an objective method is preferable to
determine the attributions (4).
