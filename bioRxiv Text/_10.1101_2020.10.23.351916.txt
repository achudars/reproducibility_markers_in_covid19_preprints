Abstract
The severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is responsible for COVID19, a new
emerging pandemic affecting humans. Here, single viruses were analyze by atomic force microscopy (AFM)
operating directly in a level 3 biosafety (BSL3) facility, which appeared as a fast and powerful method to
assess infectious virus morphology in its native conformation, or upon inactivation treatments, at the
nanoscale level and in 3D. High resolution AFM reveals structurally intact infectious and inactivated SARSCoV-2 upon low concentration of formaldehyde treatment. This protocol allows the preparation of intact
inactivated SARS-CoV-2 particles for safe use of samples out of level 3 laboratory, as revealed by combining
AFM and plaque assays, to accelerate researches against the COVID-19 pandemic. Overall, we illustrate how
adapted BSL3-atomic force microscopy is a remarkable toolbox for rapid and direct virus identification and
characterization.

Main
SARS-CoV-2 has emerged as a new zoonotic coronavirus in late 2019 in Wuhan, China, and rapidly spread
worldwide, causing a global pandemic 1,2. This novel virus is classified as a hazard group 3 pathogen in most
countries, which thus requires researches in level 3 biosafety facilities. Proper inactivation methods are
therefore crucial to transfer the material from high confinement space towards a standard laboratory,
facilitating researches under safe working conditions. Virus inactivation can be achieved in many ways, like

the application of heat, alcohol, peroxide, radiation, fixatives or detergents, and have been described for
coronaviruses3–6. However, these procedures may impair the structural features of the viruses, which can
be necessary for many applications and diagnosis based on morphology. Published experimental data that
demonstrate SARS-CoV-2 inactivation keeping intact particles are lacking. We therefore proposed here a
simple method allowing the inactivation of SARS-CoV2 virions while maintaining their native morphology.
We first controlled that the virus isolate was SARS-CoV-2 by means of revealing the presence of the M, N
and S viral proteins in infected cell lysates using immunoblots, by quantitative RT-PCR, targeting the E gene,
overtime on the cell culture supernatant and by imaging fixed infected cells by Transmission Electron
Microscopy (TEM) (supplementary Figure 1). One can see that the infected cells are producing SARS-CoV-2.
We then directly visualized native infectious SARS-CoV-2 from the clarified infected cell supernatant using
a BSL3 customized AFM, which is a non-destructive and non-intrusive imaging technique particularly
powerful to directly visualize biological samples in physiological conditions, such as viruses7–9. This AFM
major advantage is its simple physical operating principle10, which allows a fast 3D analysis of hydrated,
intact particles and virion size distribution in buffer, without any treatment or staining, after smooth
adsorption of the sample on a poly-L-lysine coated mica surface. We implemented this instrument in BSL3, which allowed us to image native infectious SARS-CoV-2 particles at high resolution in quantitative
imaging AFM mode within minutes from cell supernatant (Figure 1a) or after a simple washing procedure
(Figure 2). Native infectious SARS-CoV-2 virions appeared on the AFM images as roughly spherical or
ellipsoidal (Figure 1), consistent with electron micrographs11,12. Surprisingly, most of the viral particles
appeared embedded in a network of thin filamentous structures adhering to the surface (Figure 1a and
supplementary Figure 2), in addition to free particles, suggesting that SARS-CoV-2 particles are released
form the infected culture cells in packages. As noted elsewhere12, spikes of the S protein appear highly
fragile and the majority of AFM images showed “bald” viral particles without or very low S trimers protruding
from the viral surface, even from viruses directly imaged from cell supernatant. This is probably due to virion
movements on the mica surface during adsorption, causing them to lose and/or break the long spike
proteins. We found however some viruses studded with thin, nail-like structures ranging from 14 to 22 nm,
attached to the virion membrane and flattened on the mica surface, suggesting Spike trimers, as in 11 (Figure
1b). Using height profiles in AFM, particle diameters ranged from 45 to 140 nm, with mean diameter of 91
nm, consistent with diameters measured by cryo-electron tomography for SARS-CoV-2 11,12 and for other
coronaviruses13. TEM observation of the virus producing cells confirmed unambiguously the typical
structure of coronavirus particles, containing granular densities corresponding to the viral nucleoprotein
and showing protruding spikes S proteins incorporated into the viral lipid envelope14 (Figure 1D). By TEM,

dehydrated particles show diameters distribution in the range from 40 to 95 nm, in good accordance with
the known ≈25% shrinkage of samples with the dehydration procedure used here for sample preparation15.
We then examined and compared virus inactivation using formaldehyde (FA), and by heat, to identify a
condition keeping structurally intact SARS-CoV-2 particles. Upon heat or FA treatments, followed by ultrafiltration, viral particles were analyzed directly by AFM for morphology (compare Figure 2a for WT with no
treatment with Figure 2b with treatments) and plaque assays for infectivity (Table 1, supplementary Figure
3). SARS-CoV-2 incubated at 58°C for 30 minutes was successfully inactivated (Table 1), as described for
other coronavirus4,5. AFM analysis showed severely damaged particles that have lost their spherical shapes
(Figure 2b). Aldehyde fixation is well established in histology and EM16. Unlike glutaraldehyde, which can
cause aggregates, buffered FA has been shown to preserve virus morphology17, and its virucidal efficiency
is very well documented, e.g., in vaccination programs18,19. We observed complete inactivation of SARSCoV-2 after incubation at 20°C for 30 min with 0.5%, 1%, 2% or 3.6% FA (see Table 1) evaluating infectivity
by plaque assays (supplementary Figure 3). AFM analysis showed unaltered particles with a shape similar to
the untreated control upon 0.5% or 1% FA treatment (Figure 2b), while the higher percentage dramatically
damaged the viruses, whose morphology is then similar to the samples heated to 58 °C (Figure 2b). As
shown previously4,17, FA inactivation effect was temperature dependent and was strongly reduced at 4°C.
Indeed, SARS-CoV-2 was still infectious for a lower concentration of 0.1% FA with an incubation at 4°C (Table
1, supplementary Figure 3). Altogether, these results show that SARS-CoV-2 at a concentration of 1-2.106
PFU/ml are inactivated at 20°C using 0.5% or 1% FA for 30min at RT, without loss of virus physical integrity.
In contrario, keeping the virus at 4°C in buffer, or up to 48h at 20°C, has no incidence on its titer (Table 1)
indicating a strong stability of this virus in buffer, probably due to its embedded filamentous form (Figure
1a and supplementary Figure 2).
In summary, in front of the urgent need to perform researches on SARS-CoV-2 to fight COVID-19, the
inactivation methods described here will contribute to transfer the virus from the confined laboratory to
lower biosafety class laboratory in its inactivated form preserving its particle round shape. We show that
low percentage of FA treatment allow to retain the physical integrity of the particles albeit non infectious.
High resolution AFM analysis of SARS-CoV-2 in buffer also demonstrates its ability to provide direct and fast
qualitative information on infectious virus morphology and proves to be a method of choice for analyzing
viral preparations with exceptional precision and rapidity.

Materials and Methods
Virus and cell culture
VeroE6 cells (African green monkey kidney cells) were obtained from ECACC and maintained in Dulbecco’s
minimal essential medium (DMEM) supplemented with 10% heat inactivated fetal bovine serum (FBS) at
37°C with 5% CO2. The strain BetaCoV/France/IDF0372/2020, was supplied by the National Reference
Center for Respiratory Viruses hosted by Institut Pasteur (Paris, France) and headed by Pr. Sylvie van der
Werf. The human sample from which strain BetaCoV/France/IDF0372/2020 was isolated has been provided
by Dr. X. Lescure and Pr. Y. Yazdanpanah from the Bichat Hospital, Paris, France. Moreover, the
BetaCoV/France/IDF0372/2020 strain was supplied through the European Virus Archive goes Global (EVAg)
platform, a project that has received funding from the European Union's Horizon 2020 research and
innovation program under the grant agreement No 653316. For supplementary Figure 3 (panel d) we used
a SARS-CoV-2 strain isolated from CPP Ile de France III, n°2020-A00935−34 and CRB Collection of the
University Hospital of Montpellier, France (www.chu-montpellier.fr). Both virus strains were propagated in
VeroE6 cells with DMEM containing 2.5% FBS at 37°C with 5% CO2 and were harvested 72 hours post
inoculation. Virus stocks were stored at -80°C.
Quantitative reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR)
RNAs from mock infected or infected (MOI=0.001) cell culture supernatant were extracted using the
Nucleospin Dx Virus RNA purification kit (Macherey-Nagel). Then qRT-PCR was performed in triplicate as

performed with a nCoV-E-Sarbeco-Control Plasmid (Eurofins Genomics).
Western Blot
VeroE6 cells were infected for 2h with SARS-CoV-2 (MOI = 0.001). 96h post infection, cells were washed
twice in PBS, detached with versen, pelleted at 250 x g for 6min and lysed in RIPA buffer. Total protein
concentration was calculated using a Bradford protein assay kit. 20µg of total cell lysates were diluted in
Laemmli buffer and proteins were separated by SDS-PAGE on 8% (for S-protein) and 10% (for M- and Nprotein) acrylamide gels. Gels were transferred to PVDF membrane using wet transfer with Tris-glycinemethanol buffer. Membranes were washed in TBS, blocked with 5% milk in TBS-T for 30min and incubated
overnight at 4°C with primary antibody specific for spike (Gentex, cat# GTX632604), N-protein (Gentex, cat#

GTX632269) or M-protein (Tebu, cat# 039100-401-A55), all three diluted at 1:1,000 in TBS-T. After washing
with 5% milk in TBS-T, the membranes were incubated with HRP conjugated anti-mouse antibodies for N
and S protein, and with HRP conjugated anti-rabbit antibody for M protein for 2h at room temperature,
washed again in TBS-T, incubated with ECL reagent (Amersham cat#RPN2236) and imaged using a Chemidoc
Imager (Biorad).
Virus inactivation
All inactivation conditions were performed with a starting viral stock of 1-2.106 plaque forming units/ml
(PFU/ml). Heat inactivation was performed by incubating 100 μl of SARS-CoV-2 stock at 58°C for 30 min.
Formaldehyde inactivation were performed by incubating 90µl of virus supplied by 10x FA-Hepes (0.5M) at
4°C or RT (20°C) for 30min, 2h or up to overnight at 4°C depending on the conditions described in Table 1.
Samples of Figure 2 and supplementary Figure 3 (panels a,b,c “column washed”) were complemented with
PBS up to 5 ml and washed using centrifugal concentrator (Microsep advance 100KDa MWCO, Pall
corporation) at 1000xg at 4°C for 5 minutes. Samples were washed 4 times by filling again the concentrator
with 5ml of PBS and repeating the centrifugation. The last centrifugation was processed until 200 µl
remained, the virus sample was collected and stored at 4°C for one night before plaque assays. Samples of
supplementary Figure 3 (panel d “ultracentrifuged”) were diluted into 4ml PBS after FA inactivation, loaded
over a 20% sucrose cushion-TNE and ultracentrifuged at 100.000xg for 1h on a SW55ti Beckman rotor. Viral
samples were resuspended in 20µl DMEM and stored at -80°C. Virus inactivation were monitored in plaque
assay on a monolayer of VeroE6 cells (3,5.105 cells/well), using 200 µl of virus solution. Samples were serially
diluted and the PFU/mL values were determined using crystal violet coloration and subsequent scoring the
amounts of wells displaying cytopathic effects.
Atomic Force Microcopy
Freshly cleaved muscovite mica sheets (V1 grade, Ted Pella, Inc.) were glued on glass slide, coated for 10
minutes at 20°C with 0.1% poly-L-lysine (Sigma), rinsed with 3 ml of buffer A (10 mM Tris–HCl pH 7.5 and
NaCl 100 mM) and dried with a N2 flux. A plastic O-ring (JPK instruments) was then glued on the glass slide
to assemble a small liquid cell. Virus samples were diluted four-fold in buffer A and 200 µL were deposited
on the mica for 15 minutes to allow passive virus adsorption. The liquid cell was next completed with 200
µl of buffer A before imaging. AFM imaging was performed at room temperature on a NanoWizard IV atomic
force microscope (JPK Instruments-Bruker, Berlin, Germany) mounted on an inverted optical microscope
(Nikon Instruments, Japan) and operating in a BSL3 laboratory. Topographic imaging was performed in
quantitative imaging (QI) mode, which is a force-curve based imaging mode, using BL-AC40TS-C2 cantilevers

(mean cantilever spring constant kcant = 0.09 N/m, Olympus). Before each experiment, sensitivity and spring
constant (thermal noise method) of cantilever were calibrated. The applied force was kept at 0.15 nN and
a constant approach/retract speed of 40 µm.s−1 (z range of 100 nm). Images were flattened with a
polynomial/histogram line-fit with the JPK data processing software. Low-pass Gaussian and/or median
filtering was applied to remove minor noise from the images. The Z-color scale in all images is given as
relative after processing, with the offset being kept the same within each of the figures to emphasize the
structural features.
Electron Microcopy
VeroE6 cells were infected with 1.106 PFU of SARS-CoV-2 for 24h. Cells were fixed with 2,5% (v/v)
glutaraldehyde in PHEM buffer and post fixed in osmium tetroxide 1% / K4Fe(CN)6 0,8%, at room
temperature for 1h for each treatment. The samples were then dehydrated in successive ethanol bathes
(50/70/90/100%) and infiltrated with propylene oxide/ EMbed812 mixes before embedding. 70 nm
ultrathin cuts were made on a PTXL ultramicrotome (RMC, France), stained with OTE/lead citrate and
observed on a Tecnai G2 F20 (200kV, FEG) TEM at the Electron Microscopy Facility MRI-COMET, INM, PlateForme Montpellier RIO Imaging, Biocampus, Montpellier.
