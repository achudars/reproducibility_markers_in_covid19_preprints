Abstract
Main protease (Mpro, also known as 3CLpro) has a major role in the replication of
coronavirus life cycle and is one of the most important drug targets for anticoronavirus
agents. Here we report the crystal structure of main protease of SARS-CoV-2 bound to
a previously identified Chinese herb inhibitor shikonin at 2.45 angstrom resolution.
Although the structure revealed here shares similar overall structure with other
published structures, there are several key differences which highlight potential
features that could be exploited. The catalytic dyad His41-Cys145 undergoes dramatic
conformational changes, and the structure reveals an unusual arrangement of oxyanion
loop stabilized by the substrate. Binding to shikonin and binding of covalent inhibitors
show different binding modes, suggesting a diversity in inhibitor binding. As we learn
more about different binding modes and their structure-function relationships, it is
probable that we can design more effective and specific drugs with high potency that
can serve as effect SARS-CoV-2 anti-viral agents.

Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), an RNA virus,
infects the general population at different ages and can cause severe acute respiratory
syndrome in high risk individuals.1 The main protease (Mpro, also known as 3CLpro) is
essential for the production of infectious virions and play a critical role in the
replication of SARS-CoV-2.2 Mpro is thus an attractive target for the development of
drugs against SARS-CoV-2 and other coronavirus infections. Mpro of SARS-CoV-2 is
a cysteine protease with relatively high sequence homology to other coronavirus main
proteases. The catalytic dyad of Mpro is formed by His41 and Cys145. A number of
studies using either in silico ligand docking or drug discovery based on available
structures have been performed to discover new Mpro binding agents. Currently, the
inhibitors designed for Mpro are covalently bound and peptidomimetic, both properties
which lend themselves to potential toxicity due to non-specific reactions with host
proteins.

One

previously

identified

(1-hydroxy-4-methyl-3-pentenyl)-1,4

inhibitor

was

(±)-5,8-dihydroxy-2-

naphthoquinone, termed shikonin, which

derives a Chinese herb, and is a major active component of the roots of Lithospermum
erythrorhizon.4
To find new scaffold and non-covalent inhibitors and reveal further details of
inhibitor binding, we determined the crystal structure of Mpro in complex with
shikonin. The structure reveals a novel binding mode that opens new opportunities for
future drug development targeting the Mpro protease (Fig. 1a, b). Shikonin and its
derivatives have been reported to have antiviral, antibacterial, anti-inflammatory and
anti-tumor effects.4,5 Previous data have shown shikonin has 15.75 μM IC50 to Mpro
protease.5 These data, in combination with the structure revealed in this study
highlight shikonin as a starting point for developing future novel non-covalent
antiviral molecules.
Overall structure
The crystal structure of Mpro in complex with shikonin (ShiMpro) has been
determined at 2.45 Å resolution using a previously described Mpro construct (Table 1,
Fig. 2a).

Shi

Mpro structure shows the same overall fold observed for the previous apo

state structure of Mpro at pH 7.5 (apoMpro).3 The r.m.s. difference in equivalent Cα
positions between apo and ShiMpro is roughly 0.3 Å for all the residues (Fig. 1c). Some
key residues in the oxyanion hole and N-finger were found to be disordered in the apo
state structure. These residues are located near the active site of the enzyme and

therefore participate in the binding of substrates or inhibitors. However, unlike the
apo state of Mpro at pH 7.5, the current structure contains residues with clear density
for both protomers of the protease in the crystal. Interestingly, shikonin binds to
protomer A but not to protomer B (Fig. 2b, c). The reasons are unclear but may be
due to the relatively low affinity of shikonin.5 Structurally, the two monomers have
essentially similar conformation with slight difference in oxyanion loop (Fig. 3).
There are, however, remarkable differences both in the conformation of the protease
monomer between this inhibitor-bound complex and the apo state reported earlier by
us.3 Residues in the oxyanion loop became more ordered due to inhibitor binding, as
residues 140-145 appear to interact with the inhibitor. Notably, an unprecedented
conformational difference in the catalytic dyad His41 and Cys145 is observed,
leading to a steric clash between the previously reported inhibitors and His41-Cys145
catalytic site (Fig. 1d).5-9
Unique binding mode of the non-covalent inhibitor shikonin
An overlay of the

Shi

Mpro structure with previously solved inhibitor-bound

structures shows relatively high spatial conservation of the three domains (Fig. 1c, Fig.
4). Shikonin contains 1,4-naphthoquinone (1,4-NQ) that consists of a benzene moiety
and a fully conjugated cyclic diketone with the carbonyls are arranged in para position,
referred to as the inhibitor head group, and a chiral six-carbon side-chain with the
hydroxy group at C-1, defined as the ligand tail. The inhibitor binding pocket can be
described as a narrow cleft surrounded by S1-S4 subsites (Fig. 1c). Shikonin
establishes a hydrogen bond network with the protease polar triad Cys145, His164
and Met165 located on the S1 subsite. The aromatic head groups of shikonin forms a

π-π interaction with His41 on the S2 subsite. The hydroxy and methyl group of the
isohexenyl side chain tail has two H-bonding with Gln189 and Thr190 on the S3
subsite, respectively. Superimposing

Shi

Mpro with other inhibitor-bound structures

reveals striking difference in the arrangement of the catalytic dyad His41-Cys145 and
smaller, but substantial, differences in Phe140 and Glu166. In both covalent
inhibitors-bound structures, the inhibitor binds to the Sγ atom of Cys145. In the case
of current structure with shikonin, the side chain of Cys145 adopts a different
configuration, forming hydrogen bond with shikonin (Fig. 1d, e). In addition, the
imidazole group of His41 pointing towards the binding pocket in other structures flip
outward, opening a way for the entry of shikonin. The distances between His41 Nε2

and Cys145 Sγ are 5.3 Å in

Shi

Mpro structure, and the distance is significantly longer

than that observed in any other main protease of reported structures (Fig. 1d).5-9
Phe140 no longer has π-π interaction with His163, and the phenyl ring of Phe140
undergoes dramatic conformational change and moves outward to the solvent (Fig.
1d). The side chain of Glu166 is flexible and adopts an inactive conformation in both
apo and ShiMpro structures, but is well ordered in the other known structures (Fig. 1d).
It has been shown that Glu166 is critical in keeping the substrate binding pocket in a
suitable shape by forming hydrogen bond with peptidomimetic inhibitors and N
terminal residue in the other protomer.8 This may explain why Glu166 is strictly
conserved among all main proteases.
Two water molecules in the active site of the protease.
The

apo

Mpro structure reveals the presence of two water molecules in the substrate

binding site (Fig. 5a). Water 1 forms hydrogen bond network involving Phe140,
His163 and Glu166 located in the S1 pocket, stabilizing the oxyanion hole in the apo
state structure.3 Another water molecular (water 2) hydrogen bonded with His41 and
Cys145 in the apo state structure is occupied by the shikonin in the

Shi

Mpro structure

(Fig. 5b). However, these two water molecules are not observed in the

Shi

Mpro

structure. We propose that inhibitors that are able to replace these water molecules
may have significant improvement of potency for the protease, as was observed when
the two water molecules in the substrate binding pocket of Mpro are replaced by the
inhibitors (Fig. 5c).5-9
Conclusion
The current global pandemic has increased the urgency for novel small molecule
inhibitors to slow or block SARS-CoV-2 viral propagation. Here we have shown that
the napthoquinone, shikonin, binds in a unique mode to the Mpro protease. Our
structure reveals three novel interactions in the substrate/inhibitor binding pocket, 1)
the π stacking interaction between the shikonin naphthoquinone core and side chain of
His41 from the S2 subsite, 2) hydrogen bonds with Cys145, His164 and Met165 in
the S1 pocket and 3) hydrogen bonds with Gln189 and Thr190 in the S3 pocket (Fig.
1e, f). To date it has been shown that the covalent and peptidomimetic inhibitors
identified bind to S1/S2/S4 site, while camfour only binds to the S2 subsite and
another natural product baicalein binds to the S1/S2 pocket (Fig. 1g).5-9 The

structure highlights a new binding mode of non-covalent and natural product

and represents an exciting novel scaffold derived from a Chinese medicinal herb. The
Mpro structure identified here in complex with natural product shikonin provides an
invaluable resource to design improved antiviral drugs for this important therapeutic
target.

Materials and Methods
Protein purification and crystallization
The cDNA of full-length SARS-Cov-2 main protease 3CL (NC_045512) was
optimized, synthesized (Generay, China) and cloned into the pET28a vector. The
plasmid was transformed into competent cell E.coli Rosetta DE3. The bacteria were
grown in 800mL of LB (Luria-Bertani) broth at 37

℃. When the OD600 reach 0.6-0.8,

500 μM IPTG was added to induce the E. coli expression and then incubated 3-5h at

℃

30 . The cells were centrifuged at 10000 g for 15min at 4

℃, the supernatant

discarded, and the precipitate collected. Buffer A (100 mM Tris/HCl buffer, pH7.5,
300 mM NaCl 10mM imidazole and 5% glycerol) was added to resuspend the
collected cells, which were broken up by a JNBIO 3000 plus (JNBI). The supernatant
containing the protein was acquired by centrifugation at 30000 g, 4

supernatant was transferred into a 5 ml Ni-NTA Ni2+-nitrilotriacetate column (GE
healthcare) and the protein wanted was loaded onto the column. Buffer B(100 mM
Tris/HCl buffer

，pH 7.5，300 mM NaCl ,100 mM imidazole，and 5% glycerol) was

added into beads as a 30 times column wash. The His tagged protein was eluted by
buffer C (50 mM Tris-HCl pH 7.5, 300 mM NaCl and 300 mM imidazole). A
Superdex 200 PG gel filtration column (GE healthcare) was used to purify the protein
and remove the imidazole, and the buffer changed to buffer C(25 mM HEPES buffer

analyzed by SDS-PAGE. Positive fractions containing the protein were flash-frozen
in liquid nitrogen and stored at -80

℃.

The protein was thawed and concentrate at 10 mg/ml in Amicon Ultra-15,10000Mr
cut-off centrifugal concentrator (Millipore). 10 mM shikonin was added to the protein

Data collection, structure determination and refinement.
The crystals were tailored with cryo-loop (Hampton research, America) and then
flash-frozen in liquid nitrogen to collect better X-ray data. The data set was collected
at 100 K on a macromolecular crystallography beamline17U1 (BL17U1) at Shanghai
Synchrotron Radiation Facility (SSRF, Shanghai, China). All collected data were
handled by the HKL 2000 software package. The structure was determined by
molecular replacement with PHENIX software. The of 7C2Q was referred as a model.
The program Coot was used to rebuild the initial model. The models were refined to
resolution limit 2.45 Å by using the PHENIX software. The complete wanted data
collection and statistics of refinement are shown in Table 1. The structure has been
deposited in PDB (PDB code 7CA8).
