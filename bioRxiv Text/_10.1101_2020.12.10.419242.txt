Abstract

21

Since its emergence in Wuhan, China in December 2019, the severe acute respiratory syndrome

22

coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) has spread worldwide resulting in a global pandemic with >1.5 million

23

deaths until now. In the search for small molecule inhibitors of SARS-CoV-2, drug repurposing is being

24

extensively explored. Molnupiravir (EIDD-2801) is an orally bioavailable nucleoside analog that

25

possesses a relatively broad-spectrum antiviral activity including against coronaviruses. We here

26

studied the effect of EIDD-2801 in a well-established Syrian hamster SARS-CoV2 infection model.

27

Treatment of SARS-CoV-2-infected hamsters with 200 mg/kg BID of EIDD-2801 for four consecutive

28

days, starting from the day of infection, significantly reduced infectious virus titers and viral RNA loads

29

in the lungs and markedly improved lung histopathology. When onset of treatment was delayed until

30

1 or 2 days after infection, a very modest antiviral effect was observed. The potential of EIDD-2801 for

31

the treatment and or prevention of SARS-CoV2 deserves further attention.

Main Text

35

The severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is a β-coronavirus that was first

36

identified in Wuhan, China in December 2019 (1). Since then, the virus rapidly spread around the globe

37

with more than 66 million cases reported by the end of 2020, including >1.5 million deaths

38

[https://covid19.who.int/]. Infection with SARS-CoV-2 results in COVID-19 which is characterized by a

39

wide range of symptoms including fever, dry cough, muscle and/or joint pain, headache, decreased

40

sense of taste and smell and diarrhea. The disease can also progress into severe complications such as

41

acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), respiratory failure, septic shock and multi-organ failure,

42

which are mainly attributed to a massive cytokine storm and exaggerated immune response (2).

43

To date, there are no approved, specific antiviral drugs or vaccines available to treat or prevent

44

infections with human coronaviruses. The use of potent antivirals against SARS-CoV-2 will reduce viral

45

loads and may hence reduce the chance to progress to a severe disease. In addition, such antiviral

46

drugs could be useful to protect for example health care workers and high-risk groups in a prophylactic

47

setting. Since the de novo development and approval of (a) specific, highly potent antiviral(s) for SARS-

48

CoV-2 may take years, the main focus for COVID-19 treatment in the current pandemic is to repurpose

49

drugs that have been approved or in clinical trials for other diseases (3).

50

The ribonucleoside analogue, N4-hydroxycytidine (NHC, EIDD-1931), has broad-spectrum antiviral

51

activity against multiple viruses belonging to different families of RNA viruses. Activity against SARS-

52

CoV and SARS-CoV-2 has been reported in cell lines and primary human airway epithelial cell cultures

53

(4). Acting through lethal mutagenesis, its incorporation into viral RNA results in the accumulation of

54

deleterious transition mutations beyond a permissible error threshold to sustain the virus population,

55

leading to error catastrophe (5). The orally bioavailable, pro-drug counterpart of NHC (6), Molnupiravir

56

(EIDD-2801, MK-4482) is currently being assessed for its potential as an antiviral treatment of SARS-

57

CoV-2 infection in Phase 2 clinical trials of infected patients (NCT04405570, NCT04405739). To our

58

knowledge, three very recent studies reported on activity of orally dosed EIDD-2801 in SARS-CoV-2

infected animals. Oral treatment of SARS-CoV2 infected Syrian hamsters with EIDD-2801 resulted in

60

marked reduction of viral loads when administered either in a pre- or post-exposure settings (7). In a

61

ferret model, EIDD-2801 significantly reduced virus load in a therapeutic setting and blocked SARS-

62

CoV-2 contact transmission (8), while in a humanized mouse model, EIDD-2801 prevented SARS-CoV-

63

2 infection in a pre-exposure prophylaxis setting (9).

64

Recently, we have established and characterized a Syrian Gold (SG) hamster model for the evaluation

65

of antiviral drugs against SARS-CoV-2 (10, 11). Using this model, we have shown that a high dose of the

66

influenza drug Favipiravir results in a pronounced antiviral activity in SARS-CoV-2 infected hamsters,

67

whereas hydroxychloroquine lacks antiviral activity in this model. Here, we use the same hamster

68

model to assess the anti-SARS-COV2 of EIDD-2801 against SARS-CoV-2 in infected hamsters.

69

First, we evaluated the effect when the drug was administered at a dose of either 75 or 200 mg/kg BID.

70

Briefly, 6-8 weeks female SG hamsters were treated with the intended dose of the compound or the

71

vehicle (i.e. the control group) for four consecutive days starting one hour before intranasal infection

72

with 50 µL containing 2×106 TCID50 SARS-CoV-2 [BetaCov/Belgium/GHB-03021/2020 (EPI ISL 109

73

407976|2020-02-03)]. At day four post-infection (pi), the animals were euthanized and lungs were

74

collected for quantification of viral RNA, infectious virus titers and lung histopathology as described

75

previously (10) (Fig. 1A). Treatment of hamsters with 75 mg/kg BID EIDD-2801 resulted in 1.2 log10

76

reduction in the viral RNA copies per mg of lung tissue (P=0.01), compared to the vehicle-treated

77

infected hamsters (Fig. 1B). On the other hand, in the lungs of hamsters that had been treated with

78

200 mg/kg BID EIDD-2801 a 3log10 reduction in the viral RNA copies/mg of lung tissue was noted (P

79

<0.0001) (Fig. 1B). A similar pattern was observed for the infectious virus load in the lungs, the high

80

dose of 200 mg/kg, but not the 75 mg/kg dose, reduced infectious virus lung titers by 3.3 log10

81

(P<0.0001) TCID50 per mg (Fig. 1C).

95

Importantly, treatment with 200 mg/kg EIDD-2801 BID significantly reduced the histological lung

96

disease score (P=0.001), whereas the lower dose resulted only in slight reduction in lung pathology

97

(P=0.05, ns, Fig. 1D). Both doses were well-tolerated without significant weight loss or any obvious

98

adverse effects (Fig. 1E).

99

We next explored whether the high dose can also be used in a post-exposure setting, i.e. when

100

treatment is started at 24 or 48 h after infection (Fig. 2A). Delaying the start of treatment with EIDD-

101

2801 (200 mg/kg, BID) by 1 or 2 days resulted in a loss of potency with only a rather slight reduction

102

of viral RNA copies/mg lung [0.3 to 0.4 log10 respectively] (Fig. 2B). Similarly, virus titrations of the lung

103

tissues also revealed no significant reduction of infectious virus load in both groups with delayed

104

treatment compared with the vehicle-treated group (Fig. 2C). However, a modest but significant

105

reduction of the histological lung disease score was observed in both the day 1 (p=0.016) and day 2

106

(p=0.01) delayed treatment groups (Fig. 2D). These results suggest that even if the delayed treatment

107

with the 200 mg/kg BID dose was not sufficient to efficiently stop the viral replication, it may still able

108

to delay the disease progression in the lung of infected hamsters.

109

In summary, EIDD-2801 is able to markedly reduce, albeit at a relatively high dose, SARS-CoV2 infection

110

and virus induced pathology in hamsters, in particular when given at the time of Infection. EIDD-2801

111

has been previously demonstrated to exert antiviral activity against MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV in cell

112

culture and mouse models. Very recently activity was also reported against SARS-CoV-2 (4, 8, 9). In

113

another SARS-CoV2 Syrian hamster model, 250 mg/kg of EIDD-2801 was given orally every 12 hours

114

starting either 12 hours pre-infection or 12 hours post-infection (7). Although a slightly higher

115

compound dose (250 mg/kg, BID) and a much lower virus inoculum (5×102 TCID50) was used in their

116

hamster study, the observed antiviral effect was less pronounced (1 log10 reduction in viral RNA and 2

117

log10 reduction in infectious virus titers) than in our study (7).

130

EIDD-2801 has also been reported to be effective in SARS-CoV infected C57/BL6 mice either when

131

administered prophylactically (start of treatment 2 h before infection) or therapeutically (start of

132

treatment delayed until 48 hpi) at a dose of 500 mg/kg twice daily (Sheahan et al., 2020). In a

133

humanized mouse model of SARS-CoV-2 infection, pre-exposure (prophylaxis) (12 h before infection)

134

with 500 mg/kg of EIDD-2801 twice daily was efficacious in preventing SARS-CoV-2 infection, with a ~6

135

log10 reduction in virus lung titers (9). In a very recent report, EIDD-2801 was found to markedly reduce

136

SARS-CoV-2 viral titers in in the upper respiratory tract of ferrets when start of treatment was delayed

137

until 12 hpi to 36 hpi. Moreover, treating SARS-CoV2 infected ferrets with EIDD-2801 starting at 12 hpi

138

prevented contact transmission when they were co-housed with non-infected untreated contact

139

ferrets (8).

140

Our results are consistent with other recent studies (in hamster, mouse and ferret models) showing

141

that pre-emptive and early intervention with oral EIDD-2801 results in antiviral activity. However, at a

142

dose of 200 mg/kg we did not observe a reduction of virus in the lung when treatment was initiated

143

24 to 48 hpi in our Syrian hamster model (although some improvement in lung pathology was observed

144

in these groups). Further studies are ongoing to explore therapeutic (delayed start of treatment) effect

145

at higher doses.

146

The antiviral drug, Remdesivir (Veklury), is the first treatment for COVID-19 to receive FDA approval

147

for use in hospitalised patients, although the World Health Organisation has recently recommended

148

against

use

150

against-the-use-of-remdesivir-in-covid-19-patients). Both Remdesivir and EIDD-2801 are nucleoside

151

analogues acting on the viral RNA replication pathway, with Remdesivir resulting in chain termination

152

and EIDD-2801 in lethal mutagenesis (5, 12). Additionally, both have a high resistance barrier, with

153

resistant viral mutants having a loss in fitness (6, 13). However, Remdesivir needs to be administrated

154

intravenously, whereas EIDD-2801 can be dosed via the oral route. This is a significant advantage in

its

155

terms of the practicalities of treatment management, where we can envision that asymptomatic

156

patients who have had high-risk contact or patients presenting mild symptoms are prescribed EIDD-

157

2801 pills in a non-hospitalised setting.

158

By demonstrating the antiviral efficacy of the orally-bioavailable EIDD-2801 against SARS-CoV-2 in the

159

Syrian hamster model, we contribute to the pre-clinical profiling of EIDD-2801, and provide further

160

evidence in support of the ongoing Phase II clinical trials. The outcomes of these trials could play a

161

pivotal role in the control and management of this devastating pandemic.
