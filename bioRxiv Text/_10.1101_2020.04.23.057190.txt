Abstract

The infection coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is caused by a virus classified as severe
acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). At cellular level, virus infection
initiates with binding of viral particles to the host surface cellular receptor angiotensin
converting enzyme 2 (ACE2).

SARS-CoV-2 engages ACE2 as the entry receptor and

employs the cellular serine protease 2 (TMPRSS2) for S protein priming. TMPRSS2 activity
is essential for viral spread and pathogenesis in the infected host. Understanding how
TMPRSS2 protein expression in the lung varies in the population could reveal important
insights into differential susceptibility to influenza and coronavirus infections. Here, we
systematically analyzed coding-region variants in TMPRSS2 and the eQTL variants, which
may affect the gene expression, to compare the genomic characteristics of TMPRSS2 among
different populations. Our findings suggest that the lung-specific eQTL variants may confer
different susceptibility or response to SARS-CoV-2 infection from different populations
under the similar conditions. In particular, we found that the eQTL variant rs35074065 is
associated with high expression of TMPRSS2 but with a low expression of the interferon
(IFN)-α/β-inducible gene, MX1, splicing isoform. Thus, these subjects could account for a
more susceptibility either to viral infection or to a decrease in cellular antiviral response.

Introduction

In December 2019 a new infectious respiratory disease emerged in Wuhan, Hubei province,
China.1-3 Subsequently, it diffused worldwide and became a pandemic. The World Health
Organization (WHO) has officially named the infection coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID19), and the virus has been classified as severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2
(SARS-CoV-2). The mechanism of infection of SARS-CoV-2 is not yet well known; it
appears to have affinity for cells located in the lower airways, where it replicates.4 COVID19 cause a severe clinical picture in humans, ranging from mild malaise to death by
sepsis/acute respiratory distress syndrome.
At cellular level, virus infections initiate with binding of viral particles to host surface
cellular receptors.5,6 Receptor recognition is therefore an important determinant of the cell
and tissue tropism of a virus. Recently, human angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) was
reported as an entry receptor for SARS-CoV-2.3 Moreover, the spike (S) protein of
coronaviruses facilitates viral entry into target cells. Entry depends on binding of the surface
unit, S1, of the S protein to a cellular receptor, which facilitates viral attachment to the
surface of target cells. SARS-CoV-2 engages ACE2 as the entry receptor and employs the
cellular serine protease 2 (TMPRSS2) for S protein priming.5 TMPRSS2 activity is essential
for viral spread and pathogenesis in the infected host.7-10 TMPRSS2 as a host cell factor is
critical for spread of several clinically relevant viruses, including influenza A viruses and
coronaviruses.7,10,11-16 TMPRSS2 is a cell surface protein that is expressed by epithelial cells
of specific tissues including those in the aerodigestive tract. It is dispensable for development
and homeostasis and thus, constitutes an attractive drug target.13 In this context, it is
noteworthy that the serine protease inhibitor camostat mesylate, which blocks TMPRSS2
activity has been approved in Japan for human use, but for an unrelated indication.10,14
Due to the crucial role of TMPRSS2 in the viral infection, we analyzed its genetic landscape
in different populations trying to find a possible genetic predisposition to SARS-CoV-2
infection.

Results

To systematically investigate the candidate functional variants in TMPRSS2 and the allele
frequency (AF) differences between 17 populations with different ethnic origin, we analyzed
all the 1025 variants in TMPRSS2 gene region downloaded from the gnomAD browser and
annotated with 34 pathogenic variant scores (Supplementary Table S1). The locus region
comprises 496 non-coding and 520 coding variants. The AFs of all the variants located in the
coding region of TMPRSS2 in different largescale genome databases were summarized in
Supplementary Table S2. Forty-three loss-of-function (LoF) variants were annotated in
gnomAD in the TMPRSS2 gene locus. The benign variants were classified by using a
combination of the three algorithms VEST3, REVEL, and RadialSVM and the pathogenic
ones by other three algorithms MutationTaster, Mcap, and CADD as recently suggested.15
The 26% (88/334) of non-synonymous variants has been classified as pathogenic. All these
variants are located along the entire coding region of the gene (Figure 1a), and both missense
pathogenic and LoF variants exhibit very low overall AFs (Figure 1b). This finding agrees
with the recommended benign frequency cut-off of 0.0001 for TMPRSS2 gene, as derived
from the Varsome database (https://varsome.com/). Nevertheless, the distribution of AFs
across the different populations showed the highest percentage in African (AFR) population
within LoF variant class. Similarly, Swedish population exhibited the highest AF for the LoF
variants among the Europeans (Figure 1c). When we looked at non-synonymous pathogenic
variants, we observed the highest AF among Ashkenazi Jewish (ASJ) individuals (Figure 1b),
while Finnish (FIN) showed the highest AF among European subpopulations (Figure 1c). The
AFs of non-synonymous variants classified as benign (198/334, 59.3%) were similarly
distributed among the different populations (Figure 1b-c). The average AFs for all types of
variants here investigated are summarized in Supplementary Table S3.
We also investigated, throughout the GTEx database, the distribution of the expression
quantitative trait loci (eQTL) for TMPRSS2 (Supplementary Table S4). Indeed, we found 203
unique and significant (FDR<0.05) eQTL variants for TMPRSS2 in five different tissues
divided as follows: 136 (66.9%) in lung, 56 (27.6%) in testis, 9 (4.4%) in prostate, 1 (0.5%)
in ovarian and in thyroid (0.5%) tissue.
TMPRSS2 is highly expressed in prostate, testis, stomach, colon-transverse, pancreas, and in
tissues of the respiratory tract, as bronchus, pharyngeal mucosa, and lung. However, no
difference in gene expression between male and female was observed for non-gender specific
tissues (Supplementary Figure S1). The AFs of the 136 eQTL-lung variants were compared

among different populations, but no substantial differences in AF distribution was observed
(Supplementary Figure S2). Nevertheless, the average AF of 76 eQTL-lung variants with
positive normalized effect size (NES) was higher in European populations (FIN, 0.463; NFE,
0.541), whereas the average AF of these variants in East Asian (EAS) population was much
lower (0.085) (Figure 1b and Supplementary Table S3).
Interestingly, the top 25 variants (NES > 0.1) were in a genomic region that includes both
TMPRSS2 and MX1 genes. In particular, the most significant eQTL variant rs35074065 is
located in the intergenic region between the two genes (distance = 2379 from MX1; distance
= 2958 from TMPRSS2) (Figure 2a) and shows the lowest AF in EAS (0.0049) population
(Figure 2b). Of note, this variant is associated with high expression of both TMPRSS2 and
MX1 in lung tissue (Figure 2c). Notably, the same variant is also a splicing (s)QTL associated
with low expression of MX1 splicing isoform in different tissues (Figure 2d).

Discussion

Targeting TMPRSS2 expression and/or activity could be a promising candidate for
potential interventions against COVID-19 given its crucial role in initiating SARS-CoV-2
and other respiratory viral infections.16 Understanding how TMPRSS2 protein expression in
the lung varies in the population could reveal important insights into differential
susceptibility to influenza and coronavirus infections. Immunohistochemical studies, with
limited sample size, suggest that the TMPRSS2 protein is more heavily expressed in
bronchial epithelial cells than in surfactant-producing type II alveolar cells and alveolar
macrophages, and that there is no expression in type I alveolar cells that form the respiratory
surface.17 A recent single-cell RNA-sequencing study, confirmed that TMPRSS2 is expressed
in type 1 d 2 alveolar cells.18 Accordingly, our in-silico analysis supported the high
TMPRSS2 gene expression in tissues of the respiratory tract, as bronchus, pharyngeal
mucosa, and lung. Moreover, it is also considerable to study the genetic variants and the
eQTL of this gene as cause of protein expression variability of TMPRSS2. For example,
patients who carried single nucleotide polymorphisms associated with higher TMPRSS2
expression (rs2070788 and rs383510) were more susceptible to influenza virus infection
A(H7N9) in two separate patient cohorts.19 Our data on eQTL variants showed that the EAS
population has much lower AFs in the eQTL lung-specific variants associated with higher
TMPRSS2 expression in lung, while the European populations have higher AFs for the same
variants. Interestingly, the top eQTL variants were in a genomic region that includes not only
TMPRSS2 gene but also MX1 gene, which encodes a guanosine triphosphate (GTP)metabolizing protein that participates in the cellular antiviral response. MX1 is an interferon
(IFN)-α/β-inducible gene that is widely recognized as an influenza susceptibility gene.20 Of
note, the downregulation of MX1 has been documented in non-responder patients to
interferon-based antiviral therapy of chronic hepatitis C virus infection.21 Our data
demonstrated that subjects with the eQTL associated with high expression of TMPRSS2
could also carry the associated eQTL in the MX1 gene. In particular, we found that the eQTL
variant rs35074065 is associated with high expression of TMPRSS2 but with a low expression
of MX1 splicing isoform. Thus, these subjects could account for a more susceptibility either
to viral infection or to a decrease in cellular antiviral response.
Epidemiological studies across diverse countries including China, Italy, and the United States
showed that the incidence and severity of diagnosed COVID-19 as well as other TMPRSS2dependent viral infections such as influenza may be higher in men than women. Interestingly,

we observed the TMPRSS2 is expressed at high levels in male specific tissues: prostate and
testis. In these latter tissues we also found a high number of eQTLs for TMPRSS2 whose
VAF varied among the different population with the lowest frequency in EAS individuals.
Another possible explanation of gender differences in mortality and morbidity could be the
presence of TMPRSS2:ERG fusion protein in prostate cancer as well as the strong regulation
of TMPRSS2 by androgens. Remarkably, at the mRNA level, constitutive expression of
TMPRSS2 in lung tissue does not appear to differ between men and women.16 Accordingly,
TMPRSS2 gene expression data from GTEx database do not highlight any difference between
male in female. There is a wide variation among both sexes in terms of mRNA expression
levels.16 Low levels of androgens present in women may suffice to sustain TMPRSS2
expression. In addition, TMPRSS2 (and tumors with the TMPRSS2:ERG fusion protein) may
be responsive to estrogen signaling.22,23 It is attractive to speculate that androgen receptorinhibitory therapies might reduce susceptibility to COVID-19 pulmonary symptoms and
mortality.
In summary, we systematically analyzed coding-region variants in TMPRSS2 and the eQTL
variants, which may affect the gene expression, to compare the genomic characteristics of
TMPRSS2 among different populations. Our findings suggested that no direct evidence was
identified genetically supporting the existence of resistant variants for coronavirus S-protein
priming in different populations. The effects of low-frequency missense pathogenic variants,
as well as those of LoF variants for S-protein priming should be further investigated. The
data of variant distribution and AFs may contribute to the further investigations of
TMPRSS2, including its roles in acute lung injury and lung function. Of note, our findings
suggest that the lung-specific eQTL variants may confer different susceptibility or response
to SARS-CoV-2 infection from different populations under the similar conditions. In
conclusion, to know the genetic variability of TMPRSS2 gene will be useful for both the
prognosis and the treatment of the patients affected by COVID-19.

Methods
The variants in TMPRSS2 gene region (chr21:42836478-42903043, 66.566 Kb) were
obtained from the gnomAD v2.1.1 database.24 To analyze the distribution of eQTLs for
TMPRSS2, we used the data from Genotype Tissue Expression (GTEx) database
(https://www.gtexportal.org/home/datasets). Annotation of TMPRSS2 variants and eQTLs
was performed with ANNOVAR by using the pathogenicity prediction tools described in
Supplementary Table S1 and the allele frequencies of human populations reported in
Supplementary Table S5. The reference transcript for TMPRSS2 annotation was
NM_001135099

(ENST00000398585).
