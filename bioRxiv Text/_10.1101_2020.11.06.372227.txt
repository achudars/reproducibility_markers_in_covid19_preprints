depository) of SARS-CoV-2, were observed across six continents. Across all continents, the decreasing order of percentage of
unique variations in the accessory proteins was found to be ORF3a>ORF8>ORF7a>ORF6>ORF10>ORF7b. The highest
and lowest unique variations of ORF3a were observed in South America and Oceania, respectively. This finding suggests
that the wide variations of accessory proteins seem to govern the pathogenicity of SARS-CoV-2, and consequently, certain
propositions and recommendations can be made in the public interest.
Keywords: ORF3a, ORF6, ORF7a, ORF7b, ORF8, ORF10, Pathogenicity, and SARS-CoV-2.

1. Introduction
SARS-CoV-2 (Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus-2), the causative agent for The coronavirus disease 2019
(COVID-19), the pandemic is ongoing with the estimated fatality rate less than 1% [1]. However, the World Health Organization (WHO), Health Emergencies Programme, Executive Director, Dr Michael Ryan, in 2020 October indicated that 760
5

million might have been infected with SARS-CoV-2 which makes the hypothetical fatality rate as 0.14% with approximately
one million lives taken. SARS-CoV-2 is a member of Betacoronavirus (lineage B) genus and Sarbecovirus subgenus was
suggested to diverge from the lineage of Bat Coronavirus (BatCoV) Ratg13 in 1969 with the 95% highest posterior density
interval of the years 1930 to 2000 [2]. Amongst previous Human Coronaviruses (HuCoVs) Severe acute respiratory syndromerelated coronavirus (SARS-CoV) is the closest to SARS-CoV-2 that caused an endemic from 2002 to 2004 [2, 3]. SARS-CoV

10

had 8 open reading frame (ORF) 3a, 3b, 6, 7a, 7b, 8a, 8b, and 9b which were suggested to have more intrinsic and secondary
other than having primary roles in the cell cycle and cellular entry [4, 5]. For instance, the ORFs are transcripted through the
second phase of replication by (+) subgenomic messenger RNAs that were transcripted by the viral replication transcription
complex negative-sense viral RNA coded in the initial stages of SARS-CoV-2 infection [6]. Thus, due to their intrinsic nature
accessory proteins are not positive-selection sites such as extrinsic and primary functional Spike protein receptor-binding

15

domain or protease cleavage sites [7]. Since, clinical SARS-CoV-2 isolates had a high-frequency non-synonymous mutation,
D614G, in their S protein, which increased host cell entry via ACE2 and Transmembrane Protease Serine 2 (TMPRSS2) [8].
Therefore, due to the intrinsic nature and secondary order in the viral transcription, we can expect less selective pressure
and mutations on accessory proteins to reach high-frequency in the population is less expected. Thus, despite the 19 to 89
years of estimated genomic divergence between SARS-CoV-2 and Ratg13, the sequence identity on accessory proteins ORF3,

20

ORF6, ORF7a, ORF7b, ORF8, ORF10 had 98.5, 100, 97.5, 97.6, 95, and 100%, respectively are very high or identical which
is indicating somehow the direct ancestor of SARS-CoV-2 had been exposed to almost no selective pressure to manipulate
its intermediate host immunity for many years until the primary Human infection in Wuhan (Fig.1 to Fig.6) [2].
SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV accessory proteins have differences such as putative protein ORF10 not present in SARSCoV and the ORF3b and ORF9b is not present in SARS-CoV-2 [9, 10]. Very little is known about the functions of accessory

25

proteins of SARS-CoV-2. The known essential features of the six accessory proteins are summarized below.
ORF3a Protein: The ORF3a is the 275 amino acids long largest accessory protein among the accessory proteins coded
by the SARS-CoV-2, has 72.4% sequence identity with SARS-CoV ORF3a protein and has 98.5% sequence identity with
BatCoV Ratg13 ORF3a protein [11, 12] (Fig.1).

Figure 1: ClustalW alignment of SARS-CoV-2 and Ratg13 ORF3 proteins shows 98.5% sequence identity.

ORF3a is involved in virulence, infectivity, ion channel activity, morphogenesis, and virus release [13]. In SARS-CoV
30

ORF3a was a multifunctional protein, co-localized with its protein binding regions with E, M, and S proteins in viral
assembly formed homo-tetrameric complex as potassium-ion channel on host membrane [5]. In SARS-CoV-2, the ion-channel
proteins (viroporins) function of ORF3a in addition to other proteins such as protein E, and ORF8a is critical in CoVs tissue
inflammation [6]. Viroporins mediated lysosomal disruption and ion-redistribution activates innate immune signaling receptor
NLRP3 (NOD-, LRR-, and pyrin domain-containing 3) inflammasome that leads to the expression of inflammatory cytokines

35

such as interleukin 1β (IL-1β), IL-6, and tumor necrosis factor (TNF), causing tissue inflammation during respiratory illness
[6]. From another pathway, ORF3a with its protein binding domains interacts with TNF receptor-associated factor (TRAF3)
protein, which leads ASC ubiquitination, and caspase 1 activation, and IL-1β maturation [14]. Additionally, ORF3a and
ORF7a in combination with E, S, Nsp1 protein, and MAPK pathway proteins (MAPK8, MAPK14, and MAP3K7) trigger
proinflammatory cytokine signaling transcription factors such as STAT1, STAT2, IRF9, and NFKB1 [6]. Another SARS-CoV-

40

2 ORF3a protein interacts with heme oxygenase-1 (HMOX1) that has a role in heme catabolism and the anti-inflammatory
system [6]. SARS-CoV-2 either triggers viral dissemination or suppresses continued viral replication of the apoptosis or
programmed cell death [6]. In SARS-CoV ORF3a E and M protein, ion channel activity interferes with apoptotic pathways
[11].
ORF6 Protein: SARS-CoV-2 ORF6 is a 61 amino acid long membrane-associated interferon (IFN) antagonist protein

45

suppresses the expression of co-transfected expression constructs and its subcellular localization to vesicular structures that
has 68.9% sequence identity, with SARS-CoV ORF6 protein and has 100% sequence identity, with BatCoV Ratg13 ORF6
protein[5] (Fig.2).

frame 1) ORF6 proteins shows 100% sequence identity, despite up to 89 years of genetic diversion.

ORF6 interacts with the karyopherin import complex that limits the movement of transcription factors STAT1 which
down-regulates the IFN pathway [5]. In SARS-CoV ORF6 and ORF3a, in association with other proteins such as M, Nsp1
50

with Nsp3 inhibit IRF3 signalling and repress interferon expression and stimulate the degradation of IFNAR1 and STAT1
[6]. ORF6 interacts with the nsp8 protein coded by SARS-CoV-2 and it can increase infection during early infection at a
low multiplicity with increase in RNA polymerase activity [15]. It is reported that ORF6 and ORF8 can inhibit the type-I
interferon signaling pathway [15]. ORF6 protein with lysosomal targeting motif (YSEL) and diacidic motif (DDEE) induces
intracellular membrane rearrangements resulting in a vesicular population and endosomal internalization of viral protein into

55

the infected cells, increasing replication [16].
ORF7a and ORF7b Proteins:
ORF7a 121 aa coding type I transmembrane protein interacts with SARS-CoV-2 structural proteins M, E, and S, which
are essential for viral assembly, and hence ORF7a is involved in the viral replication cycle and virion-associated ORF7a
protein may function during early infection that has 85.2% Sequence identity with SARS-CoV ORF7a protein and has 97.5%

60

sequence identity, with BatCoV Ratg13 ORF7a protein[5] (Fig.3).

function during early infection [17, 18]. ORF7a leads the activation of pro-inflammatory cytokines and chemokines, such as
IL-8 and RANTES [5]. SARS-CoV ORF7a in combination with E protein activate apoptosis by suppressing anti-apoptotic
65

protein [6]. ORF7b is a 43 aa coding protein found in association with intracellular virus particles and also in purified virions
inside the Golgi compartment that has an 85.4% sequence identity with SARS-CoV ORF7b protein and has 97.6% sequence
identity, with BatCoV Ratg13 ORF7a protein [5] (Fig.4).

ORF7b is found in association with intracellular virus particles and also in purified virions. Till date, there is very little
experimental evidence to support a role for ORF7a or ORF7b in the replication of SARS-CoV-2 [19].
70

ORF8 Protein: ORF8 (121 aa long) is a unique accessory protein in SARS-CoV-2, and it stands out by being poorly
conserved among other CoVs and accordingly showing structural changes suggested to be related to the ability of the virus to
spread [20]. ORF8 is a unique accessory protein in SARS-CoV-2, which stands out by being poorly conserved among other
CoVs and accordingly showing structural changes suggested to be related to the ability of the virus to spread [20]. ORF8
sequences of SARS-CoV-2 and Ratg13 share 95% amino acid identity (Fig.5).

75

ORF8 of SARS-CoV-2 interacts with major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class-I molecules and down-regulates their
surface expression significantly on various cell types [21]. It has been reported earlier that inhibition of ORF8 function could
be a strategy to improve the special immune surveillance and accelerate the eradication of SARS-CoV-2 in vivo [22].
ORF10 Protein: The accessory protein 38 aa coding protein ORF10 has been reported to be unique for SARS-CoV-2
containing eleven cytotoxic T lymphocyte (CTL) epitopes of nine amino acids in length each, across various human leukocyte

80

antigen (HLA) subtypes [23, 24]. ORF10 negatively affects the antiviral protein degradation process through its interaction

ORF10 has 97.3% sequence identity [25] (Fig.6).

2.1. Evaluating the per-residue predisposition of SARS-CoV-2 accessory proteins and their natural variants for intrinsic
95

disorder
Per-residue disorder distribution within the amino acid sequences of SARS-CoV-2 accessory proteins ORF3a, ORF6,
ORF7a, ORF7b, ORF8 and ORF10 and their natural variants was evaluated by PONDR® VSL2, which is one of the more
accurate standalone disorder predictors [26, 27, 28, 29]. The per-residue disorder predisposition scores are on a scale from 0
to 1, where values of 0 indicate fully ordered residues, and values of 1 indicate fully disordered residues. Values above the

100

threshold of 0.5 are considered disordered residues, whereas residues with disorder scores between 0.25 and 0.5 are considered
highly flexible, and residues with disorder scores between 0.1 and 0.25 are taken as moderately flexible.

3. Results
For every continent, the total number of accessory proteins and the total number of unique sequences with respective
percentages are presented in Fig.7. In summary for all six continents, the total number of unique accessory proteins ORF3a,
105

ORF6, ORF7a, ORF7b, ORF8, and ORF10 sequences are 419, 55, 122, 26, 147, and 32, respectively (Supplementary Fig.11).
Furthermore, the percentage of unique sequences on each continent among all available accessory proteins are also enumerated
(Fig.7).

Figure 8: Bar representations of percentages of continental variations (A), and the percentage of unique accessory proteins (B).

From the Fig.8, the following observations were drawn:
110

Across all continents, the decreasing order of percentage of unique variations in the accessory proteins was observed as
follows ORF3a>ORF8>ORF7a>ORF6>ORF10>ORF7b. The highest and lowest unique variations of ORF3a were observed
in South America and Oceania, respectively. In addition, the highest percentage (statistically significant) of unique variations
in each accessory protein was observed in South America. The lowest percentage of unique variations among ORF3a, ORF6,
ORF7b, and ORF8 was observed in Oceania. It is worth noticing that the least number of unique variations in ORF7b and

115

ORF7a was seen in North America and Europe, respectively. It is further noted that in Europe, the lowest variations among
all accessory proteins was found in ORF7a. The smallest percentage of unique ORF10 variations was found in Oceania. With
regards to the total unique variations across all accessory proteins of SARS-CoV-2, the decreasing order would be in South
America>Asia>Europe>Africa>North America>Oceania. ORF3a possessed the highest amount (significantly) of unique
variations across all the six continents while ORF10 showed the lowest variations in Africa, Asia, and Oceania. The lowest

120

unique variations of ORF7b were observed in North America and South America.
In addition, the percentage of unique accessory proteins among all unique sequences obtained across the six continents
are represented as bar diagrams in Fig.9.

Among all available unique variation of the six accessory proteins of SARS-CoV-2, North America and South America
exhibited the highest and lowest percentage of variations of each accessory protein, respectively. The smallest number of
unique variations of ORF3a, ORF6, and ORF10 were noticed in Africa. On the other hand, South America showed the
lowest number of unique ORF6, ORF7a, ORF7b, and ORF8. With regards to ORF7b, the highest number of unique
variations compared to the rest of the accessory proteins, were observed in Africa, Asia, and Oceania. Furthermore, the

130

highest percentage (84.35%) and lowest (0.82%) of unique varieties of ORF8 and ORF7a (among all accessory proteins) was
found in North America and Europe, respectively.
Following continent-wise, lists of identical sequences for each accessory protein were presented (Fig.10).

with ORF3a (YP 009724391) from Wuhan, China. The other sequence S5 is different from ORF3a (YP 009724391) by one
missense mutation Q57H, which was a strain determining mutation [30]. It is found that the ORF3a sequence S54 (Asia:
QKK14624) possesses the single T175I mutation and is present on all continents except in Africa. The ORF3a sequences S62

140

(Asia: QMJ01306) and S63 (Asia: QJQ04482) possessed a single mutation each G251V and G196V, respectively with respect
to Wuhan ORF3a (YP 009724391). These two sequences were present in Asia, Europe, North America, Oceania, and South
America. The ORF3a sequence S4 (Africa: QLQ87565) has the single S171L mutation found on four continents excluding
Europe and Oceania. Besides, two mutations Q57H and D155Y in sequence S34 (Asia) were present only on three continents,
Asia, Europe, and North America. Sequence S53 (Asia) with the G172C mutation has been found in Asia, Europe and North

145

America only. The deletion mutation V255 occurred in S59 (Asia), which was found in Asia, Oceania, and South America.
S68 (Asia) and S69 (Asia) possessed two mutations, H93Y and K67N, respectively. These two ORF3a variants have been
detected only on three continents, Asia, North America, and Oceania. The ORF3a sequence S103 containing the single T229I
mutation is present only on three continents, Europe, North America, and Oceania. Another sequence, S104, with the P240L
mutation has been noticed only in Europe, North America, and South America. The V13L mutation was found in the S122

150

(ORF3a, North America) and is present on three continents, Oceania, North America, and South America. Further, there
were 57 unique ORF3a variants detected only on two continents as listed in Table 3:

The following observations were made based on Table 6.
The amount total dispersions (based on range) of the percentage of IPD and MW of ORF6 variants turned out to be
highest whereas the highest amount of total dispersion of IP was observed for ORF10. The smallest amount of total dispersions
200

of the percentage of IPD, MW, and IP were found for ORF3a, ORF10, and ORF7b, respectively. The large value of range
and variance of the MW of the unique ORF3a, ORF7a, ORF8, and ORF10 variants imply the wide variability of each set
of ORF3a, ORF7a, ORF8, and ORF10 though range and variance of IPD and IP were not much widely spread. In case of
unique variance of ORF6, the range and variance of MW and percentage of IPD were found to be large which implied the
wide quantitative differences among the unique ORF6 variants. Furthermore, moderately high range and variance associated

205

with the percentage of IPD and MW of ORF7a variants imply its moderate variability.
In line with the previously reported data, Fig.14 and Table 6 show that all SARS-CoV-2 accessory proteins contain different
levels of intrinsic disorder. Furthermore, this analysis revealed that intrinsic disorder predispositions can vary significantly
between the natural variants of each individual accessory protein. Importantly, the largest mutation-induced variability
is observed within the disordered or flexible regions of these proteins (i.e., regions characterized by the predicted disorder

210

scores exceeding the 0.5 threshold and regions with disorder scores between 0.25 and 0.5). This is an important observation
suggesting that natural variability of SARS-CoV-2 accessory proteins is shaping their structural flexibility.

4. Discussion
SARS-CoV-2 is the first HuCoVs with pandemic capacity due to its highly contagious nature deriving from the structural
differences in its spike protein such as flat sialic acid binding domain, tight binding to its entry ACE2 receptor and capacity
215

to be cleaved by furin protease [31]. However, based on the estimated infection number close to one billion by WHO, SARSCoV-2 highly contagious but relatively a weak viral pathogen considering the overall of infection number has severe infections
associated with the multiple organ dysfunctions [6]. This relatively weak pathological feature of SARS-CoV-2 could be related
to the accessory proteins modulating host immunity as described above.
Based on the dynamic and various mutations on accessory protein variants, SARS-CoV-2 after diverging with BatCoV

220

Ratg13 19 to 89 years ago was likely to have very few infections or somehow had very few selective pressure to tackle host
immunity in nature [2]. In SARS-CoV-2 as other CoVs the genomic stability of their relatively large RNA genome around
30,000 amino acids is protected with proofreading proteins majorly 3’-5’ exonuclease non-structural protein (nsp)14 and 205
cofactor proteins nsp10, nsp13, and nsp16 [32]. Muller’s ratchet or also called as rachet effect explains the extinctive effect of
high mutation rates of asexual organisms such as viruses [33]. Therefore, SARS-CoV-2 is repairing its mutations to preserve

225

its genomic stability since a mutation can lead to pathological fitness losses or viral extinction [33]. However, there is a
balance governed by genomic repair mechanisms such as nsp14 and viruses that require a certain degree of mutations to
gain novel traits such as emergence transmission in zoonotic hosts [33]. For instance, SARS-CoV mutations, a 29-nucleotide
deletion of ORF8, was associated with the less pathogenic strain [33]. Similarly, SARS-CoV-2 variants with a 382-nucleotide
deletion, ORF8 had mild symptoms and did not require supplemental oxygen [33].

230

Furthermore, only one variant (identical to the Wuhan sequence (NC 045512) of each of the accessory proteins of ORF6,
ORF7a, ORF7b, and ORF10 were present on all continents. Furthermore, it was observed that only two variants of ORF3a
differed by a single mutation (Q57H, a clade/strain determining [30]) were found on all six continents. Also, in ORF8, only
two unique variants (differed by a strain determining single mutation L84S) appeared on all continents. So, the maximally
intersecting family of variations across all accessory proteins has turned out to be the smallest. These findings confirmed that

235

the other variants of all the accessory proteins were due to demographic, environmental constraints.
It was found that most of the unique variants of accessory proteins differed from the respective Wuhan accessory proteins
by a single mutation, although basic descriptive statistics as found in section 3.1, unfolded their respective wide variability.
Note that new variants of each accessory protein have been found in recent days and continue to do so. Significant amounts
of unique variants of each accessory protein having wide variability might contribute significantly to the pathogenicity of

240

SARS-CoV-2.
Therefore, our firm conviction that natural weakened stability (if achievable) of SARS-CoV-2 seems to be a far reachable
destiny that alarms the danger of the present pandemic scenario due to COVID-19. Also, unique accessory protein variants
across individual continents would all be expected to be mixed, while international travels would be restarted without strict
protective measures. In this regard, it is our (SACRED, Self-Assembled COVID-19 Research & Education Directive”, con-

245

sisting of international experts in mathematics, physics, computer science, bioinformatics, nanotechnology, structural biology,
molecular biology, immunology, and virology) strong recommendation to governmental and non-governmental administrations
to take necessary measures to mitigate the spread of COVID-19.
