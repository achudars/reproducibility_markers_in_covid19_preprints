ABSTRACT
The high transmissibility of SARS-CoV-2 is related to abundant replication in the upper
airways, which is not observed for the other highly pathogenic coronaviruses SARS-CoV-1 and
MERS-CoV. We here reveal features of the coronavirus spike (S) protein, which optimize the
virus towards different parts of the respiratory tract. First, the SARS-CoV-2 spike (SARS-2-S)
reached higher levels in pseudoparticles when produced at 33°C instead of 37°C. Even
stronger preference for the upper airway temperature of 33°C was evident for the S protein of
HCoV-229E, a common cold coronavirus. In contrast, the S proteins of SARS-CoV-1 and
MERS-CoV favored 37°C, in accordance with their preference for the lower airways. Next,
SARS-2-S proved efficiently activated by TMPRSS13, besides the previously identified host
cell protease TMPRSS2, which may broaden the cell tropism of SARS-CoV-2. TMPRSS13
was found to be an effective spike activator for the virulent coronaviruses but not the common
cold HCoV-229E virus. Activation by these proteases requires pre-cleavage of the SARS-2-S
S1/S2 cleavage loop, and both its furin motif and extended loop length proved critical to
achieve virus entry into airway epithelial cells. Finally, we show that the D614G mutation in
SARS-2-S increases S protein stability and expression at 37°C, and promotes virus entry via
cathepsin B/L activation. These spike properties might promote virus spread, potentially
explaining why the G614 variant is currently predominating worldwide. Collectively, our
findings indicate how the coronavirus spike protein is fine-tuned towards the temperature and
protease conditions of the airways, to enhance virus transmission and pathology.

SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT
The rapid spread of SARS-CoV-2, the cause of COVID-19, is related to abundant replication
in the upper airways, which is not observed for other highly pathogenic human coronaviruses.
We here reveal features of the coronavirus spike (S) protein, which optimize the virus towards
different parts of the respiratory tract. Coronavirus spikes exhibit distinct temperature
preference to precisely match the upper (~33°C) or lower (37°C) airways. We identified airway
proteases that activate the spike for virus entry into cells, including one protease that may
mediate coronavirus virulence. Also, a link was seen between spike stability and entry via
endosomal proteases. This mechanism of spike fine-tuning could explain why the SARS-CoV2 spike-D614G mutant is more transmissible and therefore globally predominant.

INTRODUCTION
The devastating COVID-19 pandemic is caused by the novel bat-derived SARS-CoV-2 virus.
Despite its recent introduction in humans, this coronavirus (CoV) is already very well adapted
for efficient respiratory droplet transmission and high-titer replication in human airways (1, 2).
Its disease spectrum varies from mild respiratory symptoms to severe pneumonia (3),
depending mostly on the patient’s age and comorbidities. The SARS-CoV-2 pandemic was
preceded by local outbreaks of SARS-CoV-1 and MERS-CoV, two other highly virulent viruses
with a bat origin (4, 5). Compared to SARS-CoV-2, SARS-CoV-1 and MERS-CoV have far
lower tropism for the upper respiratory tract (1, 6). In contrast, a mild common cold-like disease
is typical for the endemic human CoVs 229E, NL63, OC43 and HKU1 (7). Their zoonotic
spillover probably occurred long time ago (8-10), implying extensive adaptation to the upper
respiratory tract in which these common cold viruses are flourishing.
CoV replication in the upper or lower airways implicates that the virus is compatible with the
temperature in these compartments, which evolves from ~30-32°C in the nose to 37°C in the
deeper airways (11, 12). We recently showed that the hemagglutinin of influenza B virus has
an intrinsic preference for 33°C to be robustly expressed, consistent with 33°C being the best
temperature to propagate this virus. Other temperature profiles were recognized for the
hemagglutinin proteins of human and avian influenza A viruses (13). This subtle adaptation of
viral glycoproteins to the temperature in the host organs might also apply to other respiratory
viruses with a zoonotic origin, in particular CoVs. Since SARS-CoV-2 exhibits abundant
replication in the nose (14), it is conceivable that its spike (S) glycoprotein (SARS-2-S) is finetuned towards this cooler compartment.
The trimeric spike protein mediates CoV entry into the host cell. Its S1 domain is responsible
for receptor binding, while the S2 domain mediates fusion between the viral envelope and a
cellular membrane (15). To become membrane fusion-competent, the full-length spike protein
(S0) needs to be cleaved by host cell proteases at its S1/S2 and S2' sites (16, 17). Cleavage
at the S2' site might be sufficient to trigger membrane fusion and is subsequently referred to
as activation, since it releases the internal fusion peptide (18). The host protease TMPRSS2
is a prominent player in S2' activation, however also other proteases may be involved, thus
broadening the cell or tissue tropism of SARS-CoV-2. TMPRSS2 knockout was shown to
reduce lung pathology in mouse models for SARS and MERS (19). Still, the finding that virus
replication was slower but not abolished, suggests that activation can be performed by
additional proteases. The Type II Transmembrane Serine Protease (TTSP) family, to which
TMPRSS2 belongs, contains in total 18 proteases, many of which are expressed in human
airways (13). Only a limited number have been investigated in the CoV context [reviewed in:
(16)]. Precise knowledge of the activating TTSPs would help to conceive host-directed
therapies interfering with spike activation (20).
One noticeable feature of the SARS-CoV-2 spike is the presence of an extended S1/S2
cleavage loop bearing a multibasic furin recognition motif (RRAR) (21). This loop extension is
the result of a four-amino acid-insertion not present in the S protein of the probable bat
ancestor virus (22). Pre-cleavage of the multibasic motif is assumedly performed by furin-like
proteases (23-26), but also other proteases have been proposed (27). S1/S2 pre-cleavage
proved crucial for subsequent SARS-2-S activation by TMPRSS2 and for viral entry into airway
epithelial Calu-3 cells (24). The furin dependence also applies to the S protein of MERS-CoV
(MERS-S) (28, 29), but not the spike protein of SARS-CoV-1 (SARS-1-S) (24). On the other
hand, all three aforementioned CoV S proteins do not need S1/S2 pre-cleavage to mediate
entry into cells expressing the endo/lysosomal protease cathepsin B/L, which activates the S

protein after virus uptake by endocytosis (18, 25). For SARS-2-S, the determinants governing
cleavage of its extended S1/S2 loop are still far from clear. In addition, SARS-CoV-2 passaging
in Vero cells commonly leads to substitutions or deletions in the S1/S2 cleavage loop (30-36).
In animal models, these viruses exhibit reduced transmission (37) or virulence (38). Mutant
viruses bearing substitutions or deletions in the S1/S2 loop are rarely detected in humans (33,
37, 39) (Suppl. Tables S1 and S2).
Within a few months circulation among humans, SARS-CoV-2 has acquired a mutation
(D614G) in its spike protein, that is increasingly recognized as a possible cause of enhanced
virus transmission (40-42). The D614G mutation was already detected during the early phase
of the pandemic and, after four months, the SG614 variant became globally predominant (43).
Compared to SARS-CoV-2-SD614 virus, the SG614 variant exhibits higher transmissibility in
animal models (40-42). The D614G mutation was also shown to enhance SARS-CoV-2
replication (40-42) and increase infectivity of SARS-2-S-bearing pseudoparticles (40, 42, 4447). Hence, both the D614G mutation and S1/S2 cleavage loop deletions appear to alter virus
transmissibility, but the underlying mechanisms remain enigmatic.
The aim of this study was to assess how SARS-2-S is fine-tuned towards the temperature and
proteases of the airways; and how these properties compare to those of SARS-1-S, MERS-S
and the S protein of the common cold virus HCoV-229E. By performing pseudovirus production
at 33°C and 37°C, we revealed that each spike protein exhibits an intrinsic and distinct
temperature preference, correlating with viral preference for the upper or lower airways. We
next addressed how SARS-2-S driven entry is controlled by host proteases that cleave its
extended S1/S2 loop or S2' site. Hence, we studied the entry behavior of different SARS-2-S
loop deletion mutants, and we assessed which of the 18 human TTSPs act as CoV spike
activators. Finally, we investigated the temperature and protease dependency of the SARS-2S D614G mutant, to appreciate how these spike features might be linked to virus
transmissibility.

RESULTS
The spikes of SARS-CoV-2 and HCoV-229E prefer 33°C for pseudoparticle production,
while the SARS-CoV-1 spike prefers 37°C
The temperature gradient in the human respiratory tract is a plausible key factor in determining
whether a virus preferentially replicates in the upper or lower airways. We observed that the
common cold virus HCoV-229E replicates more efficiently at 33°C and 35°C, when compared
to 37°C and, particularly, 39°C (Suppl. Fig. 1). Similarly, SARS-CoV-2 was reported to prefer
33°C to 37°C, while SARS-CoV-1 showed the opposite profile (48).
We hypothesized that CoV S proteins may exhibit temperature dependency, in relation to the
temperature required for optimal virus replication. To study this, we produced MLV particles
bearing the S proteins of the highly pathogenic SARS-CoV-1 (SARS-1-S), SARS-CoV-2
(SARS-2-S) and MERS-CoV (MERS-S) or the common cold virus HCoV-229E (229E-S) (Fig.
1A). Immunoblot analysis of pseudoparticles produced at 33°C or 37°C revealed that
temperature impacted particle incorporation of these S proteins, but not S protein cleavage by
host cell proteases. Thus, particle incorporation of SARS-2-SD614 was 1.9-fold (P=0.027) higher
at 33°C than at 37°C (Fig. 1B). This effect was even more pronounced for 229E-S (= 10-fold
higher level at 33°C than at 37°C; P=0.0027), which was barely incorporated at 37°C. The
picture was entirely opposite for SARS-1-S, where particle incorporation was 2.7-fold higher
at 37°C than at 33°C (P=0.0047) and a similar trend was observed for MERS-S.
Importantly, for each virus, the temperature preference was equally apparent when we
determined particle infectivity by transducing HEK293T cells transfected with TMPRSS2 and
the appropriate receptor [i.e. human ACE2 for SARS-CoV-1 and SARS-CoV-2; human
dipeptidyl peptidase-4 (DPP4) for MERS-CoV; and human aminopeptidase N (APN) for HCoV229E] (Fig. 1C). Pseudoparticles produced at 33°C harboured more SARS-2-S and 229E-S
and showed higher infectivity as compared to their counterparts produced at 37°C, and the
reverse effect was observed for particles bearing SARS-1-S or MERS-S. For each
pseudovirus, the signal was the same whether virus entry (i.e. target cell transduction) was
performed at 33°C or 37°C (data not shown).
Collectively, these results indicate that CoV S protein appearance in virus particles is
temperature-dependent, in relation to the temperature required for optimal virus replication.
The SARS-2-SD614 protein prefers 33°C to 37°C, a property that is still more pronounced for
229E-S. On the contrary, 37°C is the preferred temperature for MERS-S and especially SARS1-S.
Generation of S-pseudoviruses with wild-type and mutant spikes and mRNA expression
analysis of target cells
To investigate the determinants and impact of S1/S2 pre-cleavage in SARS-2-S (Fig. 2A), we
generated pseudoviruses with wild-type (WT) SARS-2-SD614 and three deletion mutants
missing parts of the extended S1/S2 cleavage loop (Fig. 2B and 2C). The ΔPRRA mutant lacks
the furin cleavage motif (RRAR) and its cleavage site is identical to that of the SARS-CoV-2related bat CoV RaTG13 (22). The ΔQTQTN mutant lacks a sequence preceding the RRAR
motif, while mutant ΔNSPRRAR lacks the RRAR motif plus three flanking amino acid residues.
These or very similar deletions are commonly detected during passaging of SARS-CoV-2 in
Vero cells (see Suppl. Table S3 and references therein), suggesting that they might confer a
growth advantage in this cell line. For comparison, we introduced the multibasic cleavage site

of SARS-2-S and its preceding residues into SARS-1-S, and we generated a MERS-S mutant
in which the furin motif was destroyed (R748C). Besides these S1/S2 loop mutants, we
produced the D614G mutant form of SARS-2-S, to investigate the possible mechanism behind
the shift from the early SD614 to currently predominating SG614 variant virus (43). Residue 614 is
located at an inter-protomer interface in the spike trimer (Fig. 2C) (44, 45).
Before conducting pseudovirus entry studies, we performed RT-qPCR analysis to estimate
expression of relevant host cell factors in the three cell lines under study, namely human airway
epithelial Calu-3 cells; African green monkey kidney Vero E6 cells; and human embryonic
kidney HEK293T cells. Human nasal and lung tissue samples were included for comparison
(Fig. 3A). Respiratory tissue contained the transcripts for three CoV receptors [i.e. ACE2, the
entry receptor for SARS-CoV-1 and SARS-CoV-2; DPP4, the receptor for MERS-CoV; and
APN, the HCoV-229E receptor], and the mRNA levels were comparable for the two anatomic
sites. ACE2 and DPP4, but not ANPEP/APN, were expressed in the three cell lines. Human
nasal and lung tissue samples contained abundant mRNA levels for CTSB (cathepsin B) and
intermediate levels for CTSL (cathepsin L). CTSB mRNA was also present in Vero E6 and
HEK293T cells, and at lower levels in Calu-3 cells. The transcript levels of CTSL (cathepsin L)
proved very high in Vero E6 cells, intermediate in HEK293T cells, and lower in Calu-3 cells, as
described by others (28, 49). Finally, all samples contained quite comparable levels of furin
mRNA, except for those of Calu-3, which were slightly lower. As reported by us before (13),
Calu-3 cells show high expression of TMPRSS2 and several other TTSPs, at levels
comparable to those found in primary respiratory tissue. To conclude, Calu-3 cells are suitable
to assess viral entry via TMPRSS2 and other TTSPs, while Vero E6 cells are useful to study
cathepsin B/L-mediated entry. HEK293T cells are suited for ectopic expression of receptors or
proteases.
Cleavage of the SARS-2-S S1/S2 site is determined by the multibasic motif as well as
the length of the cleavage loop
First, we examined processing of S0 into S1/S2, in HEK293T cells transfected with the WT
and mutant S protein forms (Fig. 3B). The presence of a C-terminal V5-tag in the S proteins
enabled western blot analysis with an anti-V5 antibody. The D614- and G614-forms of SARS2-S showed a strong S2 band, indicating equally efficient S1/S2 cleavage by one or more
proteases expressed in these cells (23-26). All three SARS-2-SD614 mutants bearing deletions
in the S1/S2 loop showed virtually abrogated cleavage. The lack of cleavage for the ΔQTQTN
mutant (which still possesses the multibasic furin motif but lacks preceding amino acids)
indicates that not only the furin motif itself is critical for cleavage, but also the length of the loop
presenting this motif. As expected (29), also WT MERS-S was efficiently cleaved, while its
monobasic (monoR) cleavage site mutant was not processed. In contrast, SARS-1-S WT was
barely cleaved, while proteolytic processing was efficient for the mutant containing the
extended (Ext) S1/S2 cleavage loop of SARS-2-S, as anticipated (24).
Loop deletion mutants of SARS-2-S show enhanced cathepsin-dependent entry,
explaining their emergence in Vero cells
To evaluate how S1/S2 pre-cleavage impacts viral entry into Calu-3 or Vero E6 cells, we used
WT and mutant pseudoviruses, produced at the optimal temperature established in the first
part of this study. To fully discriminate the two S protein activation pathways, we included the
protease inhibitors camostat and E64d (Fig. 4A). All three SARS-2-SD614 mutants bearing

deletions in the S1/S2 cleavage loop showed markedly reduced (6- to 30-fold; P ≤ 0.009 versus
WT) entry into Calu-3 cells (Fig. 4B, top left panel), in keeping with expectations (24). Entry
was fully rescued when exogenous trypsin was added during Calu-3 cell transduction (Suppl.
Fig. S2), indicating that the poor entry was due to a lack of S2' cleavage by TTSPs, and not to
inefficient receptor binding. Conversely, these three SARS-2-S loop deletion mutations
resulted in 13- to 20-fold higher entry into Vero E6 cells, which depends on cathepsin L (Fig.
4B, top right panel). This explains why SARS-CoV-2 passaging in Vero E6 cells regularly leads
to emergence of viruses bearing substitutions or deletions in the S1/S2 loop (30-36). For the
SARS-1-S and MERS-S mutants, the data concurred with other reports. Namely, Calu-3 cell
entry of SARS-1-S pseudovirus was unchanged when its S1/S2 sequence was exchanged for
the extended loop of SARS-2-S, including the multibasic motif (24). Akin to SARS-2-S, mutant
MERS-S pseudovirus bearing a monobasic (= non furin-cleavable) S1/S2 site showed
dramatically reduced (71-fold) Calu-3 cell entry (28). On the other hand, entry into Vero E6
cells was more efficient (4-fold, P < 0.0001) for SARS-1-S-pseudovirus with WT protein (=
short monobasic S1/S2 loop) than the mutant with extended multibasic loop. However, the
opposite was seen for MERS-S, namely higher entry (3-fold; P = 0.0006) for WT (= furincleavable) than mutant (= monobasic) pseudovirus.
Camostat produced >80% inhibition of Calu-3 cell entry (Fig. 4B, middle left panel),
corroborating that virus entry into these cells relies on serine proteases like TMPRSS2 (50).
E64d (Fig. 4B, bottom left panel) had a small effect on the WT SARS-2-S particles but a 2-fold
higher effect on the loop mutants, indicating that even in Calu-3 cells, the cathepsin route gets
a boost when the pseudoparticles are not cleaved at S1/S2. In contrast, for all pseudoviruses,
Vero E6 cell entry was highly sensitive (59-95% inhibition) to E64d but not camostat (Fig. 4B),
confirming that S protein-driven entry into these cells is highly cathepsin L-dependent (16, 50,
51).
In summary, these results underline the previously proposed concept (23-26, 28) that SARS2-S and MERS-S, but not SARS-1-S, require S1/S2 pre-cleavage in producer cells for
subsequent TMPRSS2-dependent entry into Calu-3 cells. More importantly, we demonstrate
that, for SARS-2-S, not only the integrity of the furin motif at the S1/S2 site but also the length
of the loop harboring this cleavage site, are required to enable S1/S2 pre-cleavage. Mutants
that cannot undergo this processing are boosted towards cathepsin B/L-mediated entry,
explaining why substitutions or deletions in the S1/S2 cleavage loop commonly emerge during
SARS-CoV-2 propagation in Vero E6 cells.
Among all 18 TTSPs, TMPRSS2 and TMPRSS13 are the best activators of SARS-2-S
We next asked whether, besides TMPRSS2, other TTSPs can activate SARS-2-S for virus
entry. The pseudoviruses were applied to TTSP- plus receptor-transfected HEK293T cells in
the presence of E64d, to shut off the parallel cathepsin route (Fig. 5A). We first investigated
activation of SARS-2-S by the 18 known human TTSPs or by furin (Fig. 5B). The most efficient
activator was TMPRSS2, followed by TMPRSS13 that was only 3-fold less effective. Human
airway trypsin-like protease (HAT) and furin were, respectively, 19- and 14-fold less active than
TMPRSS2. Mutating the S1/S2 cleavage loop abrogated activation by TMPRSS2,
TMPRSS13, HAT and furin (Fig. 5C), in accordance with the inability of these S proteins to
mediate robust virus entry into Calu-3 cells. Next, we addressed whether these four proteases
activate SARS-1-S, MERS-S and 229E-S (Fig. 5D). TMPRSS2 activated the S proteins of all
four CoVs, in keeping with published data (50, 52-58). Intriguingly, TMPRSS13 enhanced entry
driven by the S proteins of the highly virulent SARS-CoV-1, SARS-CoV-2 and MERS-CoV, but

not the common cold virus HCoV-229E. MERS-S and 229E-S were both activated by HAT,
with roughly the same efficiency as TMPRSS2. HAT proved effective on 229E-S and MERSS, as reported earlier (56, 59). Finally, furin expression in the target cells gave weak activation
of the four S proteins, which aligns with the report that extracellular furin can act at the stage
of MERS-CoV entry (29). S1/S2 pre-cleavage was required for efficient TTSP activation of
SARS-2-S and MERS-S, as evident from the much lower activation of the S1/S2 mutants
compared to the WT (Fig. 5C and 5D). This effect may only apply to S proteins that naturally
have a pre-cleavable S1/S2 site, since SARS-1-S showed equal activation by TTSPs whether
it was or was not pre-cleaved (compare WT and Ext mutant in Fig. 5D).
To summarize, these results corroborate TMPRSS2 as an efficient and broad S protein
activator, and identify TMPRSS13 as a novel activator of highly pathogenic CoVs.
The D614G change increases SARS-CoV-2 spike stability, reduces its reliance on 33°C
and boosts entry via the cathepsin route
Finally, we investigated the impact of the D614G mutation on the temperature and protease
dependency of the SARS-2-S protein. We first assessed pseudovirion thermostability, since
one study indicated that the D614G mutation generates a more stable trimeric spike protein by
removing a destabilizing inter-protomer interaction (44, 45). Also, since the SD614 protein may
more easily shed the S1 subunit (45), we included our SARS-2-S mutants bearing unprimed
spikes due to S1/S2 loop deletions. Finally, we included the SARS-1-S, MERS-S and 229E-S
pseudovirions. In order to assess S protein stability, these different pseudotypes were
incubated for 1 h at varying temperatures (range: 33 to 41°C, and 4°C for the control) and then
tested for infectivity in HEK293T cells expressing receptor and TMPRSS2 (Fig. 6A). SARS-2SD614 had comparable stability as SARS-1-S and 229E-S, while MERS-S appeared slightly
more stable (Fig. 6B). On the other hand, the thermostability of SARS-2-SD614 was markedly
increased when it was not pre-cleaved at S1/S2 (see the three loop deletion mutants in Fig.
6C). Importantly, the same stabilizing effect was achieved by introducing the D614G
substitution (Fig. 6C).
Secondly, the SARS-2-SG614 variant was less dependent on 33°C to achieve high protein levels
in released pseudovirions (Fig. 6D). The level of the SG614 protein was not significantly higher
when the particles were produced at 33°C instead of 37°C, while SD614 reached a significantly
(P=0.0002) higher level at 33°C (Fig. 6D). The two variants showed no difference in terms of
S1/S2 cleavage efficiency, and both generated pseudovirions with fully S1/S2 pre-cleaved
spikes. This contradicts another study (46) but agrees with three other reports (40, 42, 44).
Last but not least, compared to SD614, SG614 pseudovirus showed superior entry into Calu-3 and
Vero E6 cells (Fig. 6E). The enhancement was particularly prominent in Vero E6 cells,
suggesting that the D614G mutation mainly promotes cathepsin B/L-dependent entry. In line
with this, the SG614 pseudovirus proved independent of TTSP activation to enter into HEK293T
cells. Compared to SD614 pseudovirus, it entered 3- to 5-fold more efficiently, but this gain was
similar whether the cells were transfected with a TTSP-expression or empty plasmid (Fig. 6F).
To conclude, our results indicate that the D614G mutation generates a more stable SARS-2S protein, which might offer the SG614 variant a growth advantage. The mutation causes a shift
towards cathepsin-mediated entry and reduces the spike’s reliance on 33°C to achieve high S
protein levels in pseudoparticles.

DISCUSSION
In this study, we recognized two features of the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein, i.e. compatibility
with the varying temperature in the human respiratory tract and a well-tuned protease
activation mechanism, which may well be two determinants for the high transmissibility and
virulence of this virus. Our approach to include pseudoviruses with the spikes of SARS-CoV1, MERS-CoV and HCoV-229E, offered the possibility to notice analogies and interpret our
findings from a broader perspective.
First of all, we unveiled a distinct temperature preference for these different CoV spike proteins,
that precisely matches the predilection of each virus for the upper or lower respiratory tract.
SARS-CoV-2, but not SARS-CoV-1, replicates abundantly in the nose (~30-32°C) and upper
airways (1, 2), a driving factor behind its efficient transmission. Both viruses, as well as MERSCoV, also replicate in the lungs (37°C) to produce severe pathology. Intriguingly, we found that
SARS-1-S and, to a lesser extent, MERS-S favour 37°C, while SARS-2-S is compatible with
37°C, yet prefers 33°C. This aligns with viral behaviour in cell culture, since SARS-CoV-2, but
not SARS-CoV-1, was shown to prefer 33°C to 37°C (48). We observed the same for the
common cold HCoV-229E, which prefers a cooler temperature for virus replication and for
which 37°C proved detrimental when generating pseudoparticles bearing its spike. This airway
temperature preference is a property of the coronavirus spike glycoprotein, but also the
influenza virus hemagglutinin (13), suggesting that it might be a commonality for human
respiratory viruses. As to the biochemical basis, a cooler temperature likely ensures lower
conformational flexibility during S glycoprotein synthesis or transport (60), and avoidance of
unstable spike conformers. For SARS-2-S, the 33°C preference proved more pronounced for
the SD614 than the SG614 variant. The SD614 form may require 33°C for productive folding and
transport, while the SG614 protein appears less demanding thanks to its higher stability, as
evident from our thermostability analysis. Our findings generated with pseudotyped virus are
supported by data with authentic viruses, since the SARS-CoV-2-SD614 and -SG614 variants
exhibited comparable replication in human nasal cells at 33°C, but the SG614 variant reached
higher titers in bronchial epithelial cells at 37°C and 39°C (41).
Secondly, we revealed which of the 18 human TTSPs, of which many are present in human
respiratory tissue (13), can activate SARS-2-S for virus entry. We confirmed that TMPRSS2 is
an efficient and broad CoV spike activator. HAT proved effective on 229E-S and MERS-S,
however it was less active on SARS-1-S and SARS-2-S, as reported earlier (54, 56, 59,
61).The most intriguing result regards TMPRSS13, which we identified as a second potent
activator of SARS-1-S, SARS-2-S and MERS-S, but not 229E-S. Since this protease prefers
cleavage sites with a second basic residue at positions P2 or P4 (62), it plausibly recognizes
the S2ʹ site at the KR motif of SARS-1-S and SARS-2-S, and the RSAR motif of MERS-S.
Such a motif is missing in the predicted S2ʹ sites of all common cold CoVs (21). This raises
the hypothesis that TMPRSS13 cleavability might be a CoV virulence factor, in line with the
observation that this protease activates the hemagglutinin of some highly pathogenic avian
influenza A viruses (62). TMPRSS13 is highly expressed in different cell types of the human
respiratory tract (61, 63) and is also present in Calu-3 cells (13). It is important to note that
SARS-2-S cleavability by other TTSPs than TMPRSS2 does not compromise clinical
evaluation of camostat against COVID-19 (ClinicalTrials.gov identifiers: NCT04455815,
NCT04321096, NCT04353284, NCT04355052, NCT04374019), since this molecule is a broad
TTSP inhibitor (61).
Thirdly, while SARS-1-S did not need S1/S2 pre-cleavage, this processing proved crucial for
TTSP-activation of SARS-2-S, presumably by provoking a conformational change that

facilitates subsequent S2’ cleavage (24, 28, 64). Our data with SARS-2-S loop mutants show
that the extended loop length and furin motif are equally important to achieve S1/S2
processing. Besides furin (or related proprotein convertases), also cathepsin B/L in the
secretory pathway (65) might possibly perform this pre-cleavage during S protein trafficking or
during viral egress via a recently discovered lysosome-exocytic pathway (66). All three
enzymes were shown to cleave the S1/S2 sequence in an enzymatic assay (27). When
unprimed, SARS-2-S pseudoviruses are strongly boosted towards the cathepsin B/L route.
This likely explains the replication advantage of loop-deletion SARS-CoV-2 mutants in
cathepsin L-rich Vero E6 cells (30-36). Whereas the S1/S2 primed state predisposes to S2ʹ
activation by TTSPs, the non-covalently linked S1/S2 form is less stable and a plausible
disadvantage for endosomal entry. During virus traffic from the cell membrane to late
endosomes [which takes up to 1 h (67)], S1 and S2 must remain associated under gradually
more acidic pH conditions. The S1/S2 loop mutant (= unprimed) virions circumvent this
problem, since they are only cleaved by cathepsins after reaching acidic endosomes. The
superior stability of loop mutants over WT SARS-2-SD614 was also evident in our thermostability
experiments.
Strikingly, also the more stable SG614 variant proved to be boosted for Vero E6 cell entry,
despite being pre-cleaved. Its higher stability concurs with lower S1 shedding (45), a clear
advantage for endosomal entry. Improved stability may be the reason why SARS-CoV-2-SD614
was superseded by the SG614 variant within a few months of circulation in humans (43). Animal
studies showed that the SARS-CoV-2-SG614 variant has higher fitness and transmissibility (4042). This is reminiscent of influenza virus, for which the link between hemagglutinin stability
and transmissibility is well established (13, 68). The relatively low stability of SD614 could be
attributed to an unfavorable interprotomer contact that is not present in SG614 (44, 45). Besides,
the superior cell entry of SG614 pseudovirus, seen in this and several other studies (42-47), was
rationalized by structural evidence that the D614G substitution leads to a more open receptor
binding conformation (44). This can explain increased entry of the SG614 variant via the TTSP
pathway in Calu-3 cells (40, 44). However, we found that this gain was quite modest, while
entry via the endosomal pathway proved much more enhanced. This indicates that the SG614
virus is more effective at using the two entry routes, which may broaden its cell tropism. In cells
lacking appropriate surface proteases, endosomal entry might provide an alternative pathway.
Cathepsin B/L-mediated CoV entry may thus have higher in vivo relevance than often
assumed. Its role might be underestimated when Calu-3 cells are used, since they express low
levels of cathepsin B and cathepsin L. Both cathepsins are expressed at high levels in several
types of airway epithelial cells (69), in line with our analysis on nasal and lung tissue samples.
Of note, endosomal entry exposes the virus to endosomal interferon-induced transmembrane
proteins (IFITMs), which may either act as virus restriction factors (70) or, in sharp contrast,
be hijacked by SARS-CoV-2, as recently demonstrated (71). Here, temperature might again
be a key player, as innate immune activation proved to be greatly diminished at 33°C compared
to 37°C (48, 72). In our experiments, unprimed (= S1/S2 mutant) MERS-S pseudovirus differed
from the SARS-2-S counterparts, in not showing higher entry into Vero E6 cells, which is in
line with another study (28). This might suggest that the MERS spike is particularly sensitive
to IFITM control or highly unstable at endosomal pH. Yet, these hypotheses definitely need
validation with live virus in appropriate human airway models.
To conclude, we revealed mechanisms whereby the coronavirus spike protein is adjusted to
match the temperature and protease conditions of the human airways. This insight will help to
better comprehend coronavirus-host interaction and adaptation, and, in short term, will be
highly valuable to understand the behaviour of emerging spike mutants of SARS-CoV-2.

MATERIALS AND METHODS
Ethics statement
Lung tissue samples from eight different healthy donors and nasal tissue samples from one
healthy donor and one patient with chronic rhinosinusitis with nasal polyps were obtained under
the approval of the ethical committee from the University Hospital Leuven (UZ Leuven
Biobanking S51577 and S59864). All patients were adult and provided written informed
consent.
Cells, media and compounds
Calu-3 (ATCC HTB-55) cells were grown in minimum essential medium (MEM) supplemented
with 10% fetal calf serum (FCS), 0.1 mM non-essential amino acids, 2 mM L-glutamine, and
10 mM HEPES. HEK293T cells (HCL4517; Thermo Fisher Scientific) and Vero E6 (ATCC
CRL-1586) were grown in Dulbecco’s modified Eagle’s medium (DMEM) supplemented with
10% FCS, 1 mM sodium pyruvate, 0.075% sodium bicarbonate and (only for Vero E6) 0.1 mM
non-essential amino acids. Unless stated otherwise, all cell incubations were done at 37°C.
The transduction medium consisted of DMEM supplemented with 2% FCS, 0.1 mM nonessential amino acids, 1 mM sodium pyruvate, 0.075% sodium bicarbonate, 100 U/mL of
penicillin and 0.1 mg/mL of streptomycin. Camostat mesylate was purchased from SigmaAldrich, whereas E64d and chloromethylketone (dec-RVKR-CMK) were from Enzo Life
Sciences.
Analysis of receptor and protease gene expression in cells, and human lung and nasal
tissue
Total RNA was extracted using a ReliaPrep RNA Cell Miniprep System (Promega), and 0.5 µg
of RNA was converted to cDNA with a high-capacity cDNA reverse transcription kit (Thermo
Fisher Scientific). BRYT Green dye-based quantitative PCR (qPCR) was performed with
GoTaq qPCR Master Mix (Promega) and intron-spanning primer pairs (see Suppl. Table S4
for a list of all primers) in an ABI 7500 Fast real-time PCR system (Applied Biosciences).
Expression data were normalized to housekeeping gene ACTB.
Plasmids
The expression plasmids for HAT and DESC1 were reported before (73). The plasmids for the
other 16 TTSPs and furin were purchased from GenScript and described earlier (13). To
express the CoV receptors, we used plasmids encoding human ACE2 (74); human DPP4 (75)
and human APN (56).
The plasmids to express SARS-1-S and MERS-S with a C-terminal V5-tag were already
reported (76, 77). To create the SARS-2-S-V5 expression plasmid, we used a starting plasmid
carrying a codon-optimized SARS-2-S coding sequence (early pandemic D614 variant;
GenBank ID MN908947.3) that was generously provided by K. Dallmeier (Leuven, Belgium)
(78). A C-terminal V5-tag was added and the construct was subcloned into the pCAGGS vector
using the NEBuilder HiFi DNA Assembly kit (New England Biolabs). Likewise, a V5 tag was
introduced into a pCAGGS-based plasmid encoding 229E-S (79). Mutations in the S coding
sequence were introduced via PCR with overlapping primers, and inserted into pCAGGS using
the NEBuilder HiFi DNA Assembly kit. All plasmids were subjected to sequencing analysis to
verify the presence of the desired mutations and absence of any unwanted mutations.
Production of MLV-S pseudoviruses and transduction experiments
The method to produce firefly luciferase (fLuc)-expressing MLV pseudovirus carrying CoV Sprotein, was previously described (80). In brief, HEK293T cells seeded in 6-well plates, were
transfected using Lipofectamine® 2000 (Life Technologies), with a mixture of plasmids

encoding MLV gag-pol, the fLuc reporter and V5-tagged S-protein. At 4 h post transfection, the
medium was replaced by medium with 2% FCS. Pseudoparticle production was done at 33°C
or 37°C, as specified in the Figure legends. At 48 h, the pseudovirus-containing supernatants
were harvested, clarified by centrifugation and stored at -80°C.
For transduction (always performed at 37°C), Calu-3 or Vero E6 cells were seeded in white
96-well plates and one day later exposed to 100 µl virus stock. In the case of HEK293T, the
cells were first transfected with the receptor- and TTSP- expression plasmids, at 24 h before
transduction. In some experiments, protease inhibitors, i.e. camostat mesylate, E64d,
chloromethylketone (all at 50 µM) or 1% DMSO (solvent control), were added at 2 h before
pseudovirus transduction. At 6 h after transduction, pseudovirus and compounds were
removed and fresh medium was added. Three days later, fLuc activity was measured using a
luciferase assay system kit and GloMax® Navigator Microplate Luminometer (both from
Promega).
To assess thermostability of the pseudoparticles, they were incubated for 1 h in tubes, at a
temperature of 33, 35, 37, 39 or 41°C, or at 4°C included as control. They were then transduced
into receptor- and TMPRSS2-transfected HEK293T cells. Two hours later, the transduction
medium was replaced by complete growth medium.
Western blot analysis of S protein expression and incorporation into pseudoparticles
To analyze S protein expression, the plasmids encoding a V5-tagged S protein were
transfected into HEK293T cells, using Lipofectamine® 2000. Four hours later, the medium was
replaced and the cells were incubated for another 48 h. Next, the cells were washed once with
PBS and lysed in RIPA buffer supplemented with protease inhibitor cocktail (both from Thermo
Fisher Scientific). The lysates were boiled for 5 min at 95°C in 1x XT sample buffer containing
1x XT reducing agent (both from Bio-Rad) and resolved on 4-12% Bis-Tris XT precast gels
(Bio-Rad). The proteins were transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membranes (Bio-Rad),
blocked with 5% low-fat milk solution, and probed for 1 h with primary antibody followed by 45
min with secondary antibody. Bands were detected using SuperSignal West Femto Maximum
Sensitivity Substrate (Thermo Fisher Scientific) and a ChemiDoc XRS+ system (Bio-Rad). The
primary antibodies were mouse anti-V5 tag [Invitrogen, R960-25, 1:2000 (SARS-1-S, MERSS and SARS-2-S) or 1:5000 (229E-S)] and mouse anti-β-actin (Sigma-Aldrich, A5447, 1:5000).
As secondary antibody, we used a peroxidase-coupled goat anti-mouse antibody (Dako,
P0447, 1:5000).
For analysis of S protein incorporation into pseudoparticles, a volume of 600 µl of Spseudotyped MLV virus was loaded onto a 20% (w/v) sucrose cushion (volume 50 µl) and
subjected to high-speed centrifugation (25,000 g for 120 min at 4°C). Thereafter, 630 µl of
supernatant was removed and the residual volume was mixed with 30 µl loading dye
mastermix, consisting of RIPA buffer supplemented with protease inhibitor cocktail (both from
Thermo Fisher Scientific) and 1x XT sample buffer containing 1x XT reducing agent (both from
Bio-Rad). The samples were heated for 5 min at 95°C and subjected to SDS-PAGE and
immunoblotting, as above, with mouse anti-V5 tag (Invitrogen, R960-25) and mouse anti-MLV
p30 antibody (Abcam, ab130757) as primary antibodies.
Statistical analysis
Statistical analysis was performed using GraphPad Prism (version 8.4.3). An ordinary one-way
ANOVA with Dunnett’s correction was performed when comparing multiple groups, while an
unpaired two-tailed t-test was used when comparing only two groups. P ≤ 0.05 was considered
significant. Statistical significance is reported as: *, P ≤ 0.05; **, P ≤ 0.01; ***, P ≤ 0.001; ****,
P ≤ 0.0001.

(A) Experiment set-up. S-bearing pseudoviruses were produced in HEK293T cells at either 33°C or 37°C, and the
released particles were pelleted to determine S content by western blot. In parallel, they were used to transduce
HEK293T target cells expressing the appropriate receptor and TMPRSS2. (B) The graphs show S content relative to
that of MLV-gag (mean ± SEM; of three independently produced stocks). Representative blots show uncleaved and
cleaved S protein bands. (C) Particle infectivity was measured by luminescence read-out at day 3 post transduction. A

Figure 2| Generation of S-pseudoviruses with wild-type spikes, S1/S2 site mutant forms, and the D614G mutant
of SARS-2-S. (A) The CoV S protein contains two main cleavage sites: the S1/S2 site separates the S1 and S2
subunits, whereas S2' cleavage liberates the fusion peptide (FP). (B) Amino acid sequences around the S1/S2 and S2'
cleavage sites of the CoV spikes and mutant forms created in this study. Basic Arg and Lys residues are shown in bold.
For SARS-2-S, the D614/G614 variation site is added. (C) Structure of the SARS-CoV-2 spike trimer, based on PDB
6ZGE (81), in which we modelled the cleavage loop using SWISS-MODEL (82). The amino acids shown in magenta
were substituted or deleted, to create three S1/S2 loop mutants. The inset on the right shows residue D614, which
forms a hydrogen bond with residue T859 in the S2 subunit of another protomer (44, 45).

Figure 6| The SARS-2-S D614G change increases stability and entry via the cathepsin route, and reduces the
preference for 33°C. (A) Thermostability analysis. The pseudoparticles were incubated at the indicated temperatures
for 1 h, followed by 2 h entry into HEK293T target cells and luminescence reading after 72 h. Results are expressed as
transduction efficiency, relative to the condition incubated at 4°C (mean ± SEM, N=3). (B) analysis of the four CoV

Figure S1| HCoV-229E shows temperature-dependent replication with a
preference for 33 and 35°C. Human embryonic lung (HEL) fibroblast cells were
infected with HCoV-229E at 100xCCID50 (determined at 37°C). The viral RNA copy
number in the supernatant was determined at 1, 24, 48, 72 and 96 h post infection (p.i.)
by RT-qPCR with HCoV-229E N-gene specific primers and probe, as described
elsewhere (11). An ordinary one-way ANOVA with Dunnett’s correction was used to
compare the virus copy number at 33, 35 and 39°C vs 37°C. *, P ≤ 0.05; ***, P ≤ 0.001,
****, P ≤ 0.0001, ordinary one-way ANOVA with Dunnett’s correction.

Figure S2| The Calu-3 cell entry defect of S1/S2 loop mutant SARS-2
pseudoviruses is restored when exogenous trypsin is added. Particles were
allowed to bind for 1 h at 4°C after which unbound particles were removed and DMEM
as such with 10 µg/ml TPCK-trypsin was added. After 2 h at 37°C, the medium was
changed again to complete medium with 10% FCS. Results are the mean ± SEM; N=3.
Each trypsin-treated condition was compared to untreated by an unpaired two-tailed ttest. ***, P ≤ 0.001.
