Abstract
Detected in December 2019, the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has since
spread all over the world, resulting in a global pandemic. The disease is caused by
severe acute respiratory syndrome-coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2), and its symptoms
usually include cough, fever, and gastrointestinal problems. Although the prevalence of
rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is about 1 % of the global population and RA patients naturally
have a chance of acquiring COVID-19 in this pandemic, no studies have considered the
expression of angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) (a receptor for SARS-CoV-2) in
synovial tissues. Our presenting data revealed that ACE2 expression was elevated in
active rheumatoid synovium, and siRNA against STAT3 was able to downregulate ACE2
expression, which was in turn induced by IL-6 signaling.

Letters
Severe acute respiratory syndrome-coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) has spread
explosively worldwide and resulted in a pandemic of a new respiratory disease called
coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) in March 2020. Symptoms of COVID-19 include
fever, malaise, cough, and in severe cases, pneumonia and acute respiratory distress
syndrome (1,2). Coronavirus possesses envelope-anchored spike proteins that bind host
cell surface receptors and allow viral entry into target cells. In the case of SARS-CoV-2,
its spike protein mediates binding of the angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2)

receptor (3). While ACE2 expression levels are relatively low in the airway mucosa and
lungs, this protein is predominant in the stomach, intestines, gallbladder, kidney, and
heart (4). Therefore, in COVID-19 patients, SARS-CoV-2 can be detected not only in
nasal and oral swabs but also in rectal samples; viral RNA has also been detected in
patient blood (5).
Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is an autoimmune disease that is characterized by systemic
synovitis and affects about 1% of the world population. The expression pattern of ACE2
in synovial tissues has not yet been reported, although RA patients naturally have a
chance of getting COVID-19 in this pandemic (6-8). In this study, we investigated ACE2
expression

and

mechanism.

Immunohistochemistry analysis revealed that the active rheumatoid synovium, where
remarkable thickening of the synovial lining and mesenchymoid transformation of the
synovial stroma were observed, displayed a higher expression of ACE2 as compared to
inactive samples (Figure 1A). Reverse transcriptase-quantitative polymerase chain
reaction (RT-qPCR) for ACE2 mRNA extracted from the synovium supported these data
(Figure 1B). ACE2 expression was found to be increased in the synovial lining and
sublining regions, suggesting that its expression was elevated in fibroblast-like
synoviocytes (FLS). Primary cultures of these RA-derived FLS revealed that interleukin6 (IL-6) stimulation increased ACE2 expression (Figure 1C). IL-6 is known to regulate
downstream target genes via signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 (STAT3)

signaling activation (9). IL-6 stimulation led to tyrosine phosphorylation of STAT3 (data
not shown). Indeed, the use of small interfering RNA (siRNA) against STAT3 reduced the
IL-6-dependent ACE2 expression in RA-FLS (Figure 1D).
We propose that ACE2 is upregulated in the synovium of active RA patients and is
likely maintained by STAT3-mediated activation through the IL-6 pathway (Figure 1E).
Therefore, RA activity may be able to alter SARS-CoV-2 entry into synovial cells. Further
analyses of IL-6-induced ACE2 transcription in cells other than FLS may help elucidate
the mechanisms of viral entry into target cells, as in vivo IL-6 levels are high in COVID19 patients (2). These data also implies that unplanned preventive withdrawal of diseasemodified antirheumatic drugs (DMARDs) could lead to increase the risk of COVID-19.

Study design
This study was approved by the clinical ethics committees of Hiroshima University
Hospital, Dohgo Spa Hospital and Ehime University Proteo-Science Center and
Graduate School of Medicine and was conducted at these institutions (approval number:
E-668; approval date: 01/02/2017). All experiments were performed in accordance with
the approved guidelines. Synovial tissues were collected from 16 rheumatoid arthritis

replacement, after obtaining informed and signed consent forms. Patients were not
involved in the design, conduct, reporting, or dissemination plans of our research. Active
rheumatoid synovitis was defined by the characteristics of multi-layered lining
(hyperplasia), mesenchymoid transformation, palisading appearance of synovial lining
and proliferation of blood vessels, all detected with hematoxylin and eosin (H & E)
staining.

RNA extraction and reverse transcription quantitative PCR (RT-qPCR)
Total RNA was extracted and purified from synovial tissue (a total of 7 samples from
7 different RA patients) and cultured cells using Trizol reagent (Life Technologies,
Carlsbad, CA, USA), followed by cDNA synthesis using a PrimeScript RT Reagent Kit
with gDNA Eraser (Takara-Bio, Kusatsu, JAPAN). RT-qPCR using Brilliant II SYBRÂ®
Green QPCR Master Mix (Agilent, Santa Clara, CA, USA) was outperformed on CFX

Immunohistochemistry
Sections obtained from formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded tissues (a total of 6 samples
from 6 different RA patients) were used for immunohistochemistry. Following
deparaffinization and antigen retrieval in Tris-EDTA buffer (pH 9.0), the specimens were
first incubated with primary antibodies (anti-ACE2, rabbit polyclonal, Bioss Antibodies
Inc., Woburn, MA, USA), and then with the AP-conjugated secondary antibodies. The
samples were then visualized using ImmPACT Vector Red Alkaline Phosphatase
Substrate (Vector Laboratories, Burlingame, CA, USA), and the slides were
counterstained with hematoxylin solution.

Purification and culture of fibroblast like synoviocytes (FLS)
To obtain FLS, synovial tissues from three different RA patients were minced and
incubated with 1mg/ml collagenase/dispase (Sigma-Aldrich, Tokyo, JAPAN) in PBS
(pH7.2) for 1 hour at 37 Â°C. The tissue samples were then filtered, washed, and cultured.
During the culture, the supernatant was replaced frequently to remove nonadherent cells.
The FLS were cultured in DMEM (FUJIFILM Wako Pure Chemical Corporation, Osaka,
JAPAN)

Transfection experiments using siRNA
A total of 3 Ã— 104 FLS per well in 12-well plates were transfected with siRNA at 20
pmol using ScreenFect siRNA (ScreenFect GmbH, Eggenstein-Leopoldshafen,
Germany), according to the manufacturerâ€™s protocol. The siRNA targeting STAT3
(FlexiTube siRNA, SI02662898) and negative control (Allstar Negative Control siRNA)
were purchased from QIAGEN (Shanghai, China).

Statistical analysis
All graphs show the results of one representative experiment from the several
individual experiments performed. All statistical analyses were performed using
Studentâ€™s t-test. Data were processed and analyzed using the GraphPad Prism 8
software (Graph Pad Software Inc., La Jolla, CA, USA).
