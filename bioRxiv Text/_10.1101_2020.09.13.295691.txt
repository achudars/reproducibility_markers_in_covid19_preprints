Abstract

35

Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), the causative agent

36

of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), enters the host cells through two main pathways, both

37

involving key interactions between viral envelope-anchored spike glycoprotein of the novel

38

coronavirus and the host receptor, angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2). To date, SARS-

39

CoV-2 has infected up to 26 million people worldwide; yet, there is no clinically approved drug or

40

vaccine available. Therefore, a rapid and coordinated effort to re-purpose clinically approved

41

drugs that prevent or disrupt these critical entry pathways of SARS-CoV-2 spike glycoprotein

42

interaction with human ACE2, could potentially accelerate the identification and clinical

43

advancement of prophylactic and/or treatment options against COVID-19, thus providing

44

possible countermeasures against viral entry, pathogenesis and survival. Herein, we discovered

45

that Ambroxol hydrochloride (AMB), and its progenitor, Bromhexine hydrochloride (BHH), both

46

clinically approved drugs are potent effective modulators of the key interaction between the

47

receptor binding domain (RBD) of SARS-CoV-2 spike protein and human ACE2. We also found

48

that both compounds inhibited SARS-CoV-2 infection-induced cytopathic effect at micromolar

49

concentrations. Therefore, in addition to the known TMPRSS2 activity of BHH; we report for the

50

first time that the BHH and AMB pharmacophore has the capacity to target and modulate yet

51

another key protein-protein interaction essential for the two known SARS-CoV-2 entry pathways

52

into host cells. Altogether, the potent efficacy, excellent safety and pharmacologic profile of both

53

drugs along with their affordability and availability, makes them promising candidates for drug

54

repurposing as possible prophylactic and/or treatment options against SARS-CoV-2 infection.

Introduction

68

The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome

69

coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) has emerged as a global pandemic and infected over 26 million

70

individuals, with characteristics ranging from asymptomatic, mild, moderate to severe symptoms,

71

with some people experiencing diverse multi-organ pathologies, substantial morbidity, and

72

mortality1–4. Presently, there is no Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved drug or vaccine

73

available for treatment of COVID-195. Although, there are several clinical studies investigating the

74

possibility of repurposing existing clinically approved drugs as treatment options for COVID-195-9;

75

there still remains an urgent call for the rapid development of antiviral drugs for the prevention

76

and/or treatment of COVID-19.

77

SARS-CoV-2 enters the host cells through two main pathways, both involving key

78

interactions between viral envelope-anchored spike (S) glycoprotein of the novel coronavirus

79

and the host receptor, angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2), a membrane-bound

80

metalloprotease10–13. The first pathway involves receptor mediated endocytosis process; while

81

the second pathway, involves cell fusion also consisting of host receptor recognition and

82

attachment of surface unit S1 to the peptidase domain of ACE2. Here, SARS-CoV-2 S protein is

83

primed at the S1/S2 and the S2’ site by a plasma membrane-associated type II transmembrane

84

serine protease (TMPRSS2), which triggers fusion of viral and cellular membranes, an essential

85

step for release of the viral contents into the host cell cytosol14,15. X-ray crystallography and

86

structural studies of human ACE2 revealed two domains; the N-terminal zinc metallopeptidase

87

domain (MPD), which binds to the viral receptor binding domain (RBD) within the S

88

glycoprotein, and a C terminal “collectrin-like” domain16–18. The crucial interaction between the

89

MPD of human ACE2 and RBD of SARS-CoV-2 S glycoprotein has been characterized as an

90

initial and critical step in viral infection10-13. Therefore, repurposing clinically approved drugs that

91

could potentially prevent or disrupt this key interaction between SARS-CoV-2 S glycoprotein

92

and human ACE2, could accelerate the clinical advancement of prophylactic and/or treatment

93

options against COVID-19, thus providing possible countermeasures against viral entry,

94

pathogenesis and survival.

95

Ambroxol hydrochloride ((AMB) 4-[(2-amino-3,5-dibromophenyl) methylamino]cyclohexan-

96

1-ol; hydrochloride)19, belonging to the benzylamine structural class, is a demethylated active

97

metabolite of Bromhexine hydrochloride (BHH) 20. Both AMB and its progenitor, BHH are widely

98

prescribed drugs used to treat respiratory tract infections and disorders 21–24, clinically indicated

99

for their secretolytic activity for treatment of acute and chronic bronchopulmonary diseases

associated with abnormal mucus secretion and impaired mucus transport20,21,24. Traditionally,

101

AMB and BHH have been available, affordable and used as over the counter drugs, with no

102

significant adverse effects24,25. Furthermore, AMB and BHH have been extensively investigated in

103

translational studies because of their multiple activities including mucociliary clearance activity,

104

mucokinetic properties, stimulation of surfactant production, anti-inflammatory and antioxidative

105

actions, and the local anesthetic effect 22,23,26–28. More recent studies have shown that AMB and

106

BHH both induce cellular autophagic-lysosome pathway 29–31, critical processes in the host

107

defense machinery against viral infections32. Additional studies have also shown the involvement

108

of AMB in the modulation of homeostasis of ions such as, sodium, hydrogen, and calcium33.

109

Moreover, AMB gained renewed interest as a potential drug for the clinical development of

110

therapeutics for neurodegenerative diseases 34, due to its potential to act as a chaperone, pH-

111

dependent, mixed-type inhibitor of glucocerebrosidase (GCase), and its involvement in

112

mechanisms for mitochondria, lysosomal biogenesis, and secretory pathway 31, 33, 34. Other than

113

the plethora of molecular impact and physiologic functions of the AMB pharmacophore mentioned

114

above, reports have also shown that AMB could inhibit viruses that cause influenza and rhinovirus

115

infections35,36. In addition, AMB’s progenitor BHH is an established potent inhibitor of TMPRSS237,

116

one of the key proteases for viral fusion into host cells. BHH’s activity against TMPRSS2 and lung

117

protective properties makes it an attractive drug for the prevention and/or treatment of coronavirus

118

infections 38,39. To date, COVID-19 clinical trials investigating the impact of BHH (and/or in

119

combination with other drugs) on SARS-CoV-2 infection are ongoing or completed in some

120

countries [NCT04273763; NCT04340349; NCT04355026; NCT04424134; NCT04405999 and

121

IRCT202003117046797N4]. However, the exact mechanism of action of the BHH and AMB

122

pharmacophore against SARS-CoV-2 infection needs to be elucidated.

123

In this study, we evaluated the effects of AMB, and its progenitor, BHH, on the

124

interaction between recombinant human ACE2 (rhACE2) and the RBD of the S protein of

125

SARS-CoV-2. We also determined the effect of both compounds on SARS-CoV-2 infection-

126

induced cytopathic effect (CPE) in vitro and assessed their cytotoxicity, in comparison to other

127

clinically approved drugs. Herein, we discovered that AMB and BHH, effectively modulated the

128

rhACE2’s interaction with Spike (RBD) protein in the micromolar range. We also found that both

129

compounds inhibited SARS-CoV-2 infection-induced CPE at certain concentrations. Therefore,

130

in addition to the known TMPRSS2 activity of BHH37; we report for the first time that AMB and

131

BHH pharmacophore have the capacity to target and modulate yet another key protein-protein

132

interaction essential for the two known SARS-CoV-2 entry pathways in to human cells.

133

Altogether, the potent efficacy, excellent safety and pharmacologic profile of both drugs along

Cell Growth Conditions and Medium

140

African Green Monkey Kidney Vero E6 cells (ATCC# CRL-1586, American Tissue Culture Type)

141

were maintained using medium purchased from Gibco (modified eagle’s medium (MEM) Gibco

142

(#11095); 10% fetal bovine serum (HI FBS) Gibco (#14000); Penicillin/Streptomycin (PS) Gibco

143

(#15140); 10U/mL penicillin and 10µg/mL streptomycin (only in assay media)). For the SARS-

144

CoV-2 infection induced cytopathic effect (CPE) assay, cells were grown in MEM/10% HI FBS

145

and harvested in MEM/1% PS/supplemented with 2% HI FBS. Cells were batch inoculated with

146

SARS-CoV-2 USA_WA1/2020 (M.O.I. ~ 0.002) which resulted in 5-10% cell viability 72 hours

147

post infection.

148
149

Compounds and Preparation of Stock Solutions

150

We prepared 10mM stocks solutions of the inhibitors in Dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO; D8418-

151

Lot#SHBL5613) purchased from Sigma Aldrich. Ambroxol Hydrochloride (AMB; A9797 - Lot #

152

BCCB1637), and Bromhexine Hydrochloride (BHH; 17343 - Lot # BCBJ8156V) were also

153

purchased from Sigma Aldrich. Both compound samples were serially diluted 2-fold in DMSO

154

nine times and screened in duplicates for the SARS-CoV-2 infection induced cytopathic effect

155

assay. The reference compounds used for the CPE and cytotoxicity assays were made

156

available by SRI. Assay Ready Plates (ARPs; Corning 3764BC) pre-drugged with test

157

compounds (90 nL sample in 100% DMSO per well dispensed using a Labcyte (ECHO 550)

158

were prepared in the Biosafety Level-2 (BSL-2) laboratory by adding 5µL assay media to each

159

well.

Method for Measuring Antiviral Effect of AMB and BHH

162

Southern Research Institute (SRI), located in Birmingham, Alabama performed the SARS-CoV-

163

2 infection induced cytopathic effect (CPE) assay and cytotoxicity assays through a sub-contract

164

from Texas Southern University, Houston, Texas. The CPE reduction assay was conducted

165

using a high throughput-screening (HTS) format as previously described 40,41. Specifically, Vero

166

E6 cells selected for expression of the SARS-CoV-2 receptor (ACE2; angiotensin-converting

167

enzyme 2) were used for the CPE assay. Cells were grown in MEM/10% HI FBS supplemented

168

and harvested in MEM/1% PS/ supplemented with 2% HI FBS. Cells were batch inoculated

169

with SARS-CoV-2 (M.O.I. ~ 0.002) which resulted in 5% cell viability 72 hours post infection.

170

Compound samples were serially diluted 2-fold in DMSO nine times and screened in duplicates.

171

Assay Ready Plates (ARPs; Corning 3764 BC black-walled, clear bottom plates) pre-drugged

172

with test compounds (90 nL sample in 100% DMSO per well dispensed using a Labcyte (ECHO

173

550) were prepared in the BSL-2 lab by adding 5µL assay media to each well. The plates were

174

passed into the BSL-3 facility where a 25µL aliquot of virus inoculated cells (4000 Vero E6

175

cells/well) was added to each well in columns 3-22. The wells in columns 23-24 contained virus

176

infected cells only (no compound treatment). Prior to virus infection, a 25µL aliquot of cells was

177

added to columns 1-2 of each plate for the cell only (no virus) controls. After incubating plates at

178

37°C/5%CO2 and 90% humidity for 72 hours, 30µL of Cell Titer-Glo (Promega) was added to

179

each well. Luminescence was read using a Perkin Elmer Envision or BMG CLARIOstar plate

180

reader following incubation at room temperature for 10 minutes to measure cell viability. Raw

181

data from each test well was normalized to the average (Avg) signal of non-infected cells (Avg

182

Cells; 100% inhibition) and virus infected cells only (Avg Virus; 0% inhibition) to calculate %

183

inhibition of CPE using the following formula: % inhibition = 100*(Test Cmpd - Avg Virus)/(Avg

184

Cells – Avg Virus). The SARS CPE assay was conducted in BSL-3 containment with plates

185

being sealed with a clear cover and surface decontaminated prior to luminescence reading.

186
187

Determination of Cytotoxic Effect of AMB and BHH

188

The cytotoxicity of AMB and BHH were assessed in a BSL-2 counter screen using the Cell Titer-

189

Glo Luminescent Cell Viability Assay as previously described41. Briefly, host cells in media were

190

added in 25µL aliquots (4000 cells/well) to each well of assay ready plates prepared with test

191

compounds as above. Cells only (100% viability) and cells treated with hyamine at 100µM final

192

concentration (0% viability) serve as the high and low signal controls, respectively, for cytotoxic

193

effect in the assay. DMSO was maintained at a constant concentration for all wells (0.3%) as

194

dictated by the dilution factor of stock test compound concentrations. After incubating plates at

195

37°C/5%CO2 and 90% humidity for 72 hours, 30µl CellTiter Glo (CTG) (G7573, Promega) was

196

added to each well. Luminescence was read using a BMG CLARIOstar plate reader following

197

incubation at room temperature for 10 minutes to measure cell viability.

202

manufacturer’s protocol42 to determine the effect of AMB and BHH on the interaction between

203

SARS-CoV-2 Spike (RBD) Protein and recombinant human ACE2. The in vitro enzyme-linked

204

immunoabsorbent assay (ELISA) was performed in a transparent flat-bottom 96-well plate. We

205

prepared 10mM stock solutions of the compounds in Dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO), with serially

206

diluted the compounds in DMSO as follows: 100, 50, 10, 5, 1, 0.5, and 0.1 µM for AMB and

207

BHH. All experiments were performed in triplicates. Each plate contained positive controls (1%

208

DMSO) and blank controls with no ACE2. Specifically, 1 µL of serially diluted compounds were

209

incubated with recombinant SARS-CoV-2 Spike receptor binding domain (RBD) protein, pre-

210

coated on the 96 well plates in 49 µL of 1X assay diluent buffer for about 30 mins, at room

211

temperature (22°C) with shaking at 180 rpm. Then, we added 50 µL of ACE2 protein in 1X

212

assay diluent buffer into the 96 well plate, and incubated for 2.5 hrs at room temperature (22°C)

213

with shaking at 180 rpm. Thereafter, the solution was discarded and the plate was washed

214

consecutively four times with 300 µL 1X wash buffer, followed by the addition of the detection

215

antibody (anti-ACE2 goat antibody). The reaction was allowed to go on for 1 hr at room

216

temperature (22°C) with shaking at 180rpm. Then, the solution was discarded and the wash

217

step was repeated as described above. Next, the HRP-conjugated anti-goat IgG was added to

218

each well, and the reaction plate was further incubated for 1 hr at room temperature (22°C) with

219

shaking at 180rpm. Again, the solution was discarded and the wash step was repeated as

220

described above. Then, 100µL of 3,3’,5,5’-tetramethylbenzidine (TMB) one-step substrate was

221

added to each well, and reaction mixtures were incubated in the dark at room temperature

222

(22°C) with shaking at 180rpm for 30 mins. The reaction was stopped by the addition of 50 µL

223

stop solution. The absorbance was read at 405 nm using a Beckman Coulter DTX880

224

multimode plate reader. The background hydrolysis was subtracted and the data was fitted to a

225

special bell-shaped dose-response curve equation using GraphPad prism software 8.4.3.

Effects of AMB and BHH on Spike (RBD) Glycoprotein and rhACE2 Interaction

238

The interaction of human ACE2 and the receptor binding domain (RBD) of the SARS-CoV-2 S

239

protein has been reported as a critical step in viral infection for both the endocytosis and non-

240

endocytosis pathways of viral entry into host cells 10-15, 43. We evaluated the effect of AMB and

241

its progenitor, BHH on the binding affinity of rhACE2 and RBD of SARS-CoV-2 S protein at

242

concentrations ranging from 100 µM to 100 nM, using an adapted in vitro enzyme-linked

243

immunoabsorbent assay (ELISA)42. We observed a unique dose-response curve for both

244

compounds (using the special bell shape curve model). AMB displayed the highest inhibition of

245

S (RBD)-rhACE2 protein interaction at lower micromolar concentrations (ranging from 100nM to

246

10µM); compared to higher concentrations of AMB from 50 µM (Figure 1B). Interestingly, we

247

found that BHH inhibited the binding of SARS-CoV-2’s S (RBD) protein to rhACE2 receptor at

248

lower concentrations ranging from 100 nM to 10 µM; but enhanced the interaction at higher

249

concentrations of BHH from 50 µM (Figure 1A). Hence, the bell shaped model generated two

250

IC50 values (IC50_1 and IC50_2) as shown in Table 4. Unlike BHH, we did not observe a stimulation

251

or enhancement of binding of SARS-CoV-2’s Spike (RBD) protein to rhACE2 receptor for its

252

metabolite – AMB, at the concentrations we tested. However, using the bell curve model, the

253

graphpad software generated a second IC50_2 at 232 µM for AMB, greater than the highest

254

concentration tested (100 µM). Moreover, the unconventional dose response curve observed in

255

this protein interaction assay, could be intrinsic to the mode of inhibition or an indicator of

256

additional binding site(s) and/or target(s), for the BHH and AMB, such as other sites on rhACE2

257

or the Spike (RBD) protein. To our knowledge, these finding is the first report to reveal that AMB

258

inhibits and interferes with the binding between rhACE2 receptor and SARS-CoV-2 S (RBD)

259

glycoprotein in vitro; while BHH inhibits this critical interaction at lower concentrations and

260

enhances at higher concentrations (Table 4). These results suggest that AMB might be a

261

promising lead for clinical development of novel SARS-CoV-2 entry inhibitors and potential

262

COVID-19 therapeutics (Figure 2). Altogether, these results reveal a new pharmacologic mode

263

of action and novel target for AMB and its progenitor, BHH.

progenitor, BHH, using a standard luminescent-based high-throughput screening (HTS)

271

platform40,41 for SARS-CoV-2 infection induced CPE in African Green Monkey Kidney Vero E6

272

cells. We found that, BHH inhibited SARS-CoV-2 infection induced CPE in vitro with 50%

273

Inhibitory Concentration (IC50) value at about 21.72 µM; while AMB’s IC50 was greater than 30

274

µM, the highest concentration tested (Table 1). At this maximum concentration, AMB displayed

275

14.25% inhibition of SARS-CoV-2 induced CPE. Compared to its metabolite; BHH exhibited the

276

highest maximum inhibition at about 91.08% inhibition at 30 µM (Table 1). Additional higher

277

concentrations need to be tested in future studies to determine the actual IC50 value of AMB

278

against SARS-CoV-2 infection induced CPE in Vero E6 cells. Furthermore, we compared the

279

antiviral effects of AMB and BHH with five other known inhibitors of SARS-CoV-2 in vitro:

280

Calpain Inhibitor IV, Chloroquine, Remdesivir, Hydroxychloroquine and Aloxistatin. We found

281

that the IC50 for most of the reference compounds (Calpain Inhibitor IV (0.29µM), Chloroquine

282

(3.56µM), Hydroxychloroquine (5.16µM), Remdesivir (8.54µM)) were lower than the IC50S values

283

for BHH and AMB. However, the IC50 of Aloxistatin (21.78 µM) was similar to that of BHH (21.72

284

µM) (Table 1 and 2). The IC50 values that we observed for the reference compounds are

285

consistent with earlier reports

286

studies tested BHH and AMB at certain or single concentrations 48–50; however, this is the first

287

study to our knowledge to conduct the IC50 evaluation for BHH and AMB against the novel

288

SARS-CoV-2 infection induced CPE.

Cytotoxicity Effects of AMB and BHH in Vero E6 cells.

291

Using a Cell Titer-Glo Luminescent Cell Viability Assay41, we determined the cytotoxicity of AMB

292

and BHH. We also assessed the cytotoxic effects of the reference compounds in Vero E6 cells

293

and observed that, the 50% cytotoxic concentration (CC50) of AMB and BHH were greater than

294

30 µM. In comparison to the other reference compounds tested, AMB and BHH displayed

295

slightly higher percent maximum and minimum viability at the concentrations tested (Table 3).

296

Between the two compounds, we observed a higher percent minimum viability for AMB

297

(113.95%), compared to its progenitor, BHH (103.87%) at 30 µM (Table 3). These cytotoxicity

results are consistent with the known clinical safety profiles of both compounds, with AMB

299

showing better pharmacokinetic and safety profiles compared to BHH51.

DISCUSSION

305

The emergence of novel SARS-CoV-2 strains has imposed an urgent call to accelerate the

306

repurposing and advancement of existing clinically safe and approved drugs as effective

307

prophylactic and/or therapeutic agents for combating the COVID-19 pandemic. The crystal

308

structure of full length human ACE2 revealed that the RBD on SARS-CoV-2 S1 binds directly to

309

the metallopeptidase domain (MPD) of ACE2 receptor10-13. In this study, we explored the

310

possibility of a clinically safe and approved drug, AMB and its progenitor, BHH as potential

311

effectors of the interaction between SARS-CoV-2’s Spike protein receptor binding domain and

312

recombinant human ACE2 receptor, a critical first step in the two significant pathways required

313

for viral entry into host cells10-15,43 and initiation of pathogenesis (Figure 2). Using a sensitive

314

ELISA42, we found that AMB and its progenitor, BHH modulates the interaction of rhACE2 and S

315

(RBD) protein, with AMB being the most potent effector. Significant inhibition of the interaction

316

between SARS-CoV-2’s S (RBD) protein and rhACE2 by AMB at nanomolar to micromolar

317

concentrations provides strong evidence that this pharmacophore could serve as a promising

318

lead for the discovery and clinical development of novel SARS-CoV-2 entry inhibitors and

319

potential COVID-19 therapeutics. On the other hand, we found that BHH, enhances this key

320

interaction between Spike (RBD) protein and rhACE2 at higher concentrations; while inhibiting

321

at lower concentrations. To our knowledge, this is the first experimental study revealing this

322

class of compounds as potent effectors of the binding of Spike (RBD) protein to rhACE2, a new

323

pharmacologic mode of action for potentially modulating viral entry into host cells. In vivo

324

pharmacodynamics and pharmacokinetic studies are warranted to further explore the

325

physiologic relevance of the inhibitory activity of AMB, as well as the dual inhibitory and

326

enhancement activities of BHH in the context of SARS-CoV-2 infection.

327

Our findings regarding the “paradoxical behavior” of BHH in vitro biochemical assay, are

328

consistent with a recent report by Hörnich, B.F. et. al., that revealed that BHH enhanced SARS-

329

CoV-2 S-mediated fusion in 293T cells at the concentrations tested48. Moreover, the

330

unconventional dose-response curve that we observed in our interaction studies suggests that

331

there may be more than one binding site for interaction of rhACE2 and Spike (RBD) protein for

332

BHH and its metabolite-AMB, resulting in the potent inhibition of interaction at lower micromolar

333

concentrations; compared to the impact at higher concentrations. This may also explain the

334

enhancement of interaction by BHH at higher concentrations. Interestingly, a molecular dynamic

335

study by Silva de Souza et al.52, revealed that two different regions within the RBD of SARS-CoV-

336

2 interact differently with hACE2 in the presence of high salt concentrations (E1, is more

337

hydrophobic; while E2 favors more polar interactions). Hence, suggesting that these differences

10

bioRxiv preprint doi: https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.09.13.295691; this version posted September 14, 2020. The copyright holder for this preprint

338

may impact how effectors modulate these sites and affect the binding between RBD to hACE2.

339

Future computational modeling and X-ray co-crystallization studies of the compounds with

340

rhACE2 and Spike (RBD) may provide additional insight into the mode of inhibition (for AMB)

341

and/or enhancement in the case of BHH. Besides, this will facilitate the rational design of novel

342

drugs that could inhibit this interaction and in turn, prevent viral entry into human cells. In addition,

343

synthesis of more potent inhibitors in the AMB-containing, benzylamine structural class and SAR

344

studies could accelerate the discovery of novel anti-SARS-CoV-2 agents.

345

Furthermore, we investigated the effect of AMB and BHH on SARS-CoV-2 infection

346

induced CPE in vitro, using a simple and rapid cellular high throughput screening assay40,41.

347

Although, AMB was found to be the most potent against rhACE2-RBD interaction in the

348

biochemical assay compared to BHH; however, in the cellular CPE assay, AMB had a higher IC50

349

than BHH for antiviral activity. Additionally, we observed that the IC50 values of the compounds in

350

the cellular CPE assay were much higher than the IC50s in the rhACE2-Spike(RBD) protein

351

interaction assay, although the special bell curve model produced two IC50s due to the mode of

352

inhibition at lower concentrations versus higher concentrations. Therefore, in vivo

353

pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamics studies will be required to ascertain half maximal

354

effective concentrations (EC50) for both drugs. Consistent with our study, a high throughput screen

355

of clinically approved drugs by Tourte et. al. 50 also identified AMB as an inhibitor of SARS-CoV-2

356

infection in vitro at 10 µM. Our findings for percent inhibitions for AMB in the CPE assay in Vero

357

E6 cells are also consistent with a recent study by Bradfute, S.B. et. al49., in which they reported

358

that AMB could inhibit SARS-CoV-2 infection in vitro at high concentrations49. Our biochemical

359

findings are most complementary to the report by Hornich, B.F. et. al., that observed inhibition of

360

SARS-CoV-2-S-mediated fusion in the presence of 50 µM AMB48; but observed a dose

361

dependent enhancement of SARS-CoV-2-S-mediated fusion by BHH at the concentrations

362

tested48. Furthermore, a computational transcriptomics study by Napolitano, F. et al. 53, found that

363

AMB induced an opposite transcriptional profile compared to that induced by SARS-CoV-2

364

infection in vitro, suggesting that it may be playing a role in counteracting viral infection53.

365

Altogether, our findings provide a novel protein-protein interaction target and strong supporting

366

evidence that may explain the mechanism of action for the AMB and BHH pharmacophore (Figure

367

2).

368

In addition, we conducted a comparative analysis of the dose-response curves of antiviral

369

activity and cytotoxicity of AMB and BHH with five other known inhibitors of SARS-CoV-2 in vitro,

370

which we refer to as “reference compounds.” We found that the IC50 range for BHH and AMB were

371

similar to that of Aloxistatin (Table 1 and 2); but higher than the other reference compounds,

11

372

namely, Chloroquine, Hydroxychloroquine, Remdesivir, and Calpain Inhibitor IV. On the other

373

hand, when we assessed the cytotoxicity of AMB and BHH in Vero E6 cells, we observed that

374

both compounds displayed higher percent maximum and minimum viability at the concentrations

375

tested (Table 3) compared to the other reference compounds. Moreover, AMB had a slightly

376

higher percent minimum viability compared to BHH, consistent with other reported safety studies

377

for both compounds, that demonstrate that AMB has superior safety profile than BHH51. Thus,

378

considering that AMB is safe and clinically approved, our findings that AMB significantly inhibited

379

binding of rhACE2 receptor with SARS-CoV-2 Spike (RBD) protein and moderately inhibited

380

SARS-CoV-2 infection induced CPE at the concentration tested, strongly supports the notion that

381

AMB could be a safe drug option for the clinical advancement of counter measures against

382

COVID-19. In addition, AMB and its progenitor – BHH, could be used as chemical probes to study

383

the biology of host-pathogen interaction in the context of SARS-CoV-2 infections, particularly in

384

the pre-clinical development of novel entry inhibitors. Our findings not only provides strong in vitro

385

evidence and mechanism, for the proposed use of AMB as a therapeutic option for the treatment

386

of COVID-19; but also sheds light on the relevance of this pharmacophore as potential

387

prophylactic options for prevention of SARS-CoV-2 infection.

388

Both AMB and BHH have been used in the clinic for treatment of respiratory conditions

389

and are extensively studied, because of their multiple pharmacologic effects and safety profile20-24.

390

In addition to their impact on lung physiology and function with regards to mucociliary clearance,

391

mucokinetic properties, and stimulation of surfactant production, they have also been shown to

392

elicit anti-inflammatory, antioxidative and anesthetic effects20-24 Additional studies have reported

393

that both compounds induce cellular autophagic-lysosome pathway 29-31. Reports have also

394

shown the involvement of AMB in modulation of the homeostasis of ions such as sodium,

395

hydrogen, and calcium33, 51. Additionally, AMB has gained attention clinically as a potential drug to

396

repurpose for treatment of neurodegenerative diseases31, 34. Moreover, AMB is known to inhibit

397

certain viruses in vitro and in vivo, with one proposed mechanism as that of preventing the

398

release of RNA into the cytoplasm by increasing the endosomal pH35,36. This may suggest the

399

possibility of additional mechanisms of action beyond viral entry pathways, that is, post-entry of

400

virus into host cells. Given the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic and the lack of clinically approved

401

vaccine or drugs; AMB and its progenitor, BHH could be possible drug leads, because of earlier

402

reports of BHH’s inhibitory activity against TMPRSS2 at low micromolar concentrations37.

403

However in a recent study, unlike Camostat, another known TMPRSS2 inhibitor; AMB and BHH

404

did not reverse TMPRSS2-mediated enhancement of SARS-CoV-2 infection in 293Tcells48.

405

Suggesting that AMB and BHH, may have additional modes/sites of action48. Hence, our finding

12

bioRxiv preprint doi: https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.09.13.295691; this version posted September 14, 2020. The copyright holder for this preprint

406

that AMB and BHH is an effector of the RBD-rhACE2 interaction could shed more light on the

407

mode of SARS-CoV-2 inhibition.

408

The clinical advancement of the AMB pharmacophore could potentially accelerate their

409

consideration for repurposing as potential antiviral agents against COVID19, in non-human

410

primate (NHP) models of SARS-CoV-2 infection, and in clinical trials. Ongoing COVID19 clinical

411

trials [NCT04273763; NCT04340349; and NCT04355026; NCT04424134; NCT04405999]

412

investigating the impact of BHH use prophylactically and/or for treatment in combination therapy

413

for SARS-CoV-2 infection may provide more insight on the relevance of this pharmacophore in

414

counteracting viral entry, pathogenesis and survival. To date, the only published clinical trials

415

results of BHH, is that of a completed open-label randomized clinical trial conducted in Tabriz,

416

North West of Iran 54. This small sample-size study, revealed that early administration of oral BHH

417

decreases the intensive care unit transfer, intubation, and the mortality rate in patients with

418

COVID-1954. Additional large scale and multi-country trials are needed to assess and ascertain

419

the effect of BHH and/or AMB on clinical outcomes and mortality in COVID-19 patients. Moreover,

420

previous studies by others have shown that both AMB and BHH could enhance the lung levels of

421

certain antibiotics when used in combination29,30, suggesting that combination therapy with other

422

known antimicrobials with antiviral activity against SARS-CoV-2 could be explored in COVID-19

423

clinical studies. Therefore, we propose the clinical evaluation and comparative analysis of the

424

impact of AMB or BHH (or in combination with other available therapeutics) to reduce COVID19

425

morbidity and mortality.

426

Overall, the abundance of clinical evidence on the pharmacologic spectrum of activity of

427

AMB, combined with its extensive clinical safety profile, affordability and availability, makes this

428

an attractive and promising drug for targeting the binding of SARS-CoV-2 Spike (RBD) to

429

rhACE2, an essential biologic interaction for viral entry into host cells10-13. The unique potential

430

of AMB and/or BHH in modulating the two currently known viral entry pathways, makes this

431

pharmacophore promising as possible prophylactic agents against SARS-CoV-2 infection. One

432

of the main strengths of our study is the use of a rapid and sensitive ELISA, to identify and

433

characterize two existing clinical drugs as novel inhibitors of the critical interaction between

434

SARS-CoV-2 Spike (RBD) protein and rhACE2. However, our study has some limitations such

435

as the use of Vero E6 cells that were selected for high expression of human ACE2 in the

436

antiviral assay40,41. Besides, future studies exploring structural activity relationship (SAR) with

437

derivatives of AMB, with a similar pharmacophore, improved efficacy and similar/better safety

438

profile, will facilitate the discovery and pre-clinical development of new chemical molecules as

439

potential options for COVID-19 prevention and/or treatment. SAR studies will also provide

13

440

additional insight into the mode of action of this pharmacophore and aid in the rational

441

design/discovery of new countermeasures against SARS-CoV-2 infection.

442
443
444

CONCLUSION AND SIGNIFICANCE
Repurposing clinically approved drugs with novel mechanisms of action and/or multiple

445

cellular targets could potentially disrupt viral pathogenesis, survival and/or prevent the viral entry

446

and interaction with host receptor, ACE2. This approach to drug discovery could accelerate the

447

clinical development of anti-COVID-19 prophylactics/treatments, thus providing

448

countermeasures against COVID-19 and its impact on population health, healthcare systems,

449

and the global economy55. Our novel findings of AMB and BHH as modulators of the binding of

450

rhACE2 with SARS-CoV-2 Spike (RBD) protein provide new insights into the mode of action

451

and additional molecular target(s) for AMB and its progenitor, BHH. Thus, validating this

452

chemical class as promising leads for clinical development of novel SARS-CoV-2 entry

453

inhibitors that could be used for potential COVID-19 prevention and/or treatment. Additionally,

454

because these pharmacophore was shown earlier to have activity against TMPRSS2; and now

455

we found that it inhibits rhACE2-RBD interaction, thus, probably targeting more than one

456

protein. Therefore, this pharmacophore represents a favorable drug class that could possibly

457

be studied as lead series in the development of countermeasures for limiting SARS-CoV-2 drug

458

resistance in the future. Also its clinical efficacy as a secretolytic and anti-inflammatory agent

459

makes it a promising drug for COVID-19 treatment due to lung injury. Therefore, we propose

460

additional pharmacologic and clinical studies to further explore AMB and/or its derivatives as

461

prophylaxis and/or treatment options in the toolbox for combating this novel coronavirus.
