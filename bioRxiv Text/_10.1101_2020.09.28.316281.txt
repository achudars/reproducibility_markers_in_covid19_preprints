SUMMARY

13

The ongoing COVID-19 pandemic is responsible for worldwide economic damage and nearly one

14

million deaths. Potent drugs for the treatment of severe SARS-CoV-2 infections are not yet available.

15

To identify host factors that support coronavirus infection, we performed genome-wide functional

16

genetic screens with SARS-CoV-2 and the common cold virus HCoV-229E in non-transgenic human

17

cells. These screens identified PI3K type 3 as a potential drug target against multiple coronaviruses. We

18

discovered that the lysosomal protein TMEM106B is an important host factor for SARS-CoV-2

19

infection. Furthermore, we show that TMEM106B is required for replication in multiple human cell

20

lines derived from liver and lung and is expressed in relevant cell types in the human airways. Our

21

results identify new coronavirus host factors that may potentially serve as drug targets against SARS-

22

CoV-2 or to quickly combat future zoonotic coronavirus outbreaks.

INTRODUCTION

25

The recent pandemic of Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome-Coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2), the

26

causative agent of COVID-19 (Coronavirus Disease 2019), has caused a worldwide health crisis with

27

more than 33,000,000 confirmed infections and almost one million deaths, with numbers still rising

28

(Dong et al., 2020). As for today, only two drugs have shown some clinical efficacy for the treatment of

29

COVID-19 patients. The investigational antiviral drug remdesivir has been temporarily approved by

30

authorities for emergency use on hospitalized patients with severe COVID-19, as it was shown in clinical

31

trials to shorten the time to recovery in some cases (Beigel et al., 2020). Dexamethasone, an affordable

32

and widely available steroid, can reduce mortality by one-third among patients critically ill with

33

COVID-19, by supressing the hyperactive inflammatory immune response these patients suffer from in

34

response to viral infection (Horby et al., 2020). Since both treatments only seem to benefit severe cases

35

of COVID-19 and only to some limited extent, there is still an urgent need for efficient and safe

36

therapeutic options to treat infected people while awaiting the development and worldwide

37

implementation of safe and effective vaccines to halt the pandemic.

38

Coronaviruses are enveloped positive-sense RNA viruses that contain large genomes of up to 33.5 kb

39

and have characteristic club-shaped spikes projecting from their virion surface (Fehr and Perlman,

40

2015). Coronaviruses cause respiratory and intestinal infections in a broad range of mammals and birds.

41

Seven human coronaviruses (HCoVs) have been identified so far, which likely all emerged as zoonosis

42

from bats, mice or domestic animals (Ye et al., 2020). The four so-called ‘common cold HCoVs’ are the

43

alphacoronaviruses 229E and NL63, and betacoronaviruses OC43 and HKU1, which only cause mild

44

upper respiratory tract illnesses (Liu et al., 2020). In contrast, the betacoronaviruses SARS-CoV, MERS-

45

CoV and the recently emerged SARS-CoV-2, are highly pathogenic and can cause severe, potentially

46

lethal respiratory infections. Since a large diversity of coronavirus types resides in animals and

47

interspecies transmission frequently occurs (Chan et al., 2013; Cui et al., 2019; Ye et al., 2020), there is

48

a high likelihood for the emergence of new pathogenic coronaviruses that can spread into the human

49

population to pandemic proportions, as exemplified by the recent outbreak of SARS-CoV-2. Despite

50

this risk and its great economic and social impact, our options to prevent or treat coronavirus infections

51

remain very limited. Hence, the development of broad-spectrum antiviral drugs against members of this

52

virus family could help not only to address the current high medical need, but also to quickly combat

53

and contain zoonotic events in the future.

54

To develop such drugs, it is crucial to understand which host factors coronaviruses require to infect a

55

cell, as in principle each step of the coronavirus replication cycle (receptor binding, endocytosis, fusion,

56

translation of viral replication proteins and structural proteins, genome replication, virion assembly and

57

release), may serve as target for antiviral intervention. While the viral entry step of coronaviruses has

58

been relatively well characterized, the host-virus interplay in later steps of the viral life cycle remains

59

largely elusive. For SARS-CoV-2, previous studies have shown that the protein angiotensin-converting

60

enzyme 2 (ACE2) can serve as a receptor in Vero E6 cells (Wei et al., 2020) or in human cells

61

overexpressing ACE2 (Hoffmann et al., 2020; Zhou et al., 2020; Zhu et al., 2020). In addition, it was

62

shown that the SARS-CoV-2 spike (S) can be primed for fusion by cellular proteases such as furin,

63

transmembrane serine protease 2 (TMPRSS2) and cathepsin B or L, depending on the target cell type

64

(Hoffmann et al., 2020; Shang et al., 2020).

65

In this study, we performed a series of genome-wide CRISPR-based genetic screens in human cells to

66

identify host factors required for SARS-CoV-2 and HCoV-229E infection. We identified PI3K type 3

67

as a common host factor for SARS-CoV-2, HCoV-229E, and HCoV-OC43, and show that small

68

molecules targeting this protein might serve as broadly applicable anti-coronavirus inhibitors.

69

Furthermore, we discovered that the lysosomal protein TMEM106B serves as an important specific host

70

factor for SARS-CoV-2 infection in multiple liver- and lung-derived human cell lines.

77

been performed to date is SARS-CoV-2. These screens were performed either in the African green

78

monkey cell line Vero E6, or in human cells that were engineered to overexpress ACE2. Here, we chose

79

to perform a CRISPR-based genome-wide knockout screen in human cells without introducing an

80

exogenous receptor. To that end, we used the human liver cell line Huh7 in which our clinical isolate of

81

SARS-CoV-2 was naturally able to induce a clear cytopathic effect (CPE). We performed screens with

82

both SARS-CoV-2 as well as the less pathogenic HCoV-229E (Figure 1A-D). This allowed us to

83

identify both (i) broad-spectrum coronavirus host factors as well as (ii) specific host factors for SARS-

84

CoV-2 and HCoV-229E. Huh7 cells were transduced with the Brunello genome-wide library (Doench

85

et al., 2016), treated with puromycin to eliminate untransduced cells, and then selected for survival

86

during infection with either coronavirus, followed by sgRNA identification in the remaining cell

87

population by deep sequencing for target deconvolution. We performed high stringency screens for

88

HCoV-229E (Figure 1B) and SARS-CoV-2 (Figure 1C) by exposing cells to the virus until nearly all

89

cells had died. For SARS-CoV-2, we also performed a lower stringency screen (Figure 1D) to identify

90

genes with a more subtle effect on viral infection. However, low stringency screens may have an

91

increased background and rather select for genes related to cell proliferation or general stress responses.

92

The high stringency SARS-CoV-2 screen (Figure 1C) identified one significantly enriched gene,

93

TMEM106B, while a larger number of genes was enriched in the low stringency screen (Figure 1B). In

94

contrast to previously published genome-wide screens with SARS-CoV-2, our screen did not identify

95

ACE2. This difference is probably due to the fact that previous screens were performed in human cells

96

that overexpress ACE2 (Heaton et al., 2020; Zhu et al., 2020) or in Vero E6 cells (Wei et al., 2020).

97

Vero E6 cells express high levels of ACE2, whereas ACE2 is expressed at very low levels in Huh7 cells

98

and several human airway cell lines (Clausen et al., 2020) (Figure S1). Yet, our screen with HCoV-

99

229E identified ANPEP (Figure 1C), which encodes the well-known HCoV-229E receptor

100

aminopeptidase N (AP-N). Comparison of the screens pointed towards PIK3C3 and TMEM41B as

101

common genes that were identified for both viruses, and we therefore selected these genes, as well as

102

TMEM106B, for further validation.

113

PI3K type 3 is a druggable target against SARS-CoV-2 and other coronavirus infections

114

PIK3C3 encodes PI3K type 3, the catalytic subunit of the PI3K complex that mediates the formation of

115

phosphatidylinositol 3-phosphate and plays a role in many processes, including endocytic trafficking

116

and the initiation and maturation of autophagosomes (Backer, 2016). Because PIK3C3 is essential for

117

cell survival (https://depmap.org/portal/depmap/), generation of PI3K type 3 null cells for genetical hit

118

validation is not possible. We therefore confirmed the role of this factor in coronavirus infection instead

119

by using the pharmacological inhibitors VPS34-IN1, VPS34-IN2, SAR405, and autophinib, which are

120

structurally distinct inhibitors directly targeting PI3K type 3 (Bago et al., 2014; Pasquier et al., 2015;

121

Robke et al., 2017; Ronan et al., 2014). As expected, all PI3K type 3 inhibitors inhibited the formation

122

of LC3-positive autophagosome puncta and induced large vacuoles in treated cells (Figure S2A) (Ronan

123

et al., 2014). PI3K type 3 inhibitors showed antiviral activity against SARS-CoV-2 in Vero E6 cells

124

(Figure 2A) and Huh7 cells (Figure 2B) and were also active against HCoV-OC43 (Figure 2C) and

125

the more distantly related alphacoronavirus HCoV-229E (Figure 2D). A time series experiment showed

126

that inhibition of HCoV-229E by SAR405 occurs later in the viral life cycle than the attachment stage,

127

as benchmarked by use of the attachment inhibitor UDA, and earlier than onset of intracellular

128

replication as identified by use of remdesivir, an inhibitor of viral RNA synthesis (Figure S2B). This

129

suggests a role of PI3K type 3 in an early step of the viral life cycle, but downstream of receptor binding.

130

Since PI3K type 3 is involved in autophagosome formation, we investigated whether macroautophagy

131

is required for SARS-CoV-2 and HCoV-229E infection. Huh7 cells expressing a pool of four sgRNAs

132

targeting ATG5 or ATG7, which are required for phagophore expansion (Dikic and Elazar, 2018), were

133

unable to form LC3-positive autophagosomes (Figure S2C), indicating that the macroautophagy

134

pathway was disrupted. However, ATG5 and ATG7 disruption did not affect the induction of CPE by

135

SARS-CoV-2 or HCoV-229E (Figure 2E). Together, these results show that SARS-CoV-2 and other

136

coronaviruses employ PI3K type 3 for infection, but do not depend on a functional macroautophagy

137

pathway.

cells expressing pools of 4 sgRNAs targeting ATG5, ATG7, or the AAVS1 safe targeting locus were infected with

151

of the cell viability by MTS assay.

152
153

Validation of TMEM106B, TMEM41B and EXT1 as SARS-CoV-2 or HCoV-229E host factors

154

To validate the findings from our genetic screens, we individually expressed sgRNAs targeting the

155

identified genes, as well as the known receptor genes ANPEP and ACE2, in Huh7 cells and tested

156

whether their abblation affected the sensitivity of cells to CPE induced by HCoV-229E or SARS-CoV-

157

2. sgRNAs targeting ANPEP protected cells from HCoV-229E-induced cell death, as determined by

158

crystal violet staining of surviving cells (Figure 3A). Cells were only partially protected from SARS-

159

CoV-2-induced CPE by sgRNAs targeting ACE2, which is in line with the absence of ACE2 in our

160

screens. This limited effect of ACE2 sgRNAs is probably due to the very low ACE2 expression in the

161

human cell lines used, in contrast to human cell lines engineered to overexpress ACE2 or Vero E6 cells

162

(Figure S1), in which others have found that SARS-CoV-2 infection depends on ACE2 (Wei et al.,

163

2020).

164

TMEM106B sgRNAs were highly enriched in our high stringency SARS-CoV-2 screen. This gene

165

encodes the yet poorly understood protein TMEM106B, which is involved in lysosomal function and

166

implicated in neurodegenerative disorders (Nicholson and Rademakers, 2016). sgRNAs targeting

167

TMEM106B protected Huh7 cells from CPE caused by SARS-CoV-2, even when exposed to high virus

168

concentrations, but had not effect on cells infected with HCoV-229E (Figures 3A and B). In contrast,

169

sgRNAs targeting TMEM41B, which is involved in the early stage of autophagosome formation (Morita

170

et al., 2018), only prevented CPE induced by HCoV-229E, but had no effect on SARS-CoV-2-infected

171

cells in this assay (Figure 3B). This observation, and the fact that TMEM41B was identified only in the

172

low stringency, but not the high stringency SARS-CoV-2 screen (Figure 1C and D), suggests that

173

SARS-CoV-2 only very weakly depends on TMEM41B.

174

Since ACE2 was not identified in our screen, we questioned whether SARS-CoV-2 infection might be

175

supported by other genes known to be involved in virus entry that were enriched in the SARS-CoV-2

176

low stringency screen; ITGB6 and EXT1 (Figure 1B). Both in wildtype Huh7 cells (Figure S3) and

177

cells expressing ACE2 sgRNAs, cells were protected against SARS-CoV-2 by sgRNAs targeting EXT1,

178

which encodes exostosin-1 and is required for the synthesis of heparan sulfate. This observation is in

179

line with a recent report showing that SARS-CoV-2 infection can be mediated by heparan sulfate

180

(Clausen et al., 2020). Taken together, these results point towards a role of heparan sulfate in SARS-

181

CoV-2 infection and identify TMEM41B and TMEM106B as specific host factors for HCoV-229E or

182

SARS-CoV-2 infection, respectively.

TMEM106B is required for SARS-CoV-2 infection in multiple human cell types

196

Our high stringency SARS-CoV-2 screen identified an important role of TMEM106B, a lysosomal

197

protein that has never been implicated as a host factor for any pathogen before. To further corroborate

198

the importance of TMEM106B for SARS-CoV-2 infection, we investigated its role in cell lines other

199

than liver-derived Huh7 cells, including lung derived cell lines. Therefore, we examined several cell

200

lines for susceptibility to SARS-CoV-2-induced CPE and selected the liver-derived cell lines Hep3B

201

and lung-derived cell lines A549, NCI-H1975, and NCI-H2110. We next expressed TMEM106B

202

sgRNAs in these cell lines. TMEM106B sgRNAs protected consistently against CPE caused by SARS-

203

CoV-2 infection in Hep3B, A549, or NCI-H1975 cells, as determined by crystal violet staining (Figure

204

4A). Also NCI-H2110 cells, in which SARS-CoV-2 causes only a very limited CPE, were protected

205

against SARS-CoV-2-induced cell death by sgRNAs targeting TMEM106B, as determined by MTS

206

assay (Figure 4B). To further confirm the role of TMEM106B in SARS-CoV-2 infection, double-

207

stranded RNA intermediates of viral RNA replication were visualized by immunofluorescence staining

208

in infected Hep3B cells containing TMEM106B sgRNAs at 6 hours post infection. TMEM106B sgRNAs

209

reduced the number of SARS-CoV-2-infected Hep3B cells as compared to cells containing control

210

sgRNAs (Figure 4C). In addition, we also observed a reduction in virus progeny released in supernatant

211

of infected NCI-H1975 cells containing TMEM106B sgRNAs as compared to control sgRNAs at 2 days

212

post infection (Figure 4D). To investigate whether TMEM106B is present in relevant cell types in the

213

human airways, we analyzed single cell sequencing data from COVID-19 patients (Chua et al., 2020).

214

This showed that TMEM106B is expressed in ciliated and secretory cells, which are the main SARS-

215

CoV-2 susceptible airway cell types (Chua et al., 2020; Zhu et al.). Together, these results indicate that

216

TMEM106B is required for productive infection of human cell lines of different origins with SARS-

217

CoV-2, and is expressed in relevant cell types in the human airways.

DISCUSSION

236

Although the receptor interactions and proteolytic activation of the SARS-CoV-2 S protein have been

237

extensively studied, little is known about host factors required in following steps of viral infection. Here,

238

we performed genome-wide genetic screens with SARS-CoV-2 and HCoV-229E and identified PI3K

239

type 3 as a host factor shared by both viruses. Moreover, we show that the regulator of autophagy

240

TMEM41B is required for HCoV-229E infection and identified TMEM106B as a new cellular host

241

factor important for SARS-CoV-2 infection.

242

In our SARS-CoV-2 screens we did not identify ACE2, which is in contrast to previous screens

243

performed in Vero E6 cells or engineered human cells overexpressing ACE2 (Heaton et al., 2020; Wei

244

et al., 2020; Zhu et al., 2020). It has been reported that ACE2 overexpression in human cells enhances

245

SARS-CoV-2 infection (Hoffmann et al., 2020; Zhou et al., 2020; Zhu et al., 2020) and that infection is

246

inhibited by ACE2 depletion in Vero E6 cells (Wei et al., 2020). However, to our knowledge, it has not

247

been investigated whether knockout of ACE2 in non-transgenic human cells prevents SARS-CoV-2

248

infection. We observed that all human cell lines tested in this study were susceptible to SARS-CoV-2

249

infection, despite very low levels of ACE2 expression. In addition, we found that heparan sulfate is

250

important for efficient infection, both in wt Huh7 cells and cells expressing ACE2 sgRNAs (Figures 3

251

and S3), which is in line with a recent study showing that heparan sulfate facilitates SARS-CoV-2

252

binding to cells (Clausen et al., 2020). Moreover, another recent study showed that two other human

253

receptor proteins, KREMEN1 and ASGR1, can facilitate infection of SARS-CoV-2 S pseudotyped virus

254

(Gu et al., 2020). Therefore, it is plausible that SARS-CoV-2, alike other viruses, has a broader repertoire

255

of possible (redundant) cellular receptor than initially postulated.

256

PI3K type 3 inhibitors have antiviral activity against SARS-CoV-2, HCoV-229E, and HCoV-OC43, and

257

may therefore have potential to serve as pan-coronavirus inhibitors. Our data (Figure S2B) suggest that

258

PI3K type 3 plays a role in an early step of the viral life cycle, such as endocytosis, fusion, translation

259

or early onset of replication. As recently demonstrated by others, treatment of SARS-CoV-2 infected

260

cells with PI3K type 3 inhibitors causes dispersal of the viral N protein and dsRNA throughout the

261

cytoplasm, suggesting a role of this factor in replication complex formation (Silvas et al., 2020). We

262

showed that disruption of the autophagy genes ATG5 and ATG7, which are required for phagophore

263

expansion, does not negatively impact SARS-CoV-2 and HCoV-229E infection (Figure 2E). Thus, it is

264

possible that PI3K type 3 supports infection by inducing phagophore nucleation, while the later stages

265

of macroautophagy are not required.

266

Importantly, we identified a novel host factor required specifically for SARS-CoV-2 infection.

267

TMEM106B is a 274 amino acid transmembrane protein that resides in endosomes and lysosomes, and

268

controls lysosome size, number, mobility and trafficking. TMEM106B is not well characterized and

269

only recently received attention because of its role in frontotemporal dementia, the second leading cause

270

of pre-senile neurodegeneration after Alzheimer’s disease (Nicholson and Rademakers, 2016).

271

TMEM106B plays a pivotal role in lysosomal acidification, via direct interaction with the proton pump

272

vacuolar-ATPase accessory protein 1 (AP1) (Klein et al., 2017). Therefore, a possible role of

273

TMEM106B might be to promote acidification of vesicles in the endolysosomal pathway, in order to

274

facilitate efficient delivery of the SARS-CoV-2 genome into the cytoplasm. This is in agreement with

275

our finding that TMEM106B plays a role early in the viral replication cycle, i.e. within the first 6 hours

276

after infection (Figure 4C) and with recent findings that entry of SARS-CoV-2 S pseudotyped virus

277

depends on endosomal acidification (Hoffmann et al., 2020; Ou et al., 2020). Interestingly, HCoV-229E

278

also requires endosomal acidification (Blau and Holmes, 2001), but does not require TMEM106B for

279

infection. This suggests that different, though related, viruses may depend on distinct factors to exploit

280

similar cellular pathways. Alternatively, TMEM106B may function as a lysosomal receptor for SARS-

281

CoV-2, similar to the lysosomal receptor NPC1 used by Ebola virus (Carette et al., 2011). Further studies

282

are needed to precisely establish which stage of infection is supported by TMEM106B.

283

As new pathogenic coronaviruses periodically emerge, these viruses will continue to pose a public health

284

threat beyond the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, warranting the development of potent coronavirus

285

inhibitors. Here, we used a genome-wide knockout approach to identify coronavirus host factors in

286

human cells and discovered TMEM106B as a potential new target that might be exploited in the

287

development of drugs to counter the current pandemic or future outbreaks of pathogenic coronaviruses.

asymptomatic patient returning from Wuhan in February 2020. Infectious virus was isolated and

320

multiplied by five serial passages on Huh7 cells. Cells were seeded in DMEM supplemented with 10%

321

heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum to reach a confluency of ~80% the next day. After replacing the

322

medium by DMEM + 2% or 4% fetal bovine serum, cells were infected with SARS-CoV-2 at a MOI of

323

~0.01. When most cells were dying, supernatant was removed from the cells, centrifuged to remove cell

324

debris and stored at -80 °C. The HCoV-229E (ATCC VR-740) and HCoV-OC43 (ATCC VR-1558)

325

virus stocks were obtained by inoculating a confluent monolayer of Huh7 or HRT-18G cells,

326

respectively. The supernatant was harvested after 3 days of incubation for HCoV-229E, or 7 days of

327

incubation for HCoV-OC43, at 35 °C under 5% CO2 and stored in aliquots at −80°C, after one freeze-

328

thaw cycle and removal of cellular debris by centrifugation.

329

Genome-wide knockout screens. For the HCoV-229E and SARS-CoV-2 (high stringency) screens, 1.5

330

x 108 Huh7 cells for each of two replicates were transduced at a MOI of ~0.3 with lentivirus containing

331

the Brunello genome-wide library in lentiCRISPRv2 (Addgene 73179), which contains 77.441 sgRNAs

332

targeting 19.114 genes. Cells were selected with 2 µg/ml puromycin for three days to eliminate

333

untransduced cells, seeded at a coverage of ~200 cells/sgRNA for each replicate and infected with

334

HCoV-229E or SARS-CoV-2. Surviving cells were harvested at 18 days post infection (HCoV-229E)

335

or 41 days post infection (SARS-CoV-2). For the SARS-CoV-2 low stringency screen, 1.5 x 108 Huh7

336

cells for each of two replicates were transduced at a MOI of ~0.2 with lentivirus containing the Brunello

337

library and selected with puromycin for three days. Then, cells were seeded at a coverage of 500

338

cells/sgRNA for each replicate in DMEM with 4% fetal bovine serum and infected with SARS-CoV-2

339

at a MOI of 0.1. For each replicate, uninfected cells were maintained under similar conditions as the

340

infected cells and harvested simultaneously. Five days post infection, cells were cultivated in DMEM

341

with 20% fetal bovine serum for three days to allow cell recovery, and were infected again with a MOI

342

of ~0.1. Cells were harvested at 14 days post infection. Genomic DNA was extracted from cells using

343

the QIAmp DNA Mini Kit (Qiagen ref. 51306) or, for the SARS-CoV-2 low stringency screen with the

344

QIAmp DNA Blood maxi kit (Qiagen ref. 51194). In a first PCR step, regions of ~600 bp containing

345

the sgRNA sequence were amplified using NEBNext Ultra II Q5 Master Mix (NEB #M0544S) in 25

346

amplification cycles. A second PCR of 10 cycles with NEBNext Ultra II Q5 Master Mix was performed

347

with primers containing Illumina adapters and TruSeq indexes. Products were separated by agarose gel

348

electrophoresis and purified with the PureLink Quick Gel Extraction Kit (Thermo Fisher K210012).

349

Samples were then diluted to 2–4 nM, pooled, and denatured and diluted according to the instructions

350

for single-end sequencing on a MiSeq (Illumina) with a MiSeq-v2 50 cycles or a MiSeq-v3-150 cycles

351

kit (Illumina) and 10% PhiX (Illumina) spike-in. FastQ files were further analyzed with CRISPRCloud2

352

(Jeong et al., 2018).

353

Genome-wide knockout screen hit validation via cell viability assays. For individual validation of

354

genes, guides enriched during the genome-wide knockout screens were cloned into the pLentiCRISPRv2

355

plasmid (Addgene 52961) following the standard cloning protocol. For lentiviral particle production,

356

HEK293T cells were plated in 40 mL supplemented DMEM in T150 (TPP) flasks at 45% confluency

357

and incubated overnight. 24 hours later, the cells were transfected using X-TremeGENE 9 (Roche) with

358

the pLentiCRISPR plasmids and the lentiviral packaging plasmids pMD2.G and psPAX2 to generate

359

lentiviral particles coated with the VSV-G protein and incubated overnight. 24 hours post transfection

360

the medium was changed to DMEM supplemented with serum-free BSA growth media (DMEM +

361

1.1g/100mL BSA and 20 µg/mL gentamicin). The supernatant containing lentiviral particles was

362

harvested 72 hours after transfection and stored at -80 °C. Cells were transduced with lentiviruses

363

expressing only one sgRNA or a pool of the 4 sgRNAs from the Brunello genome-wide knockout library

364

and then selected with puromycin for 3 days (sgRNAs target sequences are in Table S1). Cells stably

365

expressing specific sgRNAs were seeded in 96-well plates at 4000 cells/well in medium with 8% or

366

10% fetal bovine serum. The following day, serial dilutions of virus in medium without fetal bovine

367

serum were added to the cells, resulting in a serum concentration of 4% or 5%. Cells were incubated

368

until sufficient CPE was visible. For MTS assays, medium was removed from the cells and replaced by

369

MTS reagent (CellTiter 96 AQueous One Solution Cell Proliferation Assay from Promega, Madison,

370

WI) diluted in PBS. The absorbance was measured with a Tecan Spark microplate reader. For crystal

371

violet staining, cells were fixed in 4% formaldehyde for 30 min, stained with a 1% crystal violet solution

372

in water, and rinsed with water.

373

Virus inhibition assays. The antiviral activity of PI3K type 3 inhibitors on SARS-CoV-2 in Vero E6

374

cells was evaluated as follows: on day -1, the test compounds were serially diluted in DMEM (Gibco

375

cat no 41965-039) supplemented with 2% v/v heat-inactivated FCS and sodium bicarbonate (Gibco

376

25080-060). Diluted compounds were then mixed with EGFP-expressing Vero E6 cells at 25,000

377

cells/well in 96-well plates (Greiner Bio-One, Vilvoorde, Belgium; Catalog 655090). The plates were

378

incubated overnight in a humidified incubator at 37°C and 5% CO2. On day 0, SARS-CoV-2 was added

379

at 20 TCID50/well and on day 4 post infection, the wells were examined for EGFP expression using a

380

high-content imaging platform and the images of the wells were converted into signal values. To obtain

381

values for antiviral activity, the background signal was subtracted based on infected-untreated controls

382

and signal values were normalized to uninfected-untreated controls. Toxicity of compounds in the

383

absence of virus was evaluated by MTS assay. All compounds were tested in duplicate, in two

384

independent experiments. To evaluate the antiviral activity of PI3K type 3 inhibitors against HCoV-

385

229E, Huh7 cells were seeded into 384-well plates. The next day, serial dilutions of the compounds

386

were added to the cells prior to infection with HCoV-229E at 30 TCID50 (50% tissue culture infective

387

doses) per well. At 3 days post infection, the virus-induced CPE was measured by MTS assay. The

388

compounds were tested in at least four independent experiments.

389

Time of drug addition assay. Huh-7 cells were seeded into 48-well dishes at 40,000 cells per well.

390

After 24 hours of incubation at 37°C, the cells were cooled on ice for 1 hour, followed by addition of 30

391

CCID50 of the HCoV-229E virus and further incubation at 35°C. The test compounds were added at a

392

concentration approximately 10-fold above their EC50, at different time points post infection (-30 min,

393

0h, 30 min, 1h, 2h, 3h, 5h and 8h p.i.). At 11 h p.i., total cellular RNA extracts were prepared and viral

Amplification and detection were performed in an ABI 7500 Fast Sequence Detection System (Applied

401

Biosystems, Foster City, CA, USA) under the following conditions: an initial reverse transcription at

402

50 °C for 15 min, followed by PCR activation at 95 °C for 2 min and 45 cycles of amplification (15 s at

403

95 °C and 30 s at 60 °C). Six independent experiments were carried out.

404

Immunofluorescence assays. Immunofluorescence staining was performed according to standard

405

procedures. Briefly, all cells were seeded at a density of 20.000 cells per well in 8-well µ-slides (Ibidi).

406

Cells were allowed to adhere overnight before receiving compound treatment and/or viral infection with

407

SARS-CoV-2 or HCoV-OC43. After incubation, cells were fixed (4% PFA in PBS), washed and

408

permeabilized (0.2% Triton X-100 in PBS). Employed primary antibodies were rabbit anti-LC3B

409

(L7543, Sigma) at a 1:200 dilution and mouse anti-dsRNA (J2, Scicons) at a 1:1000 dilution. Secondary

410

antibodies Alexa Fluor® 568 goat anti-rabbit (A11011, Invitrogen, ThermoFisher Scientific) and Alexa

411

Fluor® 488 goat anti-mouse (A11029, Invitrogen, ThermoFisher Scientific) were diluted 1:500. Cell

412

nuclei were counterstained with DAPI and the samples were imaged by confocal microscopy on a Leica

413

TCS SP5 confocal microscope (Leica Microsystems), employing a HCX PL APO 63x (NA 1.2) water

414

immersion objective. The percentage of infected cells was quantified by high content image analysis

415

(ArrayScan XTI, ThermoFisher Scientific) for at least 3000 cells per condition.

Generation of ACE2 overexpressing Huh7 cells. The pLCKO plasmid was a gift from Jason Moffat

417

(Addgene plasmid #73311). The invariant gRNA scaffold was removed together with the puromycin

418

resistance gene and replaced with ACE2 (Addgene Plasmid #1786) followed by a P2A-coupled

419

blasticidin resistance gene driven by a cytomegalovirus promotor. The resulting pLCKO-ACE2-P2A-

420

Blasticidin vector was used to make lentiviral particles, as described above. Huh7 cells were transduced

421

with a the lentiviral stock in the presence of polybrene (8 µg/ml). After 24 hours medium was replaced

422

with medium containing Blasticidin (10 ug/ml) and cells were incubated for an additional 48 hours.

423

Simple Western analysis. For Simple Western analysis, cells were lysed in RIPA lysis buffer (Sigma)

424

for 1 hour at 4 °C. Whole cell lysates were cleared by centrifugation. Proteins were separated by size

447

ATG7, or the AAVS1 safe targeting locus. Chloroquine, an inhibitor of autophagic flux that decreases

448

autophagosome-lysosome fusion, induces an increase in LC3-positive puncta in control cells, but fails

449

to do so in ATG5 and ATG7 knockout cells, confirming the effective knockout of both genes (bar: 25

450

µm).

455

with a dilution series of SARS-CoV-2 and incubated for three days at 35 °C, followed by measurement
