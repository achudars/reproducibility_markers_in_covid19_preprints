Abstract

35

Serological and plasmablast responses and plasmablast-derived IgG monoclonal

36

antibodies (MAbs) have been analysed in three COVID-19 patients with different

37

clinical severities. Potent humoral responses were detected within 3 weeks of onset of

38

illness in all patients and the serological titre was elicited soon after or concomitantly

39

with peripheral plasmablast response. An average of 13.7% and 13.0% of

40

plasmablast-derived MAbs were reactive with virus spike glycoprotein or

41

nucleocapsid, respectively. A subset of anti-spike (10 of 32) and over half of anti-

42

nucleocapsid (19 of 35) antibodies cross-reacted with other betacoronaviruses tested

43

and harboured extensive somatic mutations, indicative of an expansion of memory B

44

cells upon SARS-CoV-2 infection. Fourteen of 32 anti-spike MAbs, including five

45

anti-RBD, three anti-non-RBD S1 and six anti-S2, neutralised wild-type SARS-CoV-2

46

in independent assays. Anti-RBD MAbs were further grouped into four cross-

47

inhibiting clusters, of which six antibodies from three separate clusters blocked the

48

binding of RBD to ACE2 and five were neutralising. All ACE2-blocking anti-RBD

49

antibodies were isolated from two patients with prolonged fever, which is compatible

50

with substantial ACE2-blocking response in their sera. At last, the identification of

51

non-competing pairs of neutralising antibodies would offer potential templates for the

52

development of prophylactic and therapeutic agents against SARS-CoV-2.

Introduction

54

In late 2019, a novel coronavirus emerged and was identified as the cause of a cluster

55

of respiratory infection cases in Wuhan, China. It spread quickly around the world. In

56

March of 2020 a pandemic was declared by the World Health Organization, the virus

57

was formally named as Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-

58

CoV-2) and the resulting disease was named COVID-19. As of 1 October 2020, there

59

have been over 33 million confirmed cases of SARS-CoV-2 infection with 1,010,986

60

deaths (World Health Organization, https://covid19.who.int/).

61

There is no fully effective drug or licenced vaccine for COVID-19. Antibodies

62

neutralise SARS-CoV-2 in vitro, offering hope that a vaccine may induce a protective

63

response, and antibodies may be an effective treatment for COVID-19 in clinical

64

practice. Convalescent plasma is being tested in ongoing clinical trials as a therapy for

65

COVID-19 (1, 2), and was previously used in the treatment of SARS (3). The virus

66

spike glycoprotein is a target of neutralising antibodies, which makes it a key

67

candidate for both vaccine development and immunotherapy (4). B cell responses in

68

COVID-19 patients have been detected concomitantly with follicular helper T cell

69

responses from week one after illness onset (5). In SARS patients, B cell responses

70

typically arise first against the nucleocapsid protein then, within four to eight days

71

after symptom onset, antibody responses to spike glycoprotein have been found;

72

neutralising antibody responses begin to develop by week two, and most patients

73

develop neutralising antibodies by week three (6). Two serological studies of COVID-

74

19 patients showed anti-SARS-CoV-2 IgG seroconversion at week three after onset

75

and some cross-reactivity to nucleocapsid of SARS (7, 8).

76

Antibodies may play a role in protection against SARS-CoV-2 infection. The

77

underlying B-cell response leading to the rapid production of plasmablasts (antibody-

78

secreting cells) that secrete antibodies upon natural SARS-CoV-2 exposure/infection

79

is only beginning to be understood (5). Here, we characterised the infection-induced

80

serological and plasmablast responses and the derived IgG anti-SARS-CoV-2 spike

81

glycoprotein and nucleocapsid monoclonal antibodies (MAbs) from adult patients

82

with laboratory-confirmed COVID-19. The antigenic specificity and breadth of

83

antibodies and the sequence of their variable domains have been characterised in

84

detail. Virus neutralising antibodies were detected that bound epitopes on receptor-

85

binding domain (RBD), non-RBD regions of the S1 polypeptide, and the S2

86

polypeptide of the spike glycoprotein.

Results

88

Serological response and anti-spike glycoprotein and anti-nucleocapsid IgG

89

antibodies from circulating plasmablasts

90

Serum IgG antibodies to the virus spike glycoprotein and the isolated RBD were

91

analysed by indirect enzyme-linked immunosorbent and flow cytometry assays in

92

three patients with laboratory-confirmed COVID-19. The clinical characteristics of

93

the three patients studied are shown in Supplemental Table 1. Antibodies to spike

94

glycoprotein and RBD were detected in all three patients after week 3 of illness onset

95

(Figure 1a). Case A showed a robust response to spike glycoprotein and the isolated

96

RBD by day (D) 22 (D22). Longitudinal sera from case B and C showed lower anti-

97

spike glycoprotein and RBD IgG titres at week 1 or the beginning of week 2 and an

98

elevated titre that peaked at the end of week 2 through week 3 (a peak 50% effective

99

dilution (ED50) titre to RBD 1:1,051 at D18 in case B and 1:588 at D14 in case C).

100

Case B had prolonged fever and developed pneumonia at the end of week 2, which

101

was followed by a robust increase of anti-spike glycoprotein and RBD IgG titres at

102

week 3 (Figure 1a, Supplemental Table 1). By contrast, case C experienced a two-day

103

course of febrile illness and reduction of all symptoms within the first week, followed

104

by anti-spike glycoprotein and RBD IgG titres that peaked earlier at the end of week 2

105

(Figure 1a, Supplemental Table 1).

106

An increased frequency of circulating plasmablasts was detected in all three patients

107

(healthy adults baseline less than 1%) (5) (Figure 1b). In case A, a plasmablast

108

response containing a substantial IgG subset was detected at the end of week 2 (D14),

109

followed by a high serological titre at week 3 (D22). Case B had a robust plasmablast

110

response at the end of week 2 (D14) but the IgG plasmablast subset continued to rise,

111

dominated at week 3 (D18), but then subsided at the beginning of week 4 (D22),

112

which is compatible with high anti-spike glycoprotein and RBD IgG serological titres

113

at week 3. Case C produced a significant early plasmablast response at the end of

114

week 1 (D6), the IgG plasmablast subset dominated at the same time, and both the

115

plasmablast response and its IgG subsets subsided at the end of week 2 (D14).

116

Circulating plasmablasts were identified and used to generate human IgG monoclonal

117

antibodies (MAbs) from the three patients (Figure 2a). A total of 219 plasmablast-

118

derived IgG MAbs were produced, of which 67 (10 of 50 from case A, 48 of 131 from

119

case B, 9 of 38 from case C) were shown to bind spike glycoprotein or nucleocapsid

120

antigens of SARS-CoV-2 by one or more of the following: staining of spike

121

glycoprotein and RBD-expressing cells, ELISA, or immunofluorescence and specific

122

virus neutralisation. Averages of 13.7±6.8% (6.0-18.4%) and 13.0±7.3% (5.3-19.9%)

123

of plasmablast-derived IgG MAbs were reactive with virus spike glycoprotein and

124

nucleocapsid, respectively.

125

Genetic and phenotypic characteristics of anti-spike glycoprotein antibodies

126

Among 32 anti-spike MAbs, 10 bound to the RBD, 13 to non-RBD S1, and the other

127

9 to the S2 subunit of the SARS-CoV-2 spike glycoprotein (Figure 2a and Table 1).

observed for a subset (4 of 9) of anti-S2 MAbs with full-length spike glycoprotein

135

Ten of 32 anti-SARS-CoV-2 spike glycoprotein MAbs cross-reacted with the

136

glycoproteins of other betacoronaviruses, including SARS, MERS or human common

137

cold coronavirus OC43 in ELISA (Table 1), suggesting the presence of conserved

138

epitopes on the spike glycoproteins of betacoronaviruses.

139

Each of 32 anti-spike glycoprotein MAbs was encoded by a unique set of heavy chain

140

VDJ and light chain VJ rearrangements in the variable domain (Supplemental Table

141

2). Fourteen of 32 SARS-CoV-2 spike-reactive MAb genes possessed low numbers of

142

somatic mutations resulting in 0 or 1 amino acid substitutions suggesting a de novo B

143

cell response to the SARS-CoV-2 virus in humans. Six of the 32 MAb genes

144

possessed ≥ 20 nucleotide mutations, and these cross-reacted on other beta-

145

coronaviruses, including OC43. Of the nine anti-S2 antibodies five cross-reacted on

146

OC43 virus and three of these also cross-reacted on MERS (Table 1). All five cross-

147

reactive anti-S2 antibodies had high rates of somatic mutation (25±5), indicating a

148

memory phenotype, and three of the five were neutralising to a moderate level (half

149

maximal effective concentration, EC50, 36-133.33 nM, Table 1).

150

The CDR3 length varied among anti-spike glycoprotein antibodies (Supplemental

151

Table 2). No significant differences were found between anti-S2 and anti-S1 or anti-

152

RBD subsets. Among anti-S2 MAbs, a significantly longer heavy chain CDR3 length

153

was found in the cross-reactive group compared to the specific group (Cross-reactive

154

20±2 versus Specific 12±4, p= 0.02, two-tailed Mann-Whitney test; Figure 2c),

155

indicating that a long CDR3 may play a role in antigen binding, which is also found in

156

several broadly reactive human MAbs against human immunodeficiency virus and

157

influenza virus (9, 10).

158

The binding activities of 10 anti-RBD MAbs were further characterised in detail.

159

Using MDCK-SIAT1 cells transduced to express the RBD and flow cytometry,

160

binding activities of the anti-RBD MAbs were shown to vary with 50% binding

161

concentration from 0.10 to 1.83 µg/ml (Supplemental Figure 2). The MAbs with

162

strong anti-RBD binding have a relatively long heavy chain CDR3 length (50%

163

binding concentration <0.5 µg/ml versus >0.5 µg/ml, p=0.03, two-tailed Mann-

164

Whitney test; Supplemental Figure 3).

165

Neutralisation by anti-spike glycoprotein antibodies

166

The optimum method for detecting neutralisation of SARS-CoV-2 has not been

167

established. For example, different laboratories have obtained varying results for the

168

well-defined monoclonal antibody CR3022 (11-13). We have therefore obtained

169

results from neutralisation assays performed in independent laboratories: a systematic

170

survey of the thirty two anti-spike MAbs at the Francis Crick Institute (London), with

171

follow up for a selection of MAbs at the Sir William Dunn School (Oxford) and

172

Chang Gung Memorial Hospital (Taiwan).

173

The 32 anti-spike glycoprotein MAbs were systematically examined by plaque

174

reduction neutralisation (PRNT) assay for neutralisation of wild type SARS-CoV-2

175

virus (see methods; summarised in Table 1). A total of 14 neutralising antibodies

176

distributed between different regions of the spike glycoprotein were identified: 5 of 10

177

to RBD, 3 of 13 to S1 (non-RBD), 6 of 9 to S2. The EC50 concentrations, as a

178

measure of potency, ranged from 0.05 to ~133 nM (8 ng/ml - ~20 µg/ml).

179

Neutralisation of anti-RBD antibodies was corroborated by a microneutralisation test

180

that measured a reduction in fluorescent focus-forming units (see methods,

181

Supplemental Figure 4). MAbs were also tested by a PCR-based neutralisation assay

182

(see methods): inhibition of virus replication was measured by quantitative PCR in the

183

supernatant bathing the infected cells. This results corroborated that anti-RBD FD

184

11A, anti-RBD FI 3A, anti-RBD FD 5D, anti-RBD EY 6A and anti-S2 EW 9C, as

185

crude culture supernatants, reduced the virus signal from ~56- to ~10,085-fold

186

(Supplemental Figure 5).

187

ACE2 blockade by anti-RBD antibodies

188

Potent neutralising antibodies to the RBD of SARS-CoV-2 spike glycoprotein were

189

identified and we thus analyse the blockade of the ACE2-RBD interaction by anti-

190

RBD antibodies in two assays (Figure 3, Table 1), including an assay that we reported

191

previously (14, 15). In the first assay unlabelled MAbs in at least 10-fold excess were

192

mixed with biotin labelled ACE2-Fc and binding to the RBD, displayed on RBD-VLP

193

(16) bound to an ELISA plate (Figure 3a, Supplemental Figure 6). Anti-RBD

194

neutralising antibodies FI 3A and FI 1C, as well as the unlabelled ACE2-Fc, strongly

195

inhibited the binding of labelled ACE2-Fc to RBD. A partial inhibition was detected

196

by anti-RBD antibodies FD 11A, FD 5D and FI 4A. Another unlabelled nanobody

197

VHH72-Fc in excess inhibited the binding of labelled ACE2-Fc to RBD in this assay.

198

The structure of VHH72-Fc bound to RBD is known (17) and its footprint on the

199

RBD does not overlap that of ACE2, so inhibition is thought to occur by steric

200

hindrance.

201

In the second assay, we employed MDCK-SIAT1 cells overexpressing full-length

202

human ACE2 as a transmembrane protein. Unlabelled antibodies or ACE2-Fc were

203

mixed in excess with biotinylated RBD, and binding of RBD was detected with

204

Streptavidin-HRP in ELISA (Figure 3b). The results of this assay mostly mirrored

205

those of the first assay and confirmed that in this orientation anti-RBD neutralising

206

antibodies FD 11A and FD 5D competed in excess with soluble RBD for binding to

207

ACE2 (Figure 3b). In addition, anti-RBD neutralising antibody EY 6A competed with

208

RBD for ACE2 binding. The binding pattern of EY 6A is analogous to a previously

209

described antibody CR3022 (Table 1) (11). These two antibodies are known to bind to

210

the same region of RBD away from the ACE2 binding site, but they influence the

211

binding kinetics of RBD to ACE2, presumably through steric effects (15).

212

Division of anti-RBD antibodies into cross-inhibiting groups

213

The ten anti-RBD MAbs were then divided into cross-inhibiting groups as described

214

for human MAbs to Ebola (18) by assessing competition of unlabelled antibodies at

215

10-fold (or greater) excess over a biotin labelled target antibody by ELISA. Included

216

as controls were the VHH72-Fc (17) and H11-H4-Fc (14) nanobodies linked to the

217

hinge and Fc region of human IgG1, CR3022 and S309 human MAbs (11, 19)

218

reconstituted as an IgG1 antibody. These four control molecules have characterised

219

binding footprints on the RBD defined by crystal structures (12, 14, 17, 19), as does

220

EY 6A (15). Also included was the protease domain (residues 18-615) of ACE2 linked

221

to the Fc region of human IgG1 (ACE2-Fc dimer).

222

The ten antibodies formed four cross-inhibiting clusters (Table 2), represented by

223

antibodies EY 6A (cluster 1, which included CR3022), FI 3A (cluster 2, which

224

included H11-H4), FD 11A (cluster 3, which included S309) and FJ 10B (cluster 4).

225

The strongest inhibitors of ACE2-Fc binding were in clusters 2 and 3 (Tables 1 and 2).

226

Neutralising antibodies were detected in clusters 1, 2 and 3, with the strongest

227

antibodies FI 3A and FD 11A being in clusters 2 and 3 (Tables 1 and 2).

228

Neutralising antibodies to RBD and relationship to ACE2 blockade

229

Five neutralising anti-RBD MAbs partially or completely blocked the interaction

230

between RBD and ACE2 (Tables 1 and 2, Figure 3). The most potent neutralising

231

antibodies were ACE2 blockers (FI 3A in cluster 2, and FD 11A in cluster 3), and

232

bound independently of each other to the RBD (Figure 3c). MAb EY 6A has been

233

shown to alter the binding kinetics of the interaction without full inhibition (15) and it

234

had a moderate effect on ACE2 binding in the assay where ACE2 was expressed at the

235

cell surface. These three MAbs bound independently of each other indicating the

236

existence of at least three neutralisation-sensitive epitopes within the RBD (Figure

237

3c). All five neutralising MAbs to the RBD (EY 6A, FI 3A, FI 1C, FD 11A, FD 5A)

238

had V gene sequences close to germline (Supplemental Table 2), indicating the

239

development of de novo anti-RBD antibodies upon natural SARS-CoV-2 infection in

240

humans.

241

The ability of convalescent sera to block soluble RBD for binding to cell-expressed

242

ACE2 was assessed. Both convalescent sera from case A (D22) and case B (D26)

243

exhibited detectable ACE2-blocking activities (Figure 3d). This serological activity is

244

compatible with the isolation of potent ACE2-blocking antibodies from both patients

245

(Table 1). By contrast, the D18 serum from case C showed minimal ACE2-blocking

246

activity. Both cases A and B had prolonged fever and the development of pneumonia

247

during hospitalization (Supplemental Table 1), which suggests that the development

248

of ACE2-blocking antibody response in the convalescent stage is likely associated

249

with clinical severity after infection.

250

Neutralising antibodies to S2

251

Six of nine MAbs specific for S2 showed moderate neutralisation in the PRNT assay

252

(Table 1). The antibodies FB 1E, FJ 4E and EW 9C, are moderately neutralising (EC50

253

36-133.33 nM), cross-react on the spike glycoprotein from the common cold

254

betacoronavirus OC43, and show sequence characteristics of memory cells with high

255

numbers of somatic mutations. This indicates that memory B cells, likely primed by

256

an endemic or epidemic betacoronavirus related to OC43, can give rise to antibodies

257

that neutralise SARS-CoV-2, albeit modestly. The other three neutralising antibodies

258

specific for S2, FD 10A, FG 7A and FM 1A were close to germline in sequence

259

(Supplemental Table 2) and did not cross-react strongly with other betacoronaviruses

260

(Table 1). FD 10A exhibits the most potent neutralising activity in the PRNT assay

261

and also completely inhibits SARS-CoV-2-induced cytopathic effect (see methods) at

262

8.33 nM.

263

Neutralising antibodies to non-RBD S1

264

Thirteen MAbs were defined that bound the S1 region and three, close to germline in

265

sequence, were neutralising. FJ 1C showed strong neutralisation (EC50 55.5 nM),

266

whilst FD 11E (EC50 70 nM) and FD 1E (EC50 110 nM) were moderately neutralising

267

(Table 1). We investigated the specificity of these antibodies using flow cytometry

268

with MDCK-SIAT1 cells expressing the N-terminal domain (NTD) of spike

269

glycoprotein linked to the transmembrane and cytoplasmic region of influenza

270

haemagglutinin (see methods). FJ 1C (neutralising) and FD 7C bound strongly to this

NTD construct defining them as NTD-specific (Table 1, Supplemental Figure 7).

Characterisation of anti-nucleocapsid antibodies

273

A set of 35 anti-SARS-CoV-2 nucleocapsid MAbs were derived from circulating

274

plasmablasts in the naturally infected subjects (Table 3, Supplemental Figure 8); 19 of

275

these strongly cross-react with at least one of the betacoronaviruses tested, 17 with

276

SARS CoV, 14 with OC43 virus, and 13 with MERS CoV in ELISA. This suggested

277

extensive cross-reactivity of the antibody response to epitopes in nucleocapsids of

278

betacoronaviruses following natural infection with SARS-CoV-2.

279

The 35 MAbs were evolved from 33 clonal groups defined by their heavy chain VDJ

280

and light chain VJ rearrangements (Supplemental Table 3). Those cross-reactive with

281

other betacoronaviruses carried considerably more amino acid substitutions than

282

SARS-CoV-1-specific MAbs in their variable domains (CR heavy 22±15 versus

283

specific heavy 9±11, p=0.008, two-tailed Mann-Whitney test; Figure 2d), supporting

284

the interpretation that approximately 50% of the anti-nucleocapsid antibody response

285

in these three patients was derived from memory B cells, presumably primed by

286

betacoronaviruses endemic to humans and related to OC43.

Discussion

288

We detected a robust and rapid plasmablast response encoding diverse anti-spike

289

glycoprotein and anti-nucleocapsid antibody populations within 3 weeks of onset of

290

illness in COVID-19 patients. The concomitant serologic response occurred as early

291

as the first week after illness onset, with gradually increasing levels of SARS-CoV-2

292

spike glycoprotein- and RBD-binding IgG antibodies from the second to third week

293

after symptom onset. The kinetics of plasmablast and virus-specific serologic

294

responses was observed to vary between subjects. Consecutive samples from donor B

295

showed a highly expanded plasmablast subset at the time of progression into

296

pneumonia, followed by class-switching to an IgG-predominant plasmablast response

297

until week three of illness. On the other hand, donor C presented with mild symptoms

298

and produced an early plasmablast response with class-switching at the end of first

299

week of symptom onset. Thevarajan et al demonstrated a similar kinetic of B cell

300

response in a mild COVID-19 case, in whom the peripheral plasmablast response and

301

the SARS-CoV-2-binding IgG antibodies peaked at day eight, soon after the

302

disappearance of fever (5). An early class-switching phenotype of the humoral

303

response was also noted within the first week of onset in paediatric patients who

304

mainly experienced mild illness after SARS-CoV-2 infection, although the

305

immunological basis for this phenotype is unclear (20). Both peak plasmablast

306

frequency and serologic titre for spike glycoprotein were higher in donor B, who

307

presented with severe symptoms, than in donor C. Similar observations on the

308

serologic titre and clinical severity have been reported by others (7, 21).

309

In this study, a substantial subset of plasmablast-derived anti-S2 (five of nine, 56%)

310

and anti-nucleocapsid antibodies (14 of 35, 40%) cross-reacted with human

15

311

betacoronavirus OC43. Cross-reactivity among betacoronaviruses has also been

312

reported in polyclonal sera (22, 23). Human coronavirus OC43, discovered in the

313

1960s, is one of the major betacoronaviruses that cause common colds in the

314

community

315

immunocompromised individuals (23, 26). Epidemiologic surveys reveal that OC43

316

infection can occur in early childhood, and that OC43 seropositivity reaches nearly

317

90% in adults (27, 28). The S2 component of SARS-CoV-2 spike glycoprotein shares

318

43~89% amino acid identity with SARS, MERS and OC43, and, similarly, the amino

319

acid sequence of SARS-CoV-2 nucleocapsid protein of is 34~90% homologous to

320

those of other betacoronaviruses (Supplemental Figures 9 and 10), suggesting the

321

presence of conserved epitopes on these antigens.

322

The presence of pre-existing immune memory to betacoronavirus that cross-react with

323

SARS-CoV-2 is supported by the accumulation of somatic mutations in the genes

324

encoding cross-reactive antibodies isolated from COVID-19 patients (Figures 2c and

325

2d, Supplemental Tables 2 and 3). This situation is reminiscent of re-exposure to

326

immunogenic epitopes shared by closely related viruses leading to induction of

327

broadly cross-reactive antibodies in patients infected with influenza, dengue or Zika

328

viruses (29-31).

329

The 32 MAbs that bound to the spike glycoprotein were systematically tested for

330

neutralisation (summarised in Table 1). Results established that neutralising epitopes

331

were present on the RBD, S1-NTD, S1-non NTD/RBD, and S2 regions of the spike

332

glycoprotein. The range of neutralisation EC50 titres against live SARS-CoV-2

333

reported in the literature for human and murine monoclonal antibodies span at least

334

three orders of magnitude, from ng/ml to µg/ml (32, 33). Our results reflect the range

335

of values in in vitro potency. The relationship between the EC50 value in neutralisation

336

assays and therapeutic potential is not established, although antibodies to the RBD

337

with EC50 in the nanogram range have shown therapeutic activity in small animal

338

models (34-36). The majority of the most strongly neutralising antibodies were close

339

to germline in sequence, showing that full affinity maturation is not required in order

340

to achieve SARS-CoV-2 virus neutralisation. We made a similar observation for

341

antibodies induced by an Ebola vaccine (18), and this has been observed in other

342

collections of monoclonal antibodies to SARS-CoV-2 (4, 33-40).

343

The RBDs of SARS and SARS-CoV-2 are known to contain neutralising epitopes (15,

344

32-42), and vaccines based on the RBD of SARS and SARS-CoV-2 induce strong

345

neutralising antibodies that are protective in animal models (43-45). There is a

346

tendency for the most potent neutralising antibodies to be those that block the binding

347

of the RBD to its receptor ACE2 (32-42, 46-48). Previous structural studies

348

demonstrated that potent antibodies with footprints overlapping that of ACE2 are

349

composed of two major subgroups, one with representative Vh3-53 gene usage and

350

short CDR3 binding to the RBD in an up conformation and the other binding RBDs in

351

both up and down conformations and even adjacent RBDs (49, 50). Potent MAb FI

352

3A shares similar characteristics with the first subgroup described above. Occasional

353

antibodies that do not occupy the ACE2 footprint or weakly block ACE2 binding, i.e.

354

S309, CR3022 and EY6A, can be almost as potent, perhaps through spike trimer

355

cross-linking or triggering a conformational change in the spike glycoprotein that

356

renders it non-functional (4, 15, 19, 40).

357

We characterise ten MAbs targeting the RBD that can be arranged into four cross-

358

inhibiting clusters (Table 2). Three of these MAb clusters (represented by EY 6A, FI

17

bioRxiv preprint doi: https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.08.28.267526; this version posted October 19, 2020. The copyright holder for this preprint

359

3A and FD 11A) demonstrate neutralisation of SARS-CoV-2 to some level, while

360

those in the fourth (represented by FM 7B) did not neutralise. This suggests that three

361

neutralising antibodies may be able to bind to the RBD simultaneously. The most

362

potent neutralising MAbs fall in two clusters and interfere strongly with ACE2

363

binding, which may be exploited therapeutically. For instance, antibodies FI 3A in

364

cluster 2 (EC50 8.67 nM) and FD 11A in cluster 3 (EC50 0.05 nM) could be combined

365

to limit possible selection of neutralisation-resistant variants. This principle has been

366

demonstrated in recent studies (36, 38, 51).

367

Neutralisation by human MAbs to the S1-NTD of SARS-CoV-2 has been described

368

(35, 52), but their mechanism of action is not known. The range of neutralising EC50

369

titres (0.09-51.1 nM) was overlapping with those targeting the RBD, similar to our

370

NTD-specific antibody FJ 1C. Cocktails of antibodies that include a representative to

371

the NTD would further reduce the likelihood of selecting neutralisation-resistant

372

viruses. A second strong binder to the NTD, FD 7C, was not neutralising. Structural

373

comparisons of these two antibodies bound to spike glycoprotein may provide insight

374

into the neutralising action of FJ 1C.

375

We detected a subset of six MAbs to the S2 region of the spike glycoprotein that

376

neutralised moderately (EC50 36-133 nM). Three of these were clearly derived from a

377

memory population; showing significant accumulation of somatic mutations in the

378

MAb encoding genes and cross-reactivity for the OC43 common cold virus spike

379

glycoprotein (Figure 2c). Further investigation is required to ascertain whether such

380

antibodies, that may be weak- or non-neutralising and cross-reactive with common

381

cold viruses, are beneficial or detrimental with respect to COVID-19 disease.

382

Our results have significance for serologic tests employing the N and S2 antigens of

383

SARS-CoV-2. Serologic surveys, some of which are based on these antigens, with

384

sera from donors infected with SARS-COV-2 during the spring and summer months

385

have shown very high specificity (as judged by comparing convalescent sera from

386

COVID-19

387

period)(www.gov.uk/government/publications/covid-19-laboratory-evaluations-of-

388

serological-assays). However, if many individuals have memory B cells to S2 and N

389

antigens of circulating betacoronaviruses that cross-react with SARS-CoV-2,

390

concurrent winter infections with these viruses might erode the specificity of

391

serologic tests for SARS-CoV-2 based on these two antigens. Cross-reactivity of

392

antibodies targeting the S1 subunit is relatively lower, so using this antigen is more

393

likely to give a true indication of SARS-CoV-2 specificity.

394

In summary, COVID-19 patients developed strong anti-SARS-CoV-2 spike

395

glycoprotein and nucleocapsid plasmablast and antibody responses. A panel of IgG

396

MAbs targeted a diverse spectrum of epitopes on the RBD, S1-NTD, non-NTD/RBD

397

S1 and S2 regions of the spike glycoprotein, of which 14 neutralised wild type virus

398

with EC50s in the range 0.05 to ~133 nM. Neutralising activities of the majority of

399

anti-RBD MAbs were linked to ACE2-binding blockade, and non-competing pairs of

400

such MAbs, perhaps combined with a neutralising MAb to the NTD, offer potential

401

formulations for the development of prophylactic and therapeutic agents against

402

SARS-CoV-2. Antibody responses to nucleocapsid and the S2 component of spike

403

glycoprotein confirm marked cross-reactivity with a common cold virus.

405

Study design

406

This study was designed to isolate SARS-CoV-2 antigen-specific MAbs from

407

peripheral plasmablasts of humans infected with SARS-CoV-2 and to characterise the

408

antigenic specificity and phenotypic activities of the MAbs. Diagnosis of SARS-CoV-

409

2 infection was based on positive real-time reverse transcriptase polymerase chain

410

reaction results of respiratory samples. The study protocol and informed consent were

411

approved by the ethics committee at the Chang Gung Medical Foundation and the

Production of human IgG 1 monoclonal antibodies

428

Sorted single cells were used to produce human IgG MAbs as previously described

429

(53). Briefly, the variable region genes from each single cell were amplified in a

430

reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR: QIAGEN, Germany) using

431

a cocktail of sense primers specific for the leader region and antisense primers to the

432

Cγ constant region for heavy chain and Cκ and Cλ for light chain. The RT-PCR

433

products were amplified in separate polymerase chain reactions for the individual

434

heavy and light chain gene families using nested primers to incorporate restriction

435

sites at the ends of the variable gene as previously described (53). These variable

436

genes were then cloned into expression vectors for the heavy and light chains.

437

Plasmids were transfected into the HEK293T cell line for expression of recombinant

438

full-length human IgG MAbs in serum-free transfection medium. A selected panel of

439

MAbs were further expanded and purified.

440

To determine the individual gene segments employed by VDJ and VJ rearrangements

441

and the number of nucleotide mutations and amino acid replacements, the variable

442

domain sequences were aligned with germline gene segments using the international

443

ImMunoGeneTics (IMGT) alignment tool (http://www.imgt.org/IMGT_vquest/input).

534

described. The cycle threshold values of real-time RT-PCR were used as indicators of

535

the copy number of SARS-CoV-2 RNA in samples with lower cycle threshold values

536

corresponding to higher virus copy numbers.

537

CPE-based neutralisation assay

538

Vero E6 cells in Dulbecco’s Modified Eagle’s Medium containing 10% FBS were

539

added into 96-well plates and incubated at 37°C with 5% CO2 overnight to reach

540

confluence. After washing with virus growth medium (VGM: Dulbecco’s Modified

541

Eagle’s Medium containing 2% FBS), two-fold serially diluted MAbs in VGM

542

starting at 100 µg/ml were added to each duplicated well. The plates were

543

immediately transferred to a BSL-3 laboratory and 100 TCID50 SARS-CoV-2 (hCoV-

544

19/Taiwan/4/2020, EPI_ISL_411927) in VGM was added. The plates were further

545

incubated at 37°C with 5% CO2 for three days and the cytopathic morphology of the

546

cells was recorded using an ImageXpress Nano Automated Cellular Imaging System.

548

Competitive binding assays were performed as described previously (18) with slight

549

modifications for epitope mapping of the anti-RBD MAbs. Briefly, 0.5 μg/ml of

550

RBD-VLP were coated on NUNC plates (50 μl per well) overnight at 4ºC, washed

551

and blocked with 300 μl of 5% (w/v) dried skimmed milk in PBS for 1 hour at room

552

temperature prior to the assays. Antibody was biotinylated using EZ-Link Sulfo-NHS-

553

LC-biotin (21237; Life Technologies) and then mixed with competing MAb (in at

554

least 10-fold excess) and transferred to the blocked NUNC plates for 1 hour. A second

555

layer Streptavidin-HRP (S911, Life Technologies) diluted 1:1,600 in PBS/0.1% BSA

556

(37525; Thermo Fisher Scientific) was then added and incubated for another 1 hour.

557

Plates were then washed, and signal was developed by adding POD substrate

558

(11484281001, Roche) for 5 minutes before stopping the reaction with 1 M H2SO4.

559

Absorbance (OD450) was measured using a Clariostar plate reader (BMG, Labtech).

560

Mean and 95% confidence interval of 4 replicate measurements were calculated.

561

Competition was measured as: (X-minimum binding/(maximum binding-minimum

562

binding), where X is the binding of the biotinylated MAb in the presence of

563

competing MAb. Minimum binding is the self-blocking of the biotinylated MAb or

564

background binding. Maximum binding is binding of biotinylated MAb in the

565

presence of non-competing MAb (anti-influenza N1 neuraminidase MAb).

566

ACE2 blocking assays

567

Two assays were used to determine the blocking of binding of ACE2 to RBD by

568

MAbs. RBD was anchored on the plate in the first assay whereas ACE2 was anchored

569

for the second assay.

570

In the first ACE2 blocking assay, RBD-VLP (Spycatcher-mi3 VLP-particles

571

conjugated with Spytagged-RBD recombinant protein) (16) was coated on ELISA

572

plates as described for the competitive binding assay. Recombinant ACE2-Fc (18-615)

573

protein expressed in Expi293F (Life Technologies) cells was chemically biotinylated

574

using EZ-link Sulfo-NHS-Biotin (A39256; Life Technologies) and buffer exchanged

575

to PBS using a Zebaspin desalting column (Thermo Fischer). MAbs were titrated in

576

duplicate or triplicate as half-log serial dilution, 8-point series starting at 1 μM in 30

577

μl volume with PBS/0.1% BSA buffer. 30 μl of biotinylated ACE2-Fc at approx. 0.2

578

nM (40 ng/ml) was added to the antibodies. 50 μl of the mixture was transferred to the

579

PBS-washed RBD-VLP coated plates and incubated for 1 hour at room temperature.

580

Secondary Streptavidin-HRP antibody (S911, Life Technologies) diluted to 1:1600

581

was then added to the PBS-washed plates and incubated for 1 h at room temperature.

582

Plates were then washed four times with PBS and signal was developed by adding

583

POD substrate (11484281001, Roche) for 5 minutes before stopping with 1 M H2SO4.

584

OD450 was measured using a Clariostar plate reader (BMG, Labtech). The control

585

antibody (a non-blocking anti-influenza N1 MAb) or ACE2-Fc without antibody used

586

to obtain the maximum signal and wells with PBS/BSA buffer only were used to

587

determine the minimum signal. Graphs were plotted as % binding of biotinylated

588

ACE2 to RBD. Binding % = {(X - Min)/(Max - Min)}*100 where X = measurement

589

of the antibody, Min = buffer only, Max = biotinylated ACE2-Fc alone. 50%

590

inhibitory concentrations of the antibodies against ACE2 was determined using non-

591

linear regression curve fit using GraphPad Prism 8.

592

The second ACE2 blocking assay was performed as described previously (14, 15).

593

Briefly, MDCK-SIAT1 cells were stably transfected to overexpress codon-optimised

594

human ACE2 cDNA (NM_021804.1) using lentiviral vector and FACS sorted

595

(MDCK-ACE2). Cells (3 x 104 per well) were seeded on a flat-bottomed 96-well plate

596

the day before the assay. RBD-6H (340-538; NITN.GPKK) was chemically

597

biotinylated using EZ-link Sulfo-NHS-Biotin (A39256; Life Technologies). Serial

598

half-log dilutions (starting at 1 μM) of antibodies and controls were performed in a U-

599

bottomed 96 well plate in 30 μl volume. 30 μl of biotinylated RBD (25 nM) were

600

mixed and 50 μl of the mixture was then transferred to the MDCK-ACE2 cells. After

601

1 hour a second layer Streptavidin-HRP antibody (S911, Life Technologies) diluted

602

1:1,600 in PBS/0.1% BSA (37525; Thermo Fisher Scientific) was added and

603

incubated for another 1 hour. Plates were then washed four times with PBS and signal

604

was developed by adding POD substrate (11484281001, Roche) before stopping with

605

1 M H2SO4 after 5 minutes. OD450 was measured using a Clariostar plate reader

606

(BMG, Labtech). The control antibody (a non-blocking anti-influenza N1 antibody)

607

was used to obtain maximum signal and PBS only wells were used to determine

608

background. Graphs were plotted as % binding of biotinylated RBD to ACE2. The

609

50% inhibitory concentration of the blocking antibody was determined as described

610

above.

A sample (10 µg/ml) is considered positive when the measured extinction is at least 3 times the OD450
value of the negative control in the ELISA. CR3022 is an anti-SARS RBD human MAb and BS-1A is
an anti-influenza H3 human MAb. OD values of ≥ 1.00 or 0.50-0.99 or ≤ 0.49 are highlighted in deep
orange, orange and light orange, respectively.
