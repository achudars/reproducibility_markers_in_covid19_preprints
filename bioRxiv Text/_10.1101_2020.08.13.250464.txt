ABSTRACT

50

Bats host many viruses pathogenic to humans, and increasing evidence suggests that

51

Rotavirus A (RVA) also belongs to this list. Rotaviruses cause diarrheal disease in many

52

mammals and birds, and their segmented genomes allow them to reassort and increase

53

their genetic diversity. Eighteen out of 2,142 bat fecal samples (0.8%) collected from

54

Europe, Central America and Africa were PCR-positive for RVA and 11 of those were

55

fully characterized using viral metagenomics. Upon contrasting their genomes with

56

publicly available data, at least 7 distinct bat RVA genotype constellations (GCs) were

57

identified, including evidence of reassortments and 6 novel genotypes. Some of these

58

constellations are spread across the world, whereas others appear to be geographically

59

restricted. Our analyses also suggest that several unusual human and equine RVA

60

strains might be of bat RVA origin, based on their phylogenetic clustering, despite

61

varying levels of nucleotide sequence identities between them. Although SA11 is one of

62

the most widely used reference strains for RVA research and forms the backbone of a

63

reverse genetics system, its origin remained enigmatic. Remarkably, the majority of the

64

genotypes of SA11-like strains were shared with Gabonese bat RVAs, suggesting a

65

potential common origin. Overall, our findings suggest an underexplored genetic

66

diversity of RVAs in bats, which is likely only the tip of the iceberg. Increasing contact

67

between humans and bat wildlife will further increase the zoonosis risk, which warrants

68

closer attention to these viruses.

global preparedness against emerging viral pathogens. The current effort to characterize

75

bat rotavirus strains from 3 continents shed light on the vast genetic diversity of

76

rotaviruses and also hinted at a bat origin for several atypical rotaviruses in humans and

animals, implying that zoonoses of bat rotaviruses might occur more frequently than

currently realized.

INTRODUCTION

93

Rotaviruses are the leading cause of diarrheal disease in the young of mammals and

94

birds. In humans, rotaviruses are responsible for 122,000-216,000 deaths in under 5-

95

year old infants on a yearly basis, mainly in developing countries (1). The Rotavirus

96

genus belongs to the family Reoviridae and contains 9 species designated as A-I (RVA-

97

RVI). The rotavirus genome consists of 11 dsRNA segments encoding 6 structural viral

98

proteins (VP1-6) and 6 non-structural proteins (NSP1-6) (2).

99

The RVA outer capsid antigens, VP4 and VP7 are used for a dual classification system

100

defining P-genotype (VP4 is Protease sensitive) and G-genotype (VP7 is Glycosylated),

101

respectively (2). However, as gene reassortment is a common phenomenon for viruses

102

with a segmented genome after co-infection, a more comprehensive classification

103

approach became necessary to better account for the genome evolution and genetic

104

diversity of RVAs. In 2008, a nucleotide sequence-based, complete genome

105

classification system was developed for RVA, define genotypes for each of the 11 gene

106

segment. These genotypes allowed extending the dual classification to full ‘genotype

107

constellations’ classification (3, 4). The gene assignments are reported as Gx-P[x]-Ix-Rx-

108

Cx-Mx-Ax-Nx-Tx-Ex-Hx, where ‘x’ denotes the particular genotype. The Rotavirus

109

Classification Working Group (RCWG) was formed in order to assign new genotypes to

110

rotavirus genes which could not be assigned to an established genotype (5).

111

Accumulating whole genome sequencing data demonstrate that there are typical GCs

112

present in most animal species. Two of them, Wa-like and DS-1-like, are responsible for

113

most of the human disease and designated as I1-R1-C1-M1-A1-N1-T1-E1-H1 and I2-

114

R2-C2-M2-A2-N2-T2-E2-H2, respectively, for the non-G/P genotypes (3). Furthermore,

115

various animal species are known to have specific GCs such as I2-R2-C2-M25

116

A3/A11/A13-N2-T6-E2-H3 for cattle and other even-toed ungulates (6), I1/I5-R1-M1-

117

A1/A8-N1-T1/T7-E1-H1 for swine (3, 7), I2/I6-R2-C2-M3-A10-N2-T3-E2/E12-H7 for

118

horses (8), and I3-R3-C3-M3-A3/A9-N2-T3-E3-H3/H6 for cats and dogs (9). Partially

119

shared genotype patterns between established GCs, such as Wa-like human RVA

120

strains and porcine RVAs, as well as DS-1-like human RVA strains and bovine RVAs,

121

suggest a common origin and important zoonotic transfer events in the past (3).

122

Bats belong to the Chiroptera order, which is the second largest order of mammals (10).

123

They harbor a high diversity of viruses, among them are also zoonotic viruses such as

124

lyssavirus, Hendra and Nipah viruses, filovirus and several coronaviruses (11–17).

125

Given their great population densities, migration ability and proximity to human habitats,

126

bats are often screened for emerging and re-emerging viral pathogens (18, 19). Such

127

screenings have resulted in the sporadic identification of rotavirus strains in bats in the

128

last decade. Even though there are reports of RVH in South Korean bats (20) and

129

Cameroonian bats (21), and a novel rotavirus species (tentatively named RVJ) was

130

identified from Schreiber's bats in Serbia (22); RVA is the most commonly detected

131

species and there are currently more than 20 bat RVA strains identified. In 2010, Esona

132

and colleagues reported the first partially sequenced RVA strain (RVA/Bat-

133

wt/KEN/KE4852/07/2007/G25P[6]) in a Kenyan Eidolon helvum (straw-colored fruit bat),

134

and the majority of retrieved gene segments were only distantly related to known

135

mammalian RVA strains (23). During the subsequent decade, sporadic and scattered

136

reports have been published about RVA strains in bats collected from serum, gut and

137

fecal samples in insectivorous and fruit bats. Several of these reports came from

138

Chinese studies (24–27), but bat RVAs were also detected and (partially) characterized

139

from France (28), Brazil (29), Zambia (30, 31), Cameroon (32), Kenya (33) and Saudi6

140

Arabia (34). These studies investigate samples from a variety of bat families such as

141

Rhinolophidae (24, 30), Hipposideridae (25, 26), Vespertilionidae (26, 28), Molossidae,

142

Phyllostomidae

143

Rhinopomatidae (34). From some of these novel bat RVA strains a few gene segments

144

were sequenced, whereas other strains were sequenced completely, often resulting in

145

one or multiple novel genotypes (23, 26, 29, 31, 32).

146

Even though RVAs are generally considered to have a rather restricted host range, a

147

number of unusual strains have been described in literature, suggestive of interspecies

148

transmissions

149

wt/ARG/E3198/2008/G3P[3] strain that was isolated from a diarrheic foal in Argentina in

150

2008 (35). Although its GC was distantly related to feline/canine-like RVA strains at that

151

time, 2 more recent publications showed a closer relationship with Chinese bat RVA

152

strains in several gene segments (24, 25). A second example was the unusual human

153

G3P[3] RVA strain RVA/Human-wt/JPN/12638/2014/G3P[3], isolated from a 4 year-old

154

child with severe gastroenteric symptoms in Japan. Three out of its 11 gene segments

155

were closely related to a South African bat RVA strain, suggesting a reassortment

156

involving a bat RVA strain (36). A third example are two unique G20 human RVA strains,

157

RVA/Human-wt/ECU/Ecu534/2006/G20P[28]

158

wt/SUR/2014735512/2013/G20P[28] (38). The recent identification of the G20 genotype

159

in a Brazilian bat RVA strain (RVA/Bat-wt/BRA/3081/2013/G20P[x]) also suggests a

160

potential bat reservoir for these human strains (29).

161

All in all, slowly emerging data on bat RVA strains start to show that some unusual

162

human and animal RVA strains might actually have been derived from bats. Therefore,

the global surveillance of novel and reassortant RVA bat strains has to continue in order

to better understand the genetic diversity of bat RVA strains, as well as to maintain both

165

public and animal health. Here we report identification of 11 bat RVA strains from

166

Bulgaria, Gabon, Ghana and Costa Rica, suggesting evidence of multiple reassortment

167

and host switching events from bats to bats and to other mammals.

169

RESULTS & DISCUSSION

170

Bats are known hosts of various human pathogens, including viruses such as rabies

171

virus, henipaviruses, Marburg virus, SARS and MERS CoVs (11–17). In addition, there

172

have been sporadic reports on several other RNA viruses in bats such as

173

paramyxoviruses, picornaviruses, orthoreoviruses and astroviruses (39–42). Bat

174

rotaviruses have also been sporadically reported during the last decade and it was

175

rotavirus A (RVA) that has been the most frequently reported rotavirus species. This is

176

not very surprising given the fact that RVA has been detected in a wide range of

177

mammals and birds (43–45). Furthermore, there are plenty of examples of this enteric

178

pathogen being capable of interspecies transmission in literature, sometimes in

179

combination with reassortments, between various mammalian species including humans

180

(46). In some occasions, such animal-derived gene segments (e.g. VP7 genotypes G8

181

from cattle, G9 and presumably G12 from pigs) or complete GCs (AU-1 like strains from

182

cats) have become established in the human population. This established circulation

183

either happened in a limited geographical region (AU-1 like or G8) or worldwide; such as

184

epidemiologically important human pathogenic G9 and G12 RVAs (47, 48).

185

In order to further investigate the potential of bat RVA strains to spill over between bats

186

or towards other mammalian species, we investigated RVA strains from over 2,000 bats,

187

spanning 5 countries in 3 continents. The bat fecal samples that were collected from

188

Bulgaria, Romania, Germany, Gabon, Ghana and Costa Rica were screened for RVA,

189

using a nested RT-PCR targeting a short piece of the highly conserved polymerase

190

gene (VP1, Table S1). This screening yielded 18 positives out of the 2,142 screened

191

samples (0.8%) (Table S2). The RVA detection rate per species ranged from 0 to 1.1%,

192

except for H. gigas (14.9%). The reason for this higher detection rate is unknown, but

193

could be due to: 1) better matching oligonucleotides used for the detection, 2) an

194

ongoing RVA outbreak in the sampled caves, or 3) higher circulation of enteropathogens

195

in H. gigas. RVA positive samples were collected from five bat families Pteropodidae,

From 16 of the RVA positive samples, a sufficient amount of sample was available for

201

complete viral genome sequencing using the NetoVIR protocol (Table S3). 118.9 million

202

paired-end (PE) reads (2x150 base pairs) and an average of 7 million PE reads/sample

203

were generated by Illumina sequencing (Table 1). Four samples from Gabon and 1

204

sample from Germany did not yield any RVA contigs longer than 500 base pairs and

205

were therefore not investigated further. From 11 samples near complete RVA genomes

206

could be retrieved. These RVA samples belonged to 5 out of the 46 tested bat species

207

(10.8%), from 4 out of the 10 (40%) tested families, as shown in the bat phylogenetic

208

tree (Table S2, Figure S1). The percentage of reads mapping to RVA in each sample

209

ranged from 0-90% (Table 1).

210

The GCs of the 11 bat RVA strains are shown in Table 2. The genotype assignments,

212

some of the Gabonese strains and NSP1 (A32) and NSP3 (T23) genotypes for the strain

213

from Costa Rica were made according to the guidelines determined by the RCWG (49).

214

Although the NSP5 gene segment of RVA/Bat-wt/CRC/KCR10-93/2010/G20P[47] most

215

likely also represents a novel genotype, we were not able to retrieve the complete ORF

216

(despite several attempts using RT-PCR and Sanger sequencing), which is required for

217

the assignment of a novel genotype (50). Particular GCs were identified in different

218

geographic locations (Table 2). Gabonese strains were similar to each other, with certain

219

genotypes shared with the Bulgarian strains (G3, P[3], C3, M3, N3, T3 and E3).

220

However, they do not cluster phylogenetically closely together (vide supra), indicating

221

non-recent reassortment events. KCR10-93 also possessed a unique GC, except for the

222

VP4 genotype P[47], which was shared with the Ghanaian strain. Interestingly, these 2

223

VP4 genes were very closely related (vide supra), suggesting a recent reassortment

224

event. Gabonese GKS-912, GKS-926 and GKS-934 appeared to have a co-infection, as

225

multiple genotypes were identified in these samples for VP2, VP3, VP4, NSP2, NSP3

226

and NSP4. For GKS-934, 2 near complete VP7 gene segments were identified, both

227

belonging to the G3 genotype, yet having a substantial nucleotide level dissimilarity

228

(19%, vide infra). This was also the case for K212 possessing 2 distinct M14 genotypes

229

with 12% nucleotide sequence distance.

231

At least 7 seven distinct bat RVA genotype constellations

232

Even though most animal species, including humans, have a limited number of typical

RVA GCs, the RVAs harbored by bats show a great genetic diversity. Combining our

234

data with previously published bat RVA genomes showed that there are at least 7

235

distinct bat RVA GCs circulating in the bat population (Table 3), ranging from completely

237

15/2008/G3P[3] and RVA/Bat-wt/BGR/BR89-60/2008/G3P[3] strains were identical or

238

very similar to MSLH14-like RVA strains from China and a partially sequenced strain

239

from Brazil (“orange” GC in Table 3). Even though at least 3 of the samples from Gabon

240

possessed more than one RVA strain, they possessed at least 3 distinct but related GCs

241

(“purple”

242

wt/GHA/K212/2009/G30P[47] (“green” GC in Table 3) was identical or very similar to

243

several previously identified Cameroonian bat RVA strains (32), as well as some

244

partially sequenced bat RVA strains from Zambia (31). RVA/Bat-wt/CRC/KCR10-

245

93/2010/G20P[47] had a distinct GC (“brown” GC in Table 3), including at least 2

246

previously undescribed genotypes, and shared the G20 genotype with RVA/Bat-

247

wt/BRA/3081/2013/G20P[x]. Of interest was the P[47] genotype, which was shared with

2 African strains from the green GC. The “yellow” GC in Table 3 was composed of 2

such as P[10] for VP4, R20 for VP1 and A29 for NSP1 (Table S4a and S4b), which are

261

most likely the results of reassortment events with currently unknown RVA strains (25,

262

26). Reassortment also takes place between different bat RVA GCs, albeit to a limited

263

extension. For example, RVA/Bat-wt/GAB/GKS-897/2009/G3P[3] is the only strain from

264

the purple GC with the I8 VP6 genotype, which is shared with several strains from the

265

orange

266

wt/CHN/BSTM70/2015/G3P[3], RVA/Bat-tc/CHN/MYAS33/2013/G3P[10] and RVA/Bat-

267

wt/CHN/YSSK5/2015/G3P[3]), suggesting a reassortment event. A second example is

268

the shared P[47] VP4 genotype between RVA/Bat-wt/GHA/K212/2009/G30P[47] and

269

RVA/Bat-wt/CMR/BatLy17/2014/G30P[47] (green GC) and RVA/Bat-wt/CRC/KCR10-

270

93/2010/G20P[47] (brown GC) (Table 2). Interestingly, these last 3 strains were 97-

271

100% identical to each other on the nucleotide level for VP4, suggesting a recent

272

reassortment event. Finally, there are also a few bat RVA strains with unusual genotype

273

composition, which do not clearly fall into the 7 described GCs. RVA strains RVA/Bat-

274

wt/ZMB/LUS12-14/2012/G3P[3] and RVA/Bat-wt/CHN/YSSK5/2015/G3P[3] possess

undergo multiple host switching events. The Bulgarian RVA strains were isolated from

283

rhinolophid bats, whereas the Chinese MSLH14-like strains were found in bats from the

284

Rhinolophidae, Hipposideridae and Emballonuridae families (Table S4a).

285

In addition to RVAs potentially being able to infect multiple bat families, individual bat

286

families could also harbor more than one GC, as is shown in Table S4c. Pteropodid bats

287

harbor completely unique GCs (green and yellow), suggesting that the associated RVA

288

strains have a high epidemiologic fitness in these populations. This further indicates that

289

the Pteropodidae, which includes the straw-colored fruit bats, has been a substantial

290

virus reservoir for a long time already, as also shown for Marburg virus, Hendra and

291

Nipah viruses (12–14).

292
293

Wide geographic dispersal of bat RVA GCs

294

The global distribution of the bat RVA GCs revealed several patterns regarding RVA

295

circulation in bats, as shown in Figure 1. Bat RVAs belonging to the brown, purple, blue

296

and dark grey GCs have so far only been identified in Costa Rica (and perhaps Brazil),

297

Gabon, Kenya and China, respectively. On the other hand, the green and yellow GCs

298

were confirmed to be further dispersed, from Cameroon to Saudi Arabia (G25P[43]), and

299

from Ghana and Cameroon to Zambia, respectively, as was previously suggested by

300

Sasaki et al. (51). However, highly similar RVA strains belonging to the orange MSLH14-

301

like GCs span at least 3 different continents and subcontinents, e.g. Asia, Europe and

302

possibly Central America. Furthermore, it was also shown that RVA strains with distinct

303

GCs could co-circulate in the same region, as is the case in Cameroon (green, yellow

304

and purple GCs) and China (orange and dark grey GCs) (Figure 1).

305

With powered flight, migratory bats can travel long distances between summer and

306

winter roosts, for foraging and searching for a mate (52). Among long-distance migratory

307

bats, E. helvum can cover a range of 270 to 2,500 km (53), vespertilionid ‘tree bats’ and

308

the subtropical/tropical molossid bats can fly over 1,000 km (54, 55). Global distribution

309

and intercontinental bat virus transfers are also typical to other bat viruses (56). In

310

addition to migration across vast distances, the fact that some distinct GCs seem to

311

have overlapping geographical ranges (such as in China and West Africa in Figure 1)

312

suggest a fitness advantage for these particular genotypes occurring together. However,

313

there is also ample evidence of gene reassortment events among established GCs (e.g.

314

P[47] in green and brown GC; or I8 in purple and orange GC), or with RVA strains of

315

currently unknown origin (e.g. A29, A15, E27).

316

It is clear that more bats should be sampled in order to have a comprehensive

317

understanding of the driving and restricting forces of bat RVA genetic diversity, or the

318

lack thereof. The detection of P[47] reassortment between Ghanaian and Costa Rican

319

bat RVAs, which are located more than 9,000 km’s apart, cannot only be explained by

320

the flight ability of bats, but rather the lack of sampling between these 2 locations. We

321

hypothesize that with the increasing bat RVA sequencing efforts, the geographical and

322

host range of most GCs (such as the blue, dark grey, yellow and brown) will be

323

significantly expanded.

324
325

Potential of interspecies transmissions of bat RVA to mammalian hosts

326

We further investigated whether there is potential for unusual RVA strains detected in

327

other mammals (including humans) to be a result of an interspecies transmission from

328

bat strains identified in the current and other studies (Table 3).

331

In 2013, Miño and colleagues reported an unusual Argentinian equine G3P[3] RVA

332

strain RVA/Horse-wt/ARG/E3198/2008/G3P[3]. Based on the GC, it was speculated to

333

have a common ancestor with both feline/canine RVA strains, as well as the unusual

334

rhesus RVA strain RRV. However, the nucleotide identities were below the 90% for most

335

of the genome segments, suggesting that the original host may not be identified yet (35).

336

When more bat RVA genomes became available in subsequent years, Xia and

337

colleagues, and later also Biao He and colleagues, suggested that E3198 might be of

338

bat origin, based on the GCs and nucleotide similarities (25, 26). The close genetic

339

relationship between E3198 and the Bulgarian strains presented here, across all 11

340

gene segments, might further suggest a bat origin of this unusual equine RVA strain

341

(Figures 2-4, Figure S2a, nucleotide similarities 87-97%).

342
343

Unexpected high similarities between bat and simian RVA strains

344

RVA strain RVA/Simian-tc/ZAF/SA11-H96/1958/G3P[2] was isolated from an overtly

345

healthy vervet monkey and has subsequently been used extensively as a laboratory

346

strain in RVA growth, virulence, genome replication and in recent years also a reverse

347

genetics research (57–59). However, its origin remained obscure, as related strains

348

were never identified in vervet monkeys or other non-human primates ever after. In

349

2011, Ghosh and colleagues identified an unusual RVA strain RVA/Human-

350

tc/KEN/B10/1987/G3P[2]

351

with SA11-H96. They speculated about a simian or other animal origin of this strain (60).

352

Around the same time, a second human RVA strain RVA/Human/CHN/ZTR-

353

5/XXXX/G3P[2], nearly identical to SA11-H96 (Figure S2b) was deposited in GenBank

354

as a potential vaccine candidate. However, the controversy about the origin of these

355

SA11-like strains (SA11-H96, B10 and ZTR-5) remained. To our surprise, the purple GC

356

described in this paper, containing only the bat RVA strains from Gabon, showed up to

357

seven genotypes in common with these SA11-like strains (Table 3), with varying

358

degrees of nucleotide similarities (Figures S2b, c). According to phylogenetic analyses

359

the bat RVAs from Gabon and Kenya clustered with B10 for the VP1, VP6, NSP4 gene

360

segments, and with all 3 strains (B10, SA11-H96 and ZTR-5) for VP2-4, NSP1, NSP3

361

and NSP5 (Figures 2-4).

362

Not only for SA11-H96, but also for RVA/Simian-tc/USA/RRV/1975/G3P[3] and

363

RVA/Rhesus-tc/USA/TUCH/2002/G3P[24], some close relationships with bat RVA

364

strains were noted. The VP1, VP3, VP4, VP6, VP7, NSP1-5 genes of RRV clustered

365

closely with one or multiple bat and bat-related RVA strains (Figures 2-4). For TUCH,

366

the VP1, NSP1, NSP5 gene segments also clustered close to bat RVA strains (Figures

367

2-4).

368

The finding that the purple SA11-like GC was found in multiple bats in Gabon, and only

369

on a single occasion in vervet monkeys and in 2 unrelated human cases, makes bats

370

the prime suspect of being the major hosts of these viruses, making the monkey and

371

humans strains putative examples of interspecies transmissions. It should however be

372

noted that the phylogenetic clustering between these bat, simian and human strains is

373

still rather variable, and the nucleotide similarities are not as high as between bat RVA

374

strains

375

suggesting that more RVAs from currently unsampled animal species will likely cluster in

376

between. However, 2 other bat strains are of further interest: 1) the bat RVA strain

377

RVA/Bat/KEN/322/Kwale/2015/G3P[10] (only available as a GenBank entry at this point)

378

seems to have a mixed GC possessing both characteristics of the orange and purple

379

GCs (Table 3). Especially, the purple genotypes R8, M5 and A5 of 322/Kwale are of

380

interest as they are much more closely related to the SA11-like strains than the Gabon

381

bat

382

wt/KEN/BATp39/2015/G36P[51] (only available in GenBank) possesses a single purple

383

genotype I16, and again this is more closely related to the SA11-like strain B10

384

compared to the Gabon RVA strains. Taken all together, we speculate that with further

385

RVA screenings in bat populations, more bat RVA strains that are closely related to the

386

vervet monkey RVA strain SA11-H96 and human SA11-like RVA strains may be

387

detected.

Evidence of bat RVA strains transmitted to humans?

390

The G3 genotype is usually associated with P[8] genotype in humans RVAs, and

391

combinations such as G3P[3] and G3P[9] are only sporadically found in the human

392

population (61). Nonetheless, in the 2000-2001 season, the VP4, VP7, VP6 and NSP4

393

genes

394

wt/THA/CMH222/2001/G3P[3], detected in a 2 year-old severely diarrheic patient in

395

Thailand (41). It was reported to have a VP7 gene closely related to RVA/Simian-

396

tc/USA/RRV/1975/G3P[3] and a VP4 gene that was caprine-like. Subsequently, Xia and

397

colleagues speculated that this strain is distinct from typical human RVA GCs and very

398

likely shared a common ancestor with Asian bat RVAs (33). Our study provides further

399

evidence for the bat origin of CMH222, as the VP6 I8 genotype of CMH222 is closely

400

related to RVA/Bat-wt/GAB/GKS-897/2009/G3P[3] (Figure 3).

403

tc/CHN/L621/2006/G3P[9] and RVA/Human-wt/CHN/E2451/2011/G3P[9] strains were

404

isolated from a symptomatic adult and a symptomatic child, respectively (62). Complete

405

genome analyses revealed a high genetic relatedness to strains of feline/canine origin

406

for almost all 11 genes. L621 and E2451 also clustered near the aforementioned

407

unusual RVA/Horse-wt/ARG/E3198/2008/G3P[3] for the VP3, VP6, NSP2, NSP5 genes;

408

and L621 additionally also clustered with the E3198 NSP3 gene. Here, we observed that

409

these atypical Asian human strains were also closely related to the Bulgarian bat RVA

410

strains for VP3, VP6, NSP2, NSP4, NSP5 and Gabonese bat strains for NSP2, NSP3,

411

NSP4 of the orange GC (Figures 2-4). These additional findings further substantiate, as

412

well as complicate the identification of the likely bat host, from which the L621 and

413

E2451 strains likely jumped to humans.

414

Following these potential zoonosis reports, Esona and colleagues also revealed

415

remarkable findings in Latin America in 2018, where only limited bat RVA information is

416

present to date (38). A human strain RVA/Human-wt/SUR/2014735512/2013/G20P[28]

417

was isolated in Suriname, and possessed a rare G20 genotype, which was also

418

420

wt/BRA/3081/2013/G20P[x] for the VP7, NSP3 and NSP5 genes (Figure S2d) and it was

speculated to be of bat origin as these genotypes have not been detected in any other

422

animal species so far. RVA/Bat-wt/CRC/KCR10-93/2010/G20P[47] also showed

423

nucleotide similarities ranging from 82% to 92% with 2014735512 for 9 out of 11 gene

424

segments, and also phylogenetically clustered together, albeit not very closely (Figures

Conclusion

429

Despite the limited number of bat species that have been screened for rotaviruses, a

430

surprisingly large genetic diversity of RVA strains is presented in this study, including 6

431

novel genotypes. With increasing screening efforts, it is without a doubt that this diversity

432

will expand both genetically and geographically. We also presented multiple examples of

433

close genetic relatedness of several mammalian and bat rotaviruses. The indicated

434

zoonoses has - to the best of our knowledge - always been restricted to sporadic cases

435

so far and has never resulted in major outbreaks in humans. However, it is believed that

436

the rotavirus genotype constellations currently circulating in humans also have a

437

common ancestor with animal rotaviruses, highlighting that interspecies transmissions

438

followed establishment in the human population could happen again (3).

439

Another notable finding is that several gene segments of bat RVA strains and the simian

440

SA11 RVA strain (the latter being used in global rotavirus research for decades), have a

441

common origin. Furthermore, SA11 strain has been recently used as the backbone of a

442

RVA reverse genetics system, and is therefore likely to be used even more in the future.

443

It would be intriguing to test whether or not SA11 grows well in bat cell lines, or in in vivo

444

infection experiments.

MATERIALS AND METHODS

447

Sample collection

448

Fecal samples were collected from 2,142 bats from 10 bat families, representing 46 bat

449

species (Table S2). Sample collection took place in Ghana, Gabon, Bulgaria, Romania,

450

Germany and Costa Rica during 2008-2010 as part of investigations of other viruses in

451

bats, such as coronavirus, astrovirus, and picornavirus, as described previously (56, 63–

452

66). Bat species were determined by trained field biologists. For European and Costa

453

Rican studies, bats were caught with mist nets, put into cotton bags and fecal pellets are

454

collected. Ghanaian fecal droppings were collected with plastic foil from the trees in

455

which E. helvum bats were roosting. The pellets were kept in RNAlater RNA stabilization

456

solution (QIAGEN, Hilden, Germany). Gabonese bats were also captured with mist nets

457

just before twilight and were individually euthanized. Bat feces were collected with the

458

corresponding permissions of the host countries in all of the studies.

459
460

RT-PCR rotavirus screening and viral metagenomics

461

Viral RNA was isolated from the fecal specimens as described previously (65). To

462

screen the RVA presence in bats, conserved RVA-specific primer pairs targeting the

463

VP1 gene were used (277 nucleotide long PCR product) in a hemi-nested and single

464

round reverse transcription (RT-PCR) assay (Table S1). Among the 18 positive

465

specimens (Tables S2-S3), 16 fecal samples, of which sufficient material was left, were

466

shipped to the Laboratory of Clinical and Epidemiological Virology, Leuven, Belgium on

467

dry ice, for further complete genome analyses (Table 1).

468

The NetoVIR protocol was used for viral enrichment of the fecal suspensions as

469

described before (67). Briefly, the fecal samples were suspended in dPBS and

470

homogenized with a MINILYS homogenizer (Bertin Technologies) for 20s at 3,000 rpm.

471

The homogenates were centrifuged for 3 min at 17,000 g and filtered with 0,8 μm PES

472

filters (Sartorius). Filtrates were treated with benzonase (Novagen) and micrococcal

473

nuclease (New England Biolabs) at 37 °C for 2 h to remove the free-floating nucleic

474

acids. Subsequently, samples were extracted using the QIAamp Viral RNA Mini Kit

described previously (Sigma-Aldrich) (68). Sequencing library was constructed with the

479

Data analysis

484

Low quality reads, ambiguous bases, primer and adapter sequences were removed from

485

the paired-end reads with Trimmomatic v0.36 with default parameters (69). Trimmed

486

reads were de novo assembled with metaSPAdes from SPAdes software v3.11.1 using

487

21, 33, 55, 77 k-mer lengths (70). The obtained contigs were annotated with DIAMOND

488

v0.9.10 against a non-redundant protein database (71). The contigs annotated as

489

“Rotavirus” were further investigated using the nucleotide BLAST against a nucleotide

490

reference database to identify the gene segments (72). The incomplete contigs were

491

completed in silico by mapping the trimmed reads of corresponding samples against the

492

reference sequence determined by the highest BLASTn nucleotide similarity with the

and maximum likelihood trees were reconstructed with RaxML-NG (80). GTR+G+I

509

nucleotide substitution model is used for trees of all segments, except for NSP4 and

510

NSP5, as they did not converge after 1000 bootstraps under the GTR+G+I model

511

(TIM3+I+G and HKY+I+G, respectively). FigTree v1.4.3 from the BEAST package was

512

used for phylogenetic tree visualization and manipulation (81). The GCs were illustrated

513

on a world map using the maps package in R software (82).

samples, 2 different variants of the same gene segments were identified, suggesting co-

874

infections. K212 possessed 2 distinct VP3 gene segments belonging to the same M14

genotype (indicated with an asterisk). NSP5 gene of KCR10-93 could not be assigned to

876

any of the established genotypes; neither assigned to a novel genotype as the complete

Table 3. Color-coded GCs for the bat RVA strains identified in this study, previously

879

published bat RVA strains, as well as a selection of RVA strains from other host species

880

potentially related to bats. The non-sequenced segments or unassigned genotypes are

881

denoted with ‘[letter code]?’. The genotypes colored in light grey are less relevant due to

882

a lack of (in)direct genomic relationship with bat RVAs identified in the current study.

883

The strain names are color-matched with the corresponding GCs (orange, purple, blue,
