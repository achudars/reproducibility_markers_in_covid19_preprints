Abstract
Human infections with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2)
cause coronavirus disease 19 (COVID-19) and there is currently no cure. The 3C-like protease
(3CLpro), a highly conserved protease indispensable for replication of coronaviruses, is a
promising target for development of broad-spectrum antiviral drugs. To advance the speed of
drug discovery and development, we investigated the inhibition of SARS-CoV-2 3CLpro by
natural products derived from Chinese traditional medicines. Baicalin and baicalein were
identified as the first non-covalent, non-peptidomimetic inhibitors of SARS-CoV-2 3CLpro
and exhibited potent antiviral activities in a cell-based system. Remarkably, the binding mode
of baicalein with SARS-CoV-2 3CLpro determined by X-ray protein crystallography is
distinctly different from those of known inhibitors. Baicalein is perfectly ensconced in the core
of the substrate-binding pocket by interacting with two catalytic residues, the crucial S1/S2
subsites and the oxyanion loop, acting as a “shield” in front of the catalytic dyad to prevent the
peptide substrate approaching the active site. The simple chemical structure, unique mode of
action, and potent antiviral activities in vitro, coupled with the favorable safety data from
clinical trials, emphasize that baicalein provides a great opportunity for the development of
critically needed anti-coronaviral drugs.

Coronaviruses (CoVs; subfamily Coronavirinae, family Coronaviridae, order Nidovirales),
are a group of highly diverse, enveloped, positive-sense, single-stranded RNA viruses which
are prevalent pathogens responsible for a wide range of diseases in animals as well as humans
(1, 2). Human CoV strains including 229E, NL63, OC43, and HKU1 typically lead to mild to
moderate upper respiratory tract infections such as colds and pneumonia, whereas human
infections with zoonotic CoVs, such as severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) in 2003 and
Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS) in 2012, caused severe respiratory diseases with
high morbidity and mortality. SARS-CoV-2 is a new human coronavirus identified recently
and appears to be more readily transmitted from human to human (3, 4). It is 96% identical at
the whole genome level to a bat coronavirus and shares 79.5% sequence identify to SARSCoV (5). Human infections with SARS-CoV-2 cause severe and fatal pneumonia. As of April
7, 2020, more than one million cases have been diagnosed and approximately 80000 patients
have died of coronavirus disease 19 (COVID-19) worldwide, posing a significant threat to
public health globally. It also marks the third introduction of a highly pathogenic CoV into the
human population in the 21st century. Unfortunately, no efficacious antiviral drug and vaccine
have been approved for the prophylaxis or treatment of the highly virulent SARS-CoV, MERSCoV, or SARS-CoV-2 infections in humans.
Featuring the largest genomes among the RNA viruses, CoVs share key genomic elements
that provide promising therapeutic targets (1, 6). A chymotrypsin-like cysteine protease called
3C-like protease (3CLpro, 11 cleavage sites in the polyproteins) together with a papain-like
protease (PLpro, three cleavage sites in the polyproteins) is required to process polyproteins
into mature non-structural proteins such as RNA-dependent RNA polymerase and helicase,
which are essential for viral transcription and replication. Moreover, the substrate specificity
of the 3CLpro, also known as the main protease (Mpro), is highly conserved among different
CoVs and is similar to that of the main picornavirus 3C protease, thereby making it an ideal
target for the development of broad-spectrum antiviral drugs (6, 7). Although several types of
substrate-like peptidomimetic inhibitors of SARS-CoV 3CLpro or MERS-CoV 3CLpro,
mostly with a mode of covalent action, have been reported, none has yet progressed into clinical
trials (1, 6). Classical small molecules with more-drug-like properties and their binding with
3CLpros supported by complex structure determination have not yet emerged.

Traditional Chinese medicines (TCMs) have evolved over thousands of years and are an
invaluable source for drug discovery and development. As a notable example, the discovery of
artemisinin (Qinghaosu), which was originally isolated from the TCM Artemisia annua L.
(Qinghao), is a milestone in the treatment of malaria. TCMs as well as purified natural products
also provide a rich resource for novel antiviral drug development. Several herbal medicines
and natural products have shown antiviral activities against viral pathogens (8–11). Among
these, the roots of Scutellaria baicalensis Georgi (Huangqin in Chinese) are frequently used in
TCM for the prophylaxis and treatment of hepatitis and respiratory disorders (12–14). In the
present study, an enzymatic assay was performed to test if the ingredients isolated from S.
baicalensis are inhibitors of SARS-CoV-2 3CLpro. As a result, baicalin and baicalein, two
bioactive components from S. baicalensis, are identified as novel inhibitors of SARS-CoV-2
3CLpro with an antiviral activity in the SARS-CoV-2 infected cells. A crystal structure of
SARS-CoV-2 3CLpro in complex with baicalein, the first non-covalent, non-peptidomimetic
small-molecule inhibitor, was also determined, revealing a unique binding mode of this natural
product with the protease.

Inhibition of SARS-CoV-2 3CLpro by baicalin and baicalein
The pivotal role of the 3CL protease in processing polyproteins into individual functional
proteins for viral replication and a highly conserved substrate specificity of the enzyme among
various CoVs make it a promising target for screening of inhibitors. A ﬂuorescence resonance
energy transfer (FRET) protease assay was applied to measure the proteolytic activity of the
recombinant SARS-CoV-2 3CLpro on a fluorogenic substrate. The detail of the assay is
described in the Experimental section. This FRET-based protease assay was utilized to screen
natural products as novel inhibitors of SARS-CoV-2 3CLpro. It was first used to determine the
inhibitory activities of the total aqueous extract, fractionations, and purified compounds from
S. baicalensis against SARS-CoV-2 3CLpro (see Supplementary Materials, Fig. S1). As the
result, two fractions from S. baicalensis showed significant inhibition on SARS-CoV-2 3CLpro
at 10.0 g/mL (Table S1). Surprisingly, baicalin, the major component in fraction 8, shows an
IC50 of 6.41 M against the protease, while baicalein, the major component in fraction 12, has

an IC50 of 0.94 M (Fig. S2; Table 1). Accordingly, baicalin and baicalein are identified as
novel non-peptidomimetic inhibitors of SARS-CoV-2 3CLpro with single-digit micromolar
potency.

Protein-ligand binding supported by ITC and ESI-MS
To validate the binding of baicalin and baicalein with SARS-CoV-2 3CLpro and exclude
the suspicion of being the pan-assay interference compounds (PAINS) (15), their binding
affinities with the protease were measured by isothermal titration calorimetry (ITC), widely
known as an invaluable tool used to determine thermodynamic parameters of protein-ligand
interactions such as Kd (Fig. 1, A and B; Table 1). The resulting Kd of baicalin and baicalein
binding with SARS-CoV-2 3CLpro is 11.50 and 4.03 M, respectively, which has a good
correlation with the IC50s mentioned above, demonstrating that specific binding of the
compounds with the enzyme is responsible for their bioactivities. Moreover, the ITC profiles
in combination with their chemical structures suggest that baicalin and baicalein act as noncovalent inhibitors of SARS-CoV-2 3CLpro with a high ligand binding efficiency.
Native state electrospray ionization mass spectrometry (ESI-MS) has been used extensively
to directly observe native state proteins and protein complexes, allowing direct detection of
protein-ligand non-covalent complexes with Kds as weak as 1 mM (16). The determination of
m/z between [protein + ligand] m/z and [unbound protein] m/z is able to identify a ligand
as a binder with the correct molecular weight, while the ratio of the intensity of the [protein
+ ligand] peaks relative to [unbound protein] peaks provides a qualitative indication of the
ligand-binding aﬃnity. Herein, an ESI-MS analysis using high-resolution magnetic resonance
mass spectrometry (MRMS) was carried out to detect the binding of baicalin and baicalein with
SARS-CoV-2 3CLpro. For the free protease performance optimization, the mass range around
the change stated 18+ was isolated with a center mass of the quadrupole of m/z 3750 (Fig. S3).
For the ligand-binding screening studies, two charge states (18+ and 19+) have been used for
calculation of the free protease and protein-ligand complex intensities. The representative
spectra of samples containing SARS-CoV-2 3CLpro (1 M) and baicalin (3.13 M) or
baicalein (0.31 M) acquired under both optimized and screening conditions are shown in Fig.

2C and D, demonstrating a specific binding of baicalin or baicalein with the protease. Moreover,
the plot of the fraction of the bound protease versus the total concentration of baicalin or
baicalein obtained Kds of 12.73 and 1.40 µM for baicalin and baicalein, respectively (Fig. 1E
and F), in keeping with the results from the ITC measurements.

Crystal structure of SARS-CoV-2 3CLpro in complex with baicalein
The mode of action of baicalein and the structural determinants associated with its binding
with SARS-CoV-2 3CLpro were further explored using X-ray protein crystallography. The
crystal structure of SARS-CoV-2 3CLpro in complex with baicalein was determined at a
resolution of 2.2 Å (Fig. 2; Table S2). The protease has a catalytic Cys145-His41 dyad and an
extended binding site, features shared by SARS-CoV 3CLpro and MERS-CoV 3CLpro (Fig.
2A). The inhibitor binds in a core region of the substrate-binding site at the surface of the
protease, between domains I and II (Fig. 2, A and B). Examination of the active site of the
complex revealed that three phenolic hydroxyl groups of baicalein made multiple hydrogen
bonds with main chains of Leu141/Gly143 as well as side chains of Ser144/His163 with or
without the aid of a buried water molecule (Fig. 2C). The only carbonyl group established a
hydrogen bond with the main chain of Glu166, while the free phenyl ring inserted into the S2
sub-pocket

Gln189/Arg188/Met49/Cys44/His41. Notably, apart from the hydrophobic interactions, the
catalytic Cys145 and His41 also formed S— (a distance of 3.3 Å from the sulfur to the
centroid of the phenyl ring) and  — interactions with the aromatic rings of baicalein,
respectively. The side chain of Asn142 also established NH2— (a distance of 3.6 Å from the
nitrogen to the centroid of the phenyl ring) interactions with baicalein, which together with the
interactions contributed by Cys145 lead the phenyl ring with three OH groups to be sandwiched
between Cys145 and Asn142. Moreover, Met165 contacted the middle ring of baicalein via
hydrophobic interactions. Consequently, baicalein is perfectly ensconced in the core of the
substrate-binding pocket and interacts with two catalytic residues, the oxyanion loop (residues
138–145), Glu166, and the S1/S2 subsites, which are the key elements for recognition of
substrates as well as peptidomimetic inhibitors (17). Although baicalein did not move deeply

into the S1 sub-pocket, its phenolic hydroxyl groups did form contacts with the crucial residue
of this sub-pocket, His163, via the water molecule. By the aid of an array of direct and indirect
hydrogen bonds with Leu141/Gly141/Ser144, baicalein fixed the conformation of the flexible
oxyanion loop, which serves to stabilize the tetrahedral transition state of the proteolytic
reaction. These results together provide the molecular details of baicalein recognition by
SARS-CoV-2 3CLpro and an explanation for the observed potent activity of such a small
molecule against the protease.

Unique binding mode of baicalein with SARS-CoV-2 3CLpro
The amino sequence of SARS-CoV-2 3CLpro displays 96% sequence identity to SARSCoV 3CLpro. There are 12 residues differed in two proteases and none of them participates in
the direct contacts with baicalein. The high level of sequence identified between two proteases
allows one to assume that baicalein will bind to the SARS-CoV 3CLpro in the same way as it
does to SARS-CoV-2 3CLpro. The inhibition assay shows that baicalein can also inhibit SARSCoV 3CLpro, with an IC50 of 1.18 ± 0.37 µM. Thus, a three-dimensional model of SARS-CoV
3CLpro in complex with baicalein was constructed by superimposing the crystal structure of
SARS-CoV-2 3CLpro/baicalein with that of SARS-CoV 3CLpro/TG-0204998 (PDB code
2ZU4) (Fig. S4A). The binding mode of baicalein with SARS-CoV 3CLpro is distinctively
different from those of known inhibitors. All of the crystal structures of the inhibitor-bound
SARS-CoV 3CLpro were collected for a comparison analysis (Fig. S4B). If those
peptidomimetic inhibitors are delineated like “swords” to compete with the binding of substrate,
baicalein works as a “shield” in front of two catalytic dyads to prevent the approach of the
substrate to the active site (Fig. S4B). Such a unique binding mode in combination with its high
ligand-binding efficiency and small molecular weight renders baicalein valuable for drug
development.

Antiviral activities of baicalin and baicalein in cells
We further evaluated the antiviral efﬁcacy of baicalin and baicalein against a clinical isolate
of SARS-CoV-2 (5) in Vero E6 cells. The cytotoxicity of two compounds in the cells was first

determined by the CCK8 assay, and the resulting half-cytotoxic concentration (CC50) of the
two compounds was over 200 μM, demonstrating a very low cytotoxicity of baicalin and
baicalein (Fig. 3). Subsequently, the Vero E6 cells were infected with SARS-CoV-2 at a
multiplicity of infection (MOI) of 0.05 in the presence of different concentrations of baicalin
or baicalein. The antiviral efﬁcacies were evaluated by quantiﬁcation of viral copy numbers in
the cell supernatant via quantitative real-time RT-PCR (qRT-PCR). As shown in Fig. 3, both
baicalin and baicalein showed a dose-dependent inhibition on the replication of SARS-CoV-2,
and the resulting half-maximal effective concentrations (EC50) of the two compounds were
10.27 and 1.69 M, respectively. The corresponding selectivity index (SI = CC50/EC50) values
are 19 and 118 for baicalin and baicalein, respectively. Therefore, the cell-based antiviral
activity of baicalin or baicalein is superior to most of the reported compounds and that of
baicalein is close to those of chloroquine (EC50: 1.13 M; SI > 88) and remdesivir (EC50: 0.77
M; SI > 129) (18).

Discussion
Three global pandemics, SARS, MERS, and COVID-19, have raised great awareness about
the increasing risks of highly pathogenic CoV infections in humans or animals and call for the
development of efficacious anti-coronaviral drugs. 3CLpros provide a promising target for
development of broad-spectrum antiviral drugs. These cysteine proteases are excised from the
viral polyproteins by their own proteolytic activities and are indispensable for replication of
CoVs. The substrate specificity of 3CLpros is featured by the efficient cleavage in the peptides
including (Leu,Phe,Met,Val)-Gln(Ser,Ala,Gly) sequences (the cleavage site is indicated by
), and the crystal structures have revealed a remarkable degree of conservation of the
substrate-binding sites, particularly for the crucial S1/S2 subsites (7, 19, 20). Accordingly,
substrate analogs or mimetics attached with a chemical warhead targeting the catalytic cysteine
were designed as peptidomimetic inhibitors of 3CLpros with a covalent mechanism of action
(6). A series of diamide acetamides acting as non-covalent SARS-CoV 3CLpro inhibitors and
their binding modes examined by crystal structures have been reported, but they are more or
less peptidomimetic inhibitors and a continuous development of these compounds is absent

(21). Although several other small molecules have been declared as 3CLpro inhibitors, a solid
validation of their binding with 3CLpros by ITC or complex structure determination is lacking.
As none of the known inhibitors has been moved to clinical trials, considerable efforts to
discover novel small molecule inhibitors of 3CLpros are urgently needed.
In view of the long history of TCMs in treating viral infections and the urgent need of drug
development against COVID-19, we investigated the anti-SARS-CoV-2 potential of natural
products isolated from S. baicalensis, a long-term used TCM. S. baicalensis is also the major
component of Chinese traditional patent medicines such as “Shuanghuanglian” and "Qingfei
Paidutang" which have proven effective in curing patients of COVID-19 in China (22). As a
result, we identified two small natural products, baicalin and baicalein, as the first class of noncovalent, non-peptidomimetic inhibitors of SARS-CoV-2 3CLpro by the enzymatic assay in
combination with the ITC, ESI-MS, and X-ray protein crystallography studies. In contrast to
most available covalent, peptidomimetic inhibitors of the 3CL proteases, the ITC measurement
also revealed that these two compounds are non-covalent inhibitors with a high ligand-binding
efficiency. The binding mode of baicalein with the protease revealed by the crystal structure
demonstrates that a unique protein-ligand interaction pattern is utilized by baicalein to block
the proteolytic activity of SARS-CoV-2 3CLpro. The crystal structure of baicalein-bound
SARS-CoV-2 3CLpro thus reported the ﬁrst demonstration, to the best of our knowledge, of
the 3CLpro reversibly inhibited by a small molecule derived from TCM. With a molecular
weight of 270.24 Da and a Kd of 4.03 M, baicalein serves as the most efficient binder of
3CLpros known to date. Moreover, it possesses an antiviral activity in the cells with a low
cytotoxicity. Given the high conservation of 3CLpro among various CoVs, baicalein is
expected to inhibit other 3CL proteases of CoVs, providing a new candidate for development
of broad-spectrum antiviral drugs.
In addition, baicalin tablets have been used as an adjuvant therapy for the treatment of
acute, chronic, or persistent hepatitis in China. Single oral doses of 100–2800 mg of baicalein
were safe and well tolerated by healthy subjects (clinical trials registration number
CTR20132944) (23). Furthermore, a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled,
multicenter, and phase IIa clinical trial for the effectiveness and safety of baicalein tablets in

the treatment of improving other aspects of healthy adults with influenza fever is under way
(clinical trials registration numbers CTR20182427 and NCT03830684). These favorable safety
data together with the potent inhibitory activities in enzyme and cell-based assays show a
strong preference for in vivo and clinical trials studies of baicalin and baicalein for COVID-19
treatment. Overall, the present study provides a good example for exploring the in vitro potency
of TCMs and effectively identifying bioactive ingredients toward a specific target, especially
when Chinese traditional patent medicines have been proven effective in curing patients of
COVID-19 in China.

Materials and Methods
General chemistry
S. baicalensis Georgi decoction pieces (No. 191226) were purchased from Beijing
Tongrentang China Pharmacy in Shanghai and its aqueous extract was prepared in accordance
with clinical application. The fractionation of S. baicalensis aqueous extract was performed on
a Waters AutoPurification HPLC with a 2489 PDA detector coupled with a Waters Acquity
ELSD using a Waters Sunfire RP C18 column (30 × 150 mm, 5 μm) with a 30.0 mL/min flow
rate. Baicalin and baicalein were isolated from active fractions from S. baicalensis with a purity
over 95%. Analytical HPLC and ESIMS spectra were performed on a Waters 2695 instrument
with a 2998 PDA detector coupled with a Waters Acquity ELSD and a Waters 3100 SQDMS
detector using a Waters Sunfire RP C18 column (4.6 × 150 mm, 5 μm) with a 1.0 mL/min flow
rate. 1H and 13C NMR spectra were recorded on a Bruker AVANCE III 600 MHz instrument.
Chemical shifts were reported in ppm (δ) coupling constants (J) in hertz. Chemical shifts are
reported in ppm units with Me4Si as a reference standard.
Protein expression and purification
The cDNA of full length SARS-CoV-2 3CLpro or SARS-CoV 3CLpro was cloned into the
PGEX6p-1 vector. To obtain SARS-CoV-2 3CLpro or SARS-CoV 3CLpro with authentic N
and C terminals, four amino acids (AVLQ) were inserted between the GST tag and the full
length SARS-CoV-2 3CLpro or SARS-CoV 3CLpro, while eight amino acid (GPHHHHHH)
were added to the C-terminal of SARS-CoV-2-3CLpro. The plasmid was then transformed into
BL21 (DE3) cells for protein expression. The N terminal GST tag and four amino acids (AVLQ)
was self-cleavable. The expressed protein with authentic N terminal was purified by a Ni-NTA
column (GE Healthcare) and transformed into the cleavage buffer (150 mM NaCl, 25 mM Tris,
pH 7.5) containing human rhinovirus 3C protease for removing the additional residues. The
resulting protein sample was further passed through a size exclusion chromatography
(Superdex200, GE Healthcare). The eluted protein samples were stored in a solution (10 mM
Tris, pH 7.5) for the enzymatic inhibition assay, native state mass spectrometry studies and
protein crystallization.
To obtain SARS-CoV-2-3CLpro with the GST tag, the cDNA of full length SARS-CoV-219

3CLpro was inserted after the prescission protease digestion site of the PGEX6p-1 vector. The
plasmid was transformed into BL21 (DE3) cells for protein expression. The expressed protein
was purified by a GST column (GE Healthcare) followed by the size exclusion chromatography
(Superdex200, GE Healthcare). The resulting protein was stored in a solution (25 mM Tris, pH
7.3) for the isothermal titration calorimetry measurements.
The inhibition assay of SARS-CoV-2-3CLpro
A ﬂuorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET) protease assay was applied to measure
the inhibitory activity of compounds against the SARS-CoV-2 3CLpro or SARS-CoV 3CLpro.
The fluorogenic substrate (MCA-AVLQSGFR-Lys(Dnp)-Lys-NH2) was synthesized by
GenScript (Nanjing, China). The FRET-based protease assay was performed as follows. The
recombinant SARS-CoV-2-3CLpro (30 nM at a final concentration) or SARS-CoV 3CLpro
(100 nM at a final concentration) was mixed with serial dilutions of each compound, oral liquid
or the dissolved lyophilized powder in 80 µL assay buffer (50 mM Tris–HCl, pH 7.3, 1 mM
EDTA) and incubated for 10 min. The reaction was initiated by adding 40 µL fluorogenic
substrate with a final concentration of 20 µM. After that, the fluorescence signal at 320 nm
(excitation)/405 nm (emission) was immediately measured every 30 s for 10 min with a BioTek Synergy4 plate reader. The Vmax of reactions added with compounds at various
concentrations compared to the reaction added with DMSO were calculated and used to
generate IC50 curves. For each compound, at least three independent experiments were
performed for the determination of IC50 values and each experiment was carried out in
triplicates. The IC50 values were expressed as mean ± SD from three independent experiments
and determined via the nonlinear regression analysis using GraphPad Prism software 8.0
(GraphPad Software, Inc., San Diego, CA, USA).
Separation of S. baicalensis extract
S. baicalensis decoction pieces (75 g) were boiled in 750 ml of water for 1 hour twice. After
filtration, the combined aqueous extract was evaporated under reduced pressure and the residue
was then dried by lyophilization. 455 mg of the dried extract was subjected to Waters
AutoPurification HPLC eluting with 5% ~ 60% MeCN in water containing 0.1% HCOOH from
0-40min. All of the eluent fractions were collected by automatic fraction collector and

combined by peaks on UV (280 and 320 nm) and ELSD detectors. Totally 14 fractions were
obtained with a recovery rate of 92% for the assay of SARS-CoV-2-3CLpro inhibition.
Isothermal titration calorimetry (ITC) measurements
All measurements were performed by iTC200 calorimeter (General Electric Co.) in an ITC
buffer (25 mM Tris, pH 7.3) while stirring at 800 rpm. The stock solution of compounds and
the SARS-CoV-2-3CLpro protein with a GST tag were diluted with the ITC buffer to a
compound concentration of 50-100 μM and a protein concentration of 0.6-1.5 mM before
titrations. The final concentration of DMSO in the reaction buffer is less than 2% of the total
volume. Compounds were titrated by the protein solution. All titrations were performed using
an initial injection of 0.4 μL followed by 19 identical injections of 2 μL with a duration of 4
seconds per injection and a spacing of 120 seconds between injections. The last five data points
were averaged and subtracted from each titration to account for the heat of dilution. Additional
background experiments where the protein solution was titrated into the buffer without the
compound revealed no significant shift in the baseline during the course of the measurements.
Each measurement was repeated three times.
Native state mass spectrometry studies
All mass spectrometry (MS) measurements were performed with a scimaX MRMS system
(Bruker Daltonik GmbH, Bremen, Germany). The sample solutions were infused to the system
with syringe (50 μL) at a flow rate of 120 μL/h using electrospray ionization in a positive ion
mode. Data were acquired in the mass-to-charge (m/z) range 400-6000 with a transient length
of 3.92 s in quadrupolar detection resulting in a resolving power of 54.0 ppb at m/z 3240. The
source and ion transfer parameters were optimized as follows: Skimmer 1 100 V, Funnel 1 180
V, Funnel RF Amplitude 200 V, collision cell frequency 2.0 MHz, ion transfer frequency 2
MHz, time of flight to analyzer cell 2.0 ms with RF amplitude of 350 V, and source temperature
200oC. For the protein performance optimization, the mass range around the change stated 18+
was isolated with the quadruple using a quadrupole mass window of 200 Da with a center mass
of the quadrupole of m/z 3750; the magnitude size was set to 4M; 200 single scans were added.
For ligand binding screening and dissociation constant (Kd) determination, the magnitude size
was set to 128 K and 1000 single scans were added.

The protein sample of SARS-CoV-2-3CLpro was buffer exchanged with 10 mM
ammonium acetate buffer (pH 6.8). For optimization of the MS condition, the protein was
diluted into 2 μM. For ligand binding screening studies and Kd determination, samples was
prepared with the protein at 1 μM and ligands at a series of concentrations (50, 25, 12.5, 6.25,
3.13, 1.56, 0.78 μM for baicalin and 10, 5, 2.5, 1.25, 0.63, 0.31, 0.16, 0.08 μM for baicalein).
Incubation time was 1 h at 37 ℃. Three independent experiments were performed for the
determination of Kds.
Mass spectra were deconvoluted with SNAP2 in DataAnalysis 5.2 (Bruker Daltonics,
Bremen, Germany). The charge states 18+ and 19+ have been used for calculation of the free
protein and protein-ligand complex intensities. The relative abundances of protein-ligand
complex to total protein in the mass spectra were calculated as reported previously (24).
Protein crystallization and structure determination
The purified SARS-CoV-2-3CLpro protein was concentrated to 7 mg/mL for crystallization.
One hour incubation of the protein with 10 mM baicalein was carried out before crystallization
condition screening. Crystals of the complex were obtained at 20 °C by mixing equal volumes
of protein-baicalein and a reservoir (16 % PEG6000, 100 mM MES, pH 5.8, 3% DMSO) with
a handing-drop vapor diffusion method. Crystals were flash frozen in liquid nitrogen in the
presence of the reservoir solution supplemented with 20% glycerol. X-ray diffraction data were
collected at beamline BL18U1 at the Shanghai Synchrotron Radiation Facility (25). The data
were processed with HKL3000 software packages (26). The complex structure was solved by
molecular replacement using the program PHASER (27) with a search model of PDB code
6LU7. The model was built using Coot (28) and refined with a simulated-annealing protocol
implemented in the program PHENIX (29). The refined structure was deposited to Protein Data
Bank with an accession code listed in Table S1. The complete statistics as well as the quality
of the solved structure are also shown in Table S1.
The cell-based antiviral activity assay
The Vero E6 cell line was obtained from American Type Culture Collection (ATCC,
Manassas, USA) and maintained in minimum Eagle’s medium (MEM; Gibco Invitrogen)
supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS; Invitrogen, UK) in a humid incubator with

5% CO2 at 37 °C. The cytotoxicity of two tested compounds on the Vero E6 cells were
determined by CCK8 assays (Beyotime, China). A clinical isolate SARS-CoV-2 (5) was
propagated in the Vero E6 cells, and the viral titer was determined as described previously (18).
All the infection experiments were performed at biosafety level-3 (BLS-3).
Pre-seeded Vero E6 cells (5×104 cells/well) were incubated with different concentrations of
baicalin or baicalein for 1 hour and the virus was subsequently added (a multiplicity of infection
of 0.05) to infect the cells for 2 hours. After that, the virus-compound mixture was removed
and cells were further cultured with a fresh compound containing medium. At 48 h p.i., the cell
supernatant was collected and the viral RNA in supernatant was subjected to qRT-PCR analysis
as described previously (18). DMSO was used in the controls. The experiments were performed
in triplicates and three independent experiments were carried out for each compound.
