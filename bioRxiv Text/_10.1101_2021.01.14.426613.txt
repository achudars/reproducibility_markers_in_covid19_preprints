ABSTRACT: Membrane fusion is an important step for the entry of the lipid-sheathed viruses into the host cells. The fusion
process is being carried out by fusion proteins present in the viral envelope. The class I viruses contains a 20-25 amino acid
sequence at its N-terminal of the fusion domain, which is instrumental in fusion, and is termed as ‘fusion peptide’. However,
Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus (SARS) coronaviruses contain more than one fusion peptide sequences.
We have shown that the internal fusion peptide 1 (IFP1) of SARS-CoV is far more efficient than its N-terminal counterpart
(FP) to induce hemifusion between small unilamellar vesicles. Moreover, the ability of IFP1 to induce hemifusion formation
increases dramatically with growing cholesterol content in the membrane. Interestingly, IFP1 is capable of inducing hemifusion, but fails to open pore.

Membrane fusion is a crucial step for successful entry
and infection of the enveloped viruses, leading to the
transfer of viral genetic materials into the host cell.1-5 The
fusion event is triggered by the viral fusion protein that
comes into action after the receptor binding domain interacts with the cell surface receptor proteins.6 Generally, for
class I viruses, a 20-25 amino acid stretch present in the Nterminus of the fusion protein is known as fusion peptide,
which is instrumental in binding with the host cell and
initiating the fusion process.7-8 Severe acute respiratory
syndrome (SARS) is an emerging form of pneumonia
caused by SARS-CoVs, and the entire world is now going
through a crisis due to the attack of SARS-CoV-2. The fusion domain of SARS-CoV spike protein (S2) contains three
putative fusion peptides recognized as N-terminal fusion
peptide (FP), internal fusion peptide 1 (IFP1), and internal
fusion peptide 2 (IFP2).9-13 The S2 protein contains heptad
repeats, HR1 and HR2, and a transmembrane region at the
C-terminus in addition to these fusion peptides. Interestingly, the FP and IFP1 are highly homologous between
SARS-CoV-1 and SARS-CoV-2 (Table 1). Therefore, proper
understanding of the role of FP and IFP1 in inducing membrane fusion would provide valuable mechanistic insights
of the entry of both SARS-CoV-1 and SARS-CoV-2. The
atomic resolution structure of the complex formed by two
heptad regions revealed the formation of a six-helix bundle; considered to facilitate close apposition of two fusing
membranes.14-15 Membrane composition plays a significant role in the fusion process as it alters the fusion protein or peptide conformation as well as the membrane organization and dynamics.16 The role of cholesterol in
membrane fusion is firmly established from the results
obtained from viral and model membrane fusion.17-18 Cho-

lesterol is also known to promote oligomerization of the
SARS-CoV FP.19
The lipid stalk hypothesis assumes that the sequential
evolution of the intermediates toward the opening of fusion pore. Initially, two bilayers come close and the outer
leaflets of both bilayers mix to form the stalk intermediate.
Subsequently, the inner leaflets of the apposed membranes
come in contact with each other to form transmembrane
contact, which finally undergoes mixing of inner leaflets to
open fusion pore. The stalk and transmembrane contact
structures are collectively called hemifusion intermediates.
A schematic representation of the fusion process is shown
in scheme 1.

In this work, we have studied the effectiveness of FP and
IFP1-induced fusion of small unilamellar vesicles (SUVs),
and evaluated the effect of membrane cholesterol on the
fusion process. Our results demonstrate that the IFP1
promotes lipid mixing in a cholesterol-dependent fashion.

Both the rate and extent of lipid mixing increase significantly in presence of cholesterol. On the contrary, the FP is
not that efficient to induce lipid mixing, however, there is a
slight increase in rate and extent of lipid mixing in presence of membrane cholesterol. Interestingly, both FP and
IFP1 fail to demonstrate substantial content mixing highlighting the role of other domains of S2 protein for the
pore formation. The extent of content leakage remains
about 10%, which confirms the overall integrity of fusing
membranes.
The above observation indicates that the IFP1 (and partially FP) induces hemifusion, however incapable of opening the pore between two fusing membranes. Our results
support the requirement of interaction between FP and
transmembrane domain of fusion protein for pore opening
as proposed earlier in HIV.20

In order to evaluate the effect of FP and IFP in membrane
fusion, we have measured lipid mixing, content mixing, and
content leakage kinetics using fluorescence-based methodologies described in method section (Supplementary
material). IFP1 induced about 51% of lipid mixing in
DOPC/DPOE/DOPG (60/30/10 mol%) SUVs in a lipid to
peptide 100:1. The rate and extent of lipid mixing increases with increasing cholesterol concentration, and extents
are about 71% and 84% in DOPC/DOPE/DOPG/CH
(50/30/10/10 mol%) and DOPC/DOPE/DOPG/CH
(40/30/10/20 mol%) SUVs, respectively (Figure 1A, Table-2). This result suggests that the efficiency of IFP1 in
promoting lipid mixing is extremely dependent on the concentration of membrane cholesterol. Though it promotes
significant amount of lipid mixing, does not induce content
mixing, and brings about 10% content leakage in the
membrane containing 20 mol% of cholesterol (Figure
1B&C). Putting this observation in the context of membrane fusion it is clear that the IFP1 is capable of inducing
hemifusion intermediate but unable to open the fusion
pore. The hemifusion is solely dependent on lipid mixing,
where the lipids of outer leaflets of two fusing membranes
mix with each other. A small amount of content mixing in
the hemifusion intermediate is possible as the small fluorophores can move from one membrane to the other
through the thermal fluctuation. Moderately low content
leakage indicates the

overall integrity of the membrane during the formation of
hemifusion intermediates. Interestingly, the content leakage
data saturates within about 400 seconds, which designates
that the content leakage is majorly observed during the lipid
reorganization forming the hemifusion intermediate. Similar
experiments were carried out in three different lipid compositions with the N-terminal FP, and the results are shown in
Figure 2(A-C). The FP promotes nominal amount of lipid mixing in all three lipid compositions in a lipid to peptide ratio of
100:1. The extent of content mixing and content leakage are
similar to what we observed in presence of IFP1. Overall, our
result suggests that the N-terminal FP is less efficient in promoting hemifusion, FP does not rupture the membrane as
evident from the moderately low content leakage, and content
leakage majorly takes place during the formation of the hemifusion intermediate.
Generally, for the entry of class I viruses the N-terminal FP
is considered to be crucial. Though SARS-coronaviruses belong to class I category, our results demonstrated that IFP1 is
more fusogenic than its N-terminal counterpart. The higher
fusogenicity of IFP1 could be correlated to its higher hydrophobicity compared to the N-terminal FP (Figure 3). Ten out
of sixteen (62.5%) amino acids are hydrophobic in IFP1,
whereas seven out of nineteen (36.8%) amino acids are hydrophobic in FP as per the Kyte-Doolittle hydrophobicity
scale.21 Our results further demonstrated the important role
of cholesterol in the enhancement of IFP1 and FP-induced
hemifusion; an important link between the membrane cholesterol and higher risk of viral infection. The stringency of cholesterol in class I viral infection has been shown earlier, and
our results indicate that the higher fusogenicity could be due
to the higher effectiveness of fusion peptides in inducing hemifusion intermediate in presence of cholesterol. Cholesterol
might promote membrane fusion either by modulating the
peptide conformation22,23 and depth of penetration18 or
changing membrane physical properties such as intrinsic negative curvature and stiffness.24 Cholesterol has an inverted
cone like structure that generates intrinsic negative curvature
to the membrane, which promotes the formation of nonlamellar fusion intermediates. In addition, cholesterol enhances overall membrane stiffness which provides mechanical
stability to the highly curved intermediate structures

Taken together, our work provides three important information regarding the fusion peptide-induced membrane fusion for SARS-coronaviruses. Firstly, it is clearly demonstrated that the IFP1 is more fusogenic than the FP and it could be
due to higher hydrophobicity of IFP1. Secondly, the importance of cholesterol in the peptide-induced membrane
fusion, and finally the requirement of interaction between
fusion peptide and transmembrane domain for pore opening.

up the pore.20 The limited ability of the fusion peptides to
open up pore in our study further supports the hypothesis of
interaction between fusion peptide and transmembrane domain to open the fusion pore.
