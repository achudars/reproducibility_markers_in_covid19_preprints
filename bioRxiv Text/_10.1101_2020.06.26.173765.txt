Abstract
The glycan shield of the beta-coronavirus (β-CoV) Spike (S) glycoprotein provides protection from host
immune responses, acting as a steric block to potentially neutralizing antibody responses. The
conformationally dynamic S-protein is the primary immunogenic target of vaccine design owing to its role in
host-cell fusion, displaying multiple receptor binding domain (RBD) ‘up’ and ‘down’ state configurations. Here,
we investigated the potential for RBD adjacent, N-terminal domain (NTD) glycans to influence the
conformational equilibrium of these RBD states. Using a combination of antigenic screens and high-resolution
cryo-EM structure determination, we show that an N-glycan deletion at position 234 results in a dramatically
reduced population of the ‘up’ state RBD position. Conversely, glycan deletion at position N165 results in a
discernable increase in ‘up’ state RBDs. This indicates the glycan shield acts not only as a passive hinderance
to antibody meditated immunity but also as a conformational control element. Together, our results
demonstrate this highly dynamic conformational machine is responsive to glycan modification with implications
in viral escape and vaccine design.

Introduction
The ongoing SARS-CoV-2 (SARS-2) pandemic presents an urgent need for the development of a
protective vaccine. The primary immunogenic target for the vaccines in development is the viral
transmembrane S-protein trimer. Each protomer of the trimer is split into an N-terminal receptor binding S1
subunit and a C-terminal fusion element containing S2 subunit. The S1 subunit is further split into an Nterminal domain (NTD), two subdomains (SD1 and SD2) as well as the receptor binding domain (RBD) that
together cap the conserved elements of the S2 subunit. The fusion event is marked by the shedding of the S1
subunit and large conformational transitions in the S2 subunit. The necessity to maintain a large free energy
gradient between the prefusion, immune protective state of the molecule and the post-fusion state results in a
highly dynamic macromolecular structure. The S1 subunit is particularly dynamic, presenting the RBD in two
distinct states: a receptor binding site occluded ‘down’ state in which the RBDs rest against their adjacent
protomer’s NTD, and a receptor binding site exposed ‘up’ state. It is this RBD ‘up’ state to which the majority of
neutralizing responses are observed in convalescent SARS-2 infected individuals1 As conformational evasion

is a well-known virus escape mechanism, it is critical to understand the mechanism by which these dynamics
are controlled.
Structural studies of the β-CoV S-protein have focused primarily on a soluble, ectodomain construct
with and without stabilizing proline mutations (2P). This includes structures for SARS-21,2, SARS3-7, MERS3,8,
and other human9,10 and murine11 β-CoV ectodomains. Structures for the SARS and MERS ectodomains
revealed the presence of one and two RBD ‘up’ states with a three RBD ‘up’ state observed in the MERS
ectodomain demonstrating the breadth of RBD configurations available to the spike. Interestingly, these states
were not observed in the human β-CoVs HKU1 and OC43 nor in a Murine β-CoV, suggesting mutations in the
spike protein can confer dramatic differences in the propensity of the RBD to sample its available
conformational space.
Our quantitative examination of the available β-CoV S-protein structures recently revealed the S1 and
S2 subunit domains of different β-CoV viruses occupy a diverse array of configurations12. Based upon this
analysis we predicted the S-protein conformation was particularly sensitive to mutations at the interfaces
between domains and subunits. Indeed, mutations at these sites had major impacts on the configuration of the
protein, especially on the RBD ‘up’/’down’ distribution12. While these and other studies 13,14,15 have
demonstrated the role of protein-protein contacts in determining the conformation of the S-protein, the
influence on RBD configuration of glycosylation at or near interfacial domain regions is poorly understood. Like
other class I viral fusion proteins, the β-CoV S-proteins are heavily glycosylated, obscuring the spike surface
and limiting the targetable area for immune responses. A recent site-specific analysis of the glycosylation
patterns of the SARS-2 S-protein revealed extensive variation in the glycan type, indicating marked differences
in processing enzyme accessibility at each site16. Together, the wide variation in spike conformation coupled
with the presence of glycans adjacent to the RBD suggests, among the many factors affecting the RBD
position, glycosylation patterns may provide a means by which to control its conformational equilibrium.
In this study we have investigated the potential for two SARS-2 NTD glycans in close proximity to the
RBD to influence the conformational distribution of the RBD ‘up’ and ‘down’ states. Analysis of the available
SARS-2 ‘up’ state structures suggested N165 and N234 glycans may interact with the ‘up’ state RBD acting as
both direct stabilizers of the ‘up’ state and as steric blocks to transitions to the ‘down’ state. We combined
binding studies by surface plasmon resonance, with structural studies using negative stain electron microscopy

(NSEM) and single-particle cryo-electron microscopy (cryo-EM) to define shifts in the ‘up’/’down’ state
equilibrium in glycan-deleted mutants of the SARS-2 spike ectodomain. Together, our results demonstrate that
RBD proximal glycans can influence the propensity of the S-protein adopt multiple configurations suggesting a
means for viral escape and therefore the need to consider non-RBD neutralizing responses in vaccine design.

Results
Structure analysis identifies glycans with the potential to modify the S-protein conformation
In order to establish whether glycans may indeed alter the RBD orientation, we first examined the SARS2 glycan density at positions 165 and 234 in the cryo-EM maps from three previously published SARS-2
structures2,17. In the ‘down’ state, the N234 glycan resides in a cleft formed by the NTD and RBD (Supplemental
Figure 1A) while in the ‘up’ state, it occupies the region of the RBD ‘down’ state (Figure 1A). This suggests that
the solvated ‘up’ state configuration is preferred and must be shifted in order to accommodate the ‘down’ state.
The presence of this glycan may act as a hinderance to ‘up’-to-‘down’ state transitions while sterically hindering
the ‘down’ state by limiting RBD to NTD packing. An additional glycan at N165 residing toward the apical position
of the NTD is in close proximity to the RBD and therefore may also influence the RBD position. Unlike the N234
glycan, the position of the N165 glycan presents no apparent restriction to the RBD positioning in the ‘down’
state (Supplemental Figure 1B). However, clear density for this glycan is observed occupying the region the RBD
rest in the closed state, potentially forming interactions with the ‘up’ state RBD (Figure 1A). This suggests this
glycan may act to stabilize the RBD ‘up’ state. Alternatively, its presence near the RBD in the ‘down’ state may
confer a degree of stability to the fully closed state. Together, these observations combined with our recent
results suggesting remarkable conformational sensitivity to mutations suggest these glycans may act to stabilize
the observed RBD ‘up’/’down’ equilibrium. We next asked whether RBD proximal NTD glycans occur in other βCoVs for which high-resolution structural data is available. For this, we examined structures for MERS, SARS,
OC43, HKU1, and a Murine β-CoV S-protein ectodomains (PDB IDs 5W9H, 6CRW, 6OHV, 5I08, and 3JCL,
respectively), identifying three MERS (N155, N166, and N236), two SARS-2 synonymous SARS (N158 and
N227), and one OC43 (N133), and two HKU1 (N132 and N19) glycosylation sites proximal to their respective
RBDs (Figure 1B). No RBD adjacent glycosylation sites were observed in the Murine S-protein. While the MERS
and SARS glycans display similar extensions into the RBD space in the one ‘up’ state, the lack of ‘up’ state

structures for OC43 and HKU1 precludes examination of their RBD adjacent NTD glycans in the absence of the
RBD. However, the HKU1 N132 and OC43 N133 glycans extend upward, away from the RBD suggesting these
glycans are unlikely to exert a strong influence on the RBD conformation (Supplemental Figure 1C). Interestingly,
while cryo-EM reconstructions for SARS-2, MERS, and SARS yield ‘up’ state RBDs, these states were not
reported for any of the OC43, HKU1, or Murine datasets. Together, these observations suggest RBD proximal
NTD glycans may indeed affect the conformational distribution of ‘up’/’down’ RBD states.

RBD conformation and antigenicity of the N-glycan deleted S-proteins reveals differential stabilization of RBD
‘up’ and ‘down’ states
In order to examine the extent to which the N234 and N165 glycans influence the conformational
distribution of the S-protein, we produced di-proline (2P) stabilized8 S-protein ectodomain2 N234A and N165A
mutants. The protein yields after StrepTactin purification were 2.0 mg and 0.8 mg per 1L culture supernatant,
respectively for the N234A and the N165A mutant. (Supplemental Figures 2 and 3). To assess the reactivity of
the glycan-deleted spike ectodomain mutants to the ACE-2 receptor, we tested binding of the spike to an ACE2 ectodomain construct bearing a C-terminal mouse Fc tag immobilized on an anti-Fc surface. SPR binding
assays showed that while the N165A mutant displayed ~10-20% increased binding levels to the unmutated
construct, the N234A mutant showed a decrease of ~50-60% (Figure 2A and Supplemental Figure 2B). Because
ACE-2 binding requires the RBD be in the up position, the SPR data suggests that the N165A mutant displays
more ‘up’ (or open) states, whereas the N2345A mutant displays more ‘down’ (or closed) states.
We next examined the ‘up’/’down’ state distribution of both mutants via negative stain electron
microscopy (NSEM). Heterogenous classification of the N234A mutant particles revealed a dramatic shift from
a ~1:1 ‘up’ v. ‘down’ state distribution in the unmutated 2P12,17 to a ratio of ~1:4 in the down state (Figure 2A).
Remarkably, the N165A mutant shifted the distribution in the opposite direction, displaying a higher propensity
to adopt RBD “up” states yielding a ~2:1 -‘up’ state to ‘down’ state ratio, with ~ 17% of the “up’ population being
a 2-RBD “up” class (Figure 2A). Together, the ACE-2 binding and the NSEM results demonstrated that both NTD
N-glycan deletions have distinct impacts on the RBD distribution.

High-resolution cryo-EM structures of the N-glycan deleted constructs indicates modest perturbation to S-protein
configuration
We next turned to cryo-EM for high resolution structure determination to visualize the impact of the glycan
deletions on the local and global configuration of the S-protein domains. We collected and processed 7,269 and
8,068 images for the N165A and N234A mutant, respectively, to yield particle stacks cleaned by 2D classification
and multiple rounds of ab initio classification and heterogenous refinement in cryoSPARC18 using 20 Å low pass
filtered ‘up’ state and ‘down’ state maps generated from available SARS-2 structures. Initial maps for high
resolution refinement were generated from sorted particles via ab initio reconstruction (Supplemental Figures 4
and 5). The resulting particle distribution for the N234A mutant was predominantly ‘down’ with a minor, ~6%, ‘up’
state population while that of the N165A mutant was ~50% ‘down’ and 50% one ‘up’ as was observed for the
unmutated spike previously12,17. We were unable to identify a particle subset corresponding to a two ‘up’ state in
the cryo-EM dataset. The ‘up’/’down’ state populations obtained via NSEM for unmutated12, glutaraldehyde fixed
SARS-2 S-protein ectodomain match the previously observed cryo-EM distribution17. Here, using the same
approach, we find that these distributions are dramatically and differentially shifted with mutation of either the
N165 or N234 to alanine with the SPR, NSEM, and cryo-EM distribution tracking in the same direction with the
exception of the N165A cryo-EM particles for which a two RBD ‘up’ state was not observed. Considering the
concordance between the SPR and NSEM results, this may be due to particle processing and the potential for
a relatively disordered ‘up’ state RBDs in the two ‘up’ state with the glycan deletion.
We next examined the high-resolution details of the cryo-EM maps. Refinement of the N234A mutant
‘down’ state using C3 symmetry resulted in a 3.0 Å map with coordinates fit to this map yielding a structure
aligning to the unmutated 2P structure (PDB ID 6VXX) with a ~0.6 Å RMSD. Alignment of the S2 subunit revealed
the structures to be nearly identical in these regions (RMSD ~0.4 Å). Examination of the NTD to RBD interface
using this alignment revealed a shift of the NTD toward the RBD (Figure 3A-D). Weak density for the N165
glycan was observed suggestive of an overall similar position relative to that observed previously (Figure 3B and
C) The one RBD ‘up’ state map was refined to 4.8 Å resolution using C1 symmetry. Comparison of the one RBD
‘up’ state structure fit to this map to its unmutated counterpart (PDB ID 6VYB) suggests a slight shift of the RBD
with the N234A mutation (Figure 3E and F). However, the limited resolution of this structure limits close
examination of this movement. Nevertheless, density for the N165 glycan was observed for the NTD adjacent to

the vacant RBD site (‘up’ adjacent) and for the NTD glycan adjacent to the ‘down’ state RBD proximal to the
vacant site (‘down’ free). Each occupies a configuration consistent with previous observations in the unmutated
form. Interestingly, clear density for the N165 glycan is not observed for the NTD adjacent to the ‘down’ state
RBD contacting the ‘up’ state RBD (‘down’ adjacent). Together, the structures show that the while clear
differences between the unmutated and N234A mutant are observed, the overall configuration of the structures
are similar to their respective unmutated counterparts. These differences do not appear to have significant
impacts on the N165 glycan configuration.
Refinement of the N165A ‘up’ and ‘down’ states resulted in maps with resolutions of 3.6 Å using C1
symmetry and 3.3 Å using C3 symmetry, respectively. Similar to the N234A mutant, the N165A mutant structures
showed an overall similar arrangement of the various domains. Alignment of the ‘down’ state structure of the
N165A mutant with that of the unmutated spike yielded an RMSD of 0.81 Å with an S2 subunit alignment RMSD
of 0.36 Å. Unlike the N234A mutant, the N165A mutant NTD is shifted away from the adjacent RBD (Figure 4AD). Interestingly, clear density for the N234 glycan was not observed. The one ‘up’ state structure of the N165A
mutant displayed a similar (Supplemental Figure 6), albeit slightly less shifted, arrangement of the NTD in the
‘down’ adjacent protomer (Supplemental Figure 6B). This shift in not observed in either of the other two NTDs
indicating the NTD shift is sensitive to S1 and S2 subunit arrangements (Supplemental Figure 6C and D). The
1-‘up’ RBD resides in largely the same position as that of the unmutated spike with only minor differences due
potentially to the lower relative resolution of this region (Figure 4E-H). Density for the N234 glycan was not
observed for any of the protomers, consistent with the ‘down’ state map. Together, the results of the N165A and
N234A structural analysis results suggest that these two glycans play a differential role in influencing the SARSCoV-2 RBD arrangement, shifting the NTD toward or away from the adjacent RBDs.

Discussion
Viral fusion proteins are often heavily glycosylated with the SARS-2 S-protein being no exception.
Though decorated with fewer glycans than the HIV-1 Envelope protein, with 22 glycans per protomer16, the
SARS-2 spike is well shielded from immune surveillance. The SARS-2 spike protein has proven remarkably
sensitive to domain-domain interfacial mutations12-15,19 which led us to ask whether glycans near the NTD-RBD
interface might also impact the configuration of the spike. Here, we have investigated the role of two NTD

glycans at positions 234 and 165 in modulating S protein conformational dynamics by tracking the shift of RBD
disposition in glycan-deleted mutants using binding to ACE-2 receptor, NSEM and cryo-EM analysis. While the
specific magnitudes of differences vary between the different analysis methods, the results tend to track in the
same direction showing that deletion of glycan 234 shifts the RBD dynamics more toward the “down” state,
whereas deletion of glycan 165 appears to slightly enhance the distribution toward more “up” states. The shift
in the position of the NTD toward the RBD in the ‘down’ state N234A mutant suggest the N234 glycan plays a
direct role in destabilizing the ‘down’ state RBD position such that removal allows tighter packing of the RBD to
the NTD. Additionally, the observed shift in the position of the ‘up’ state RBD suggests a role for the N234
glycan in modulating RBD stability. This is consistent with a recently released theoretical study investigating
‘up’ state RBD sensitivity to the presence of N165/N234 glycans via molecular simulation20. This investigation
found that the absence of these glycans resulted in a comparatively unstable ‘up’ state RBD. The results here
confirm the prediction from these simulations that loss of the N234 glycan results in an increased prevalence of
the ‘down’ state. Deletion of the glycan at position 165 here suggests an opposite effect on the conformation of
the spike relative to the N234A mutant, with the NTD shifting away from the adjacent RBD. Though this
appears to relieve strain caused by the restriction imposed by the N234 glycan, the resultant lack of packing
between the RBD and NTD may be sufficient to favor transitions to the ‘up’ state. Further, this shift suggests
the N165 glycan interacts directly with the RBD. Though direct interactions are not observed in the cryo-EM
densities here or in previously published SARS-2 structures, the presence of ‘down’ state conformational
heterogeneity evinced by the poor resolution of the RBD and NTD elements of the spike is consistent with the
possibility of such an interaction. A more detailed examination of this heterogeneity and the influence of these
glycans on the various states of the spike will likely require large datasets with improved orientational sampling
to better resolve these apical regions. Nevertheless, the results here demonstrate that the conformational
ensemble of the SARS-2 spike, and likely all β-CoV spikes, is sensitive to glycosylation patterns, especially
near the NTD-RBD interface.
The results from this study lend insights into two key questions – what role may the glycans at positions
165 and 234 play in modulating RBD dynamics of the native SARS-2 spike and how might these findings
impact vaccine design? Toward the first question, we recognize that the results we describe are in the context
of a stabilized, ectodomain construct and differences between these and what occurs on the spike in its native

context can be expected. Indeed, a recent report for a detergent solubilized, full-length SARS-2 spike
suggested greater stability in the ‘down’ state RBD21. Yet our experimental results revealing the role of the
N165 and N234 glycans in modulating the conformational landscape of the S protein, taken together with the
findings from the computational analysis performed in the context of the full-length spike20, and our analysis of
the RBD-proximal NTD glycans of diverse β-CoVs (Figure 1), provides strong support for a role for these
glycans in controlling the virion bound S-protein conformation and dynamics. The differences in glycosylation in
this region in different CoV spikes could be a contributor to determining their receptor specificity and thus their
transmission. Toward the second question related to the utility for vaccine design, building upon our previous
study where we demonstrated conformational control of RBD dynamics in the S protein ectodomain by
modulating inter-domain protein-protein contacts, here we expand the tools for achieving such control to
glycan-protein interactions, and demonstrate that RBD dynamics can be modulated by targeting key glycans at
interdomain contacts. In so doing, we create two new ectodomain constructs with differential exposure of the
immunodominant RBD for use as immunogens in vaccination regimens. Taken together, these investigations
further demonstrate the remarkable plasticity of this conformational machine and suggest the S-protein has a
diverse landscape of conformational escape mutations from which to select as genetic drift and host immune
pressures direct its evolution.

Methods
Protein expression and purification
The SARS-CoV-2 ectodomain constructs were produced and purified as described previously2. Briefly,
a gene encoding residues 1−1208 of the SARS-CoV-2 S (GenBank: MN908947) with proline substitutions at
residues 986 and 987, a “GSAS” substitution at the furin cleavage site (residues 682–685), a C-terminal T4
fibritin trimerization motif, an HRV3C protease cleavage site, a TwinStrepTag and an 8XHisTag was
synthesized and cloned into the mammalian expression vector pαH. All mutants were introduced in this
background. Expression plasmids encoding the ectodomain sequence were used to transiently transfect
FreeStyle293F cells using Turbo293 (SpeedBiosystems). Protein was purified on the sixth day posttransfection from the filtered supernatant using StrepTactin resin (IBA).
The ACE-2 gene was cloned as a fusion protein with a mouse Fc region attached to its C-terminal end.
A 6X His-tag was added to the C-terminal end of the Fc domain. ACE-2 with mouse FC tag was purified by NiNTA chromatography.

Thermal shift assay
The thermal shift assay was performed using Tycho NT. 6 (NanoTemper Technologies). Spike variants
were diluted (0.15 mg/ml) in nCoV buffer (2mM Tris, pH 8.0, 200 mM NaCl, 0.02% sodium azide) and run in
duplicates in capillary tubes. Intrinsic fluorescence was recorded at 330 nm and 350 nm while heating the
sample from 35–95 °C at a rate of 3 °C/min. The ratio of fluorescence (350/330 nm) and the Ti were calculated
by Tycho NT. 6.
Cryo-EM sample preparation, data collection and processing
Purified SARS-CoV-2 spike preparations were diluted to a concentration of ~1 mg/mL in 2 mM Tris pH 8.0, 200
mM NaCl and 0.02% NaN3. 2.5 µL of protein was deposited on a CF-1.2/1.3 grid that had been glow
discharged for 30 seconds in a PELCO easiGlow™ Glow Discharge Cleaning System. After a 30 s incubation
in >95% humidity, excess protein was blotted away for 2.5 seconds before being plunge frozen into liquid
ethane using a Leica EM GP2 plunge freezer (Leica Microsystems). Frozen grids for the N234A mutant were
imaged in a Titan Krios (Thermo Fisher) equipped with a K3 detector (Gatan) while those for the N165A mutant
were image in a Titan Krios equipped with a Falcon 3EC detector. Data were acquired using the Leginon
system23 (N234A) or the EPU software (Thermo Fisher Scientific; N165A). The dose was fractionated over 50
raw frames and collected at 50ms framerate. This dataset was energy-filtered with a slit width of 30 eV for the
N234A mutant. Individual frames were aligned and dose-weighted24. CTF estimation, particle picking, 2D
classifications, ab initio model generation, heterogeneous refinements, homogeneous 3D refinements and
local resolution calculations were carried out in cryoSPARC25.

Cryo-EM structure fitting and analysis
Structures of the all ‘down’ state (PDB ID 6VXX) and single RBD ‘up’ state (PDB ID 6VYB) from the previously
published SARS-CoV-2 ectodomain were used to fit the cryo-EM maps in Chimera26. Mutations were made in
PyMol27. Coordinates were fit to the maps first using ISOLDE28 followed by iterative refinement using Phenix29
real space refinement and subsequent manual coordinate fitting in Coot as needed. Structure and map
analysis were performed using PyMol, Chimera26 and ChimeraX30.

Surface Plasmon Resonance
The binding of ACE-2 to the SARS-2 spike constructs was assessed by surface plasmon resonance on
Biacore T-200 (GE-Healthcare) at 25°C with HBS-EP+ (10 mM HEPES, pH 7.4, 150 mM NaCl, 3 mM EDTA,
and 0.05% surfactant P-20) as the running buffer. ACE-2 tagged at its C-terminal end to a mouse Fc region
was captured on an anti-Fc surface. Binding was assessed by flowing over different concentrations of the spike
constructs over the ACE-2 surface. The surface was regenerated between injections by flowing over 3M
MgCl2 solution for 10s with flow rate of 100µl/min.. Blank sensorgrams were obtained by injection of the same
volume of HBS-EP+ buffer in place of IgGs and Fab solutions. Sensorgrams were corrected with
corresponding blank curves. Sensorgram data were analyzed using the BiaEvaluation software (GE
Healthcare).
