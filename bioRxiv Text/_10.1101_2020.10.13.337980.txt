Abstract
Substitution for aspartic acid by glycine at position 614 in the spike (S) protein of severe
acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), the causative agent of the
ongoing pandemic, appears to facilitate rapid viral spread. The G614 variant has now
replaced the D614-carrying virus as the dominant circulating strain. We report here cryoEM structures of a full-length S trimer carrying G614, which adopts three distinct
prefusion conformations differing primarily by the position of one receptor-binding
domain (RBD). A loop disordered in the D614 S trimer wedges between domains within
a protomer in the G614 spike. This added interaction appears to prevent premature
dissociation of the G614 trimer, effectively increasing the number of functional spikes
and enhancing infectivity. The loop transition may also modulate structural
rearrangements of S protein required for membrane fusion. These findings extend our
understanding of viral entry and suggest an improved immunogen for vaccine
development.

Introduction
Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), an enveloped positivestranded RNA virus, is the cause of the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic. It probably
originated when related viruses circulating in bats acquired the ability to infect human
cells1. While viral evolution is believed to be slow, owing to the RNA proofreading
capability of its replication machinery2, a variant with a single-residue substitution
(D614G) in its spike protein has rapidly become the dominant strain throughout the
world3. Understanding the molecular features of the now most prevalent virus strain can
guide intervention strategies to control the crisis.
SARS-CoV-2 initiates infection by fusion of its envelope lipid bilayer with the membrane
of a host cell. This critical step in the viral life cycle is catalyzed by the trimeric spike (S)
protein, which is produced as a single-chain precursor and subsequently processed by a
furin-like protease into the receptor-binding fragment S1 and the fusion fragment S24.
After engagement of the receptor-binding domain (RBD) in S1 with the viral receptor
angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) on the host cell surface, followed by a second
proteolytic cleavage within S2 (S2’ site)5, the S protein undergoes large conformational
changes, prompting dissociation of S1 and irreversible refolding of S2 into a postfusion
structure6,7. Formation of the postfusion S2 provides energy for overcoming the kinetic
barrier of membrane fusion and effectively brings the viral and cellular membranes close
together to induce fusion of the two.
Rapid advances in the structural biology of the SARS-CoV-2 S protein, an important
target for development of diagnostics, therapeutics and vaccines, include structures of S
protein fragments derived from the original virus carrying D614: the S ectodomain
stabilized in its prefusion conformation8,9, RBD-ACE2 complexes10-13, and segments of
S2 in the postfusion state14. In the prefusion ectodomain structure, S1 folds into four
domains - NTD (N-terminal domain), RBD, and two CTDs (C-terminal domains), and
wraps around the prefusion conformation of S2, with the RBD sampling two distinct
conformations – “up” for a receptor-accessible state and “down” for a receptorinaccessible state. We and others have also reported structures of a purified, full-length

D614 S protein in both prefusion and postfusion conformations15,16. Studies by cryoelectron tomography, with chemically inactivated SARS-CoV-2 preparations, using both
D614 and G614 variants have revealed additional structural details of S proteins present

outcompeted the original virus and became the globally dominant form within a
month3,21,22. This single-residue substitution appears to correlate with high viral loads in
infected patients and high infectivity of pseudotyped viruses, but not with disease
severity3. The G614 virus has comparable (or even slightly higher) sensitivity to
neutralization by convalescent human sera or vaccinated hamster sera3,23-25, suggesting
that the response to vaccination with immunogens containing D614 remains effective
against the new strain. Further studies have demonstrated that S1 dissociates more readily
from the D614 virus than from G614 virus26, indicating that the D614 viral spike is
substantially less stable than the G614 variant. The stabilized, soluble S ectodomain
trimer with G614 samples the RBD-up conformations more frequently than does the
D614 trimer25,27, but it is puzzling why the former binds more weakly to recombinant
ACE2 than the latter27. The known S trimer structures indicate that the D614G change
breaks a salt bridge between D614 and a positively charged residue (K854) in the fusion
peptide proximal region (FPPR)15, which may help clamp the RBD in the prefusion
conformation. This observation can explain why the G614 trimer favors the RBD-up
conformations, but does not account for its increased stability. To resolve these issues,
which relate directly to viral entry mechanism and to vaccine development, we report
here the structural consequences of the D614G substitution in the context of the fulllength S protein.

Results
Characteristics of the full-length SARS-CoV-2 S protein carrying G614
Following our established protocols for producing the full-length S protein containing
D614 solubilized in detergent15, we transfected HEK293 cells with a construct expressing
a full-length wildtype SARS-CoV-2 S with G614. We compared the membrane fusion

activity of the G614 S protein with that of the full-length D614 S construct in a βgalactosidase-based cell-cell fusion assay15. As shown in Fig. S1A, all the cells
expressing S fused efficiently with cells transfected with a human ACE2 construct,
demonstrating that the S proteins expressed on the cell surfaces are fully functional. At
the low transfection levels, the G614 S had higher fusion activity than the D614 S, but the
difference diminished with the increased amount of transfected DNA, suggesting that the
high expression levels can compensate for any possible defects that associated with the
D614 S protein. We also tested inhibition of the cell-cell fusion by an engineered trimeric
ACE2-based inhibitor that competes with the receptor on the target cells28, showing that
the G614 trimer is slightly more sensitive than the D614 trimer (Fig. S1B).
To purify the full-length S protein, we used an expression construct fused with a Cterminal strep-tag, which was equally active in cell-cell fusion as the untagged version
(Fig. S1A), and purified both G614 and D614 proteins under identical conditions. We
lysed the transfected cells and solubilized membrane-bound proteins in 1% detergent
dodecyl-β-D-maltopyranoside (DDM), purified the strep-tagged S proteins by elution
from strep-tactin resin in 0.3% DDM followed by gel filtration chromatography in 0.02%
DDM. The D614 protein eluted in three peaks representing the prefusion S trimer, the
postfusion S2 trimer and the dissociated monomeric S1, respectively, as we have reported
previously15. The G614 protein eluted as a single major peak, corresponding to the
prefusion S trimer (Fig. 1A). Coomassie-stained SDS-PAGE analysis confirmed that the
G614 peak contained mainly the cleaved S1/S2 complex (~90%) and a small amount of
the uncleaved S precursor (~10%). We found similar patterns when the two proteins were
purified in detergent NP-40, indicating that the choice of detergent had not affected the
relative stability of the two spike variants. We conclude that the single-residue
substitution has a striking effect on the stability of the SARS-CoV-2 S trimer, even as a
purified protein.
We measured by bio-layer interferometry (BLI) binding of the prefusion trimer fractions
of the full-length proteins to recombinant soluble ACE2 (Fig. 1B). The S trimers bound
more strongly to a dimeric ACE2 than to a monomeric ACE2, as expected. The G614

protein bound ACE2 less tightly than did the D614 protein, consistent with the
measurements reported by others using soluble constructs27. This observation appears
inconsistent with reports that the G614 trimer has a more exposed RBD than the D614
trimer17,18,25,27.
Cryo-EM structures of the full-length S trimer with G614
We determined the cryo-EM structures of the full-length S trimer carrying G614 in both
DDM and NP-40. Cryo-EM images were acquired on a Titan Krios electron microscope
operated at 300 keV and equipped with a Gatan K3 direct electron detector. We used
RELION29 for particle picking, two-dimensional (2D) classification, three dimensional
(3D) classification and refinement. 3D classification identified three distinct classes each
containing a similar number of particles. The three classes represent a closed, three RBDdown conformation, a one RBD-up conformation and an intermediate conformation with
one RBD flipped up only halfway. All structures were refined to 3.1-3.5 Å resolution
(Fig. S2-S5; Table S2). The same three classes were observed for the samples purified in
both detergents, giving essentially identical maps of the corresponding classes after
refinement (Fig. S6). These results demonstrate that detergent has little impact on the S
structure at least in the visible regions of the ectodomain.
The overall structure of the full-length S protein with G614 in the closed, three RBDdown prefusion conformation is very similar to that of the D614 S trimer that we have
published recently (Fig. 2; ref15). In the three RBD-down structure, the four domains in
each S1, including NTD, RBD, CTD1 and CTD2, wrap around the three-fold axis of the
trimer, protecting the prefusion S2. The furin cleavage site at the S1/S2 boundary remains
disordered, making it difficult to determine whether this structure represents the
uncleaved or cleaved trimer, although the preparation contains primarily the cleaved
forms (Fig. 1A). The S2 fragment folds around a central three-stranded coiled coil that
forms the most stable part of the structure with the strongest density in the entire S trimer;
it is also the least variable region among all the known S trimer structures. The S2
structure is identical in the two structures of the G614 trimer with one RBD projecting
upwards, either completely or partially (Figs. S7 and S8A). In the conformation with one

RBD fully up, the two neighboring NTDs, including the one from the same protomer,
shift away from the three-fold axis (Fig. S7). In the RBD-intermediate conformation,
only the NTD from the adjacent protomer packing directly against the moving RBD
shifted, suggesting that there is at least one local free-energy minimum along the pathway
of the RBD upward movement.
The D614G substitution eliminates a salt bridge between residue 614 in CTD2 of one
subunit and residue 854 in the FPPR of the adjacent subunit, probably destabilizing the
latter15. Nonetheless, the FPPR in the three RBD-down conformation of the G614 trimer
is structured, although the density in the regions is slightly weaker than in the D614 map
(Fig. S8B). A major difference between the G614 and D614 trimer structures is that a
~20-residue segment (620-640) in the CTD2, largely disordered in the D614 trimer, has
become structured in the G614 trimer. There is no density for the C-terminal segments,
including HR2, TM and CT, consistent with the flexibility near residue Pro1162 found in
cryo-ET studies17,18.
Structural consequences of the D614G substitution
To examine the structural changes resulted from the D614G substitution, we superposed
the structures of the G614 trimer onto the D614 trimer in the closed conformation
aligning them by the invariant S2 (Fig. 2B). A shift by a clockwise, outward rotation of
all three S1 subunits, relative to the D614 structure, is evident even for the G614 trimer in
the closed conformation. A similar shift was also observed in the RBD-intermediate and
RBD-up G614 structures. Thus, the D614G substitution has led to a slightly more open
conformation than that of the D614 trimer, even when all three RBDs are down. The
D614G change has apparently also rigidified a neighboring segment of CTD2, residues
620-640, which we designate the "630 loop". This loop inserts into a gap, slightly wider
in the G614 than in the D614 trimer, between the NTD and CTD1 of the same protomer
(Figs. 3 and 4). The 630 loop is disordered in the closed D614 trimer, because the gap
narrows enough to exclude it. The close D614 trimer thus has three ordered FPPRs and
three disordered 630 loops, while in the closed G614 trimer structures reported here, the
three 630 loops and three FPPRs in the closed conformation are all structured. In the two

conformers with one partly or fully open RBD, the two segments are disordered in the
RBD-shifted subunit, and their central parts have difficult-to-model density in one other
subunit. The third pair appears well ordered throughout. Thus, opening of the RBD in the
full-length, G614 trimer correlates with a displacement of the 630 loop and the FPPR
away from their positions in the D614 variant, making them too mobile to be detected in
our cryo-EM reconstructions.
In the immediate vicinity of residue 614, the change from Asp to Gly did not cause any
large local structural rearrangements except for loss of the D614-K854 salt bridge we had
previously predicted15, and a small shift of residue 614 towards the three-fold axis (Fig.
4A). The position of the FPPR and the conformation of K854 allow a hydrogen bond
between K854Nη and the main-chain carbonyl of G614, perhaps accounting for the
subtlety of the structural difference. The loss of the salt bridge involving D614, at least
partially compensated by the new hydrogen bond between G614 and K854, was
apparently not sufficient to destabilize the packing of the FPPR against the rest of the
trimer, but it did weaken the FPPR density, especially between residues 842-846. The
630 loop, which packs directly against the NTD, CTD1 and CTD2 of the same protomer,
lies close to the S1/S2 boundary of the same protomer and the FPPR of an adjacent
protomer (Fig. 4B). The loop inserts between the NTD and CTD1 (Fig. 4C), probably
requiring the shifts illustrated in Fig. 2B. This wedge-like loop may also help secure the
NTD and CTDs and enhance G614 S trimer stability.
CTD2 is formed by two stacked, four-strand β-sheets, with a fifth strand in one sheet
contributed by the connector between the NTD and RBD. In the other sheet, an
interstrand loop contains the S1/S2 cleavage site, and thus one strand is the N-terminal
segment of S2 (Fig. 4B). In the G614 trimer, one side of the 630 loop packs along a long
hydrophobic surface, largely solvent-exposed in the D614 trimer, formed by residues on
the "upward" facing surface of the CTD2 along with Pro295 from the NTD (Fig. 4D).
Pro631, Trp633 and Val635 of the 630 loop appear to contribute to this interaction. Since
S1 dissociation from S2 likely requires destabilization of the CTD2 to free the β-strand
from the N-terminal end of S2, an ordered 630 loop that completes folding of the CTD2

by closing off an exposed, hydrophobic surface may retard S1 shedding, thereby
enhancing the stability of a cleaved S trimer.
We note that although S1 in the G614 trimer moves outwards from its position in the
D614 trimer, the extent of the shift is still appreciably smaller than the shift seen in
soluble S trimers stabilized by a trimerization foldon tag and two proline mutations (Fig.
S9). The comparison suggests that the soluble trimer may not completely mimic all the
physiologically relevant conformations of the S trimer.

Discussion
Structural basis of increased stability and infectivity of the G614 spike
The structures described here allow us to propose an explanation why the virus carrying
the D614G substitution, with a more stable S trimer, is more infectious than the original
strain. We consider the schematic free energy landscape of the S-protein conformational
distribution in Fig. 5. In the D614 trimer, the kinetic barrier for transition from the RBDdown conformation, clamped by the FPPR only, to the RBD-up conformation, is
relatively low, and so is for the barrier for the subsequent irreversible transition to the
postfusion S2 and dissociated S1. The second transition can occur even in the absence of
ACE2, as seen on the surfaces of pseudotyped viruses and inactivated SARS-CoV-2 that
carry D61420,26, as well as our recent study15. Since the RBD-up conformation could
either revert to the closed state or dissociate irreversibly to allow transition to the
postfusion state, it is not surprising that very few such particles were captured in our
previous cryo-EM study or in the cryo-ET study of the inactivated virus using the D614
variant15,20. Instead, the closed prefusion conformation and the postfusion conformation
were the principal species observed. In the G614 trimer, the RBD-down conformation is
reinforced not only by the FPPR but also by the newly identified 630 loop, substantially
raising the barrier for the closed-to-open transition of the RBD. Local free energy minima
could trap some RBD intermediate conformations, perhaps accounting for the RBDintermediate captured here.

Our interpretation of the structural differences is also consistent with the spike
conformational distribution on the virions in cryo-ET studies of chemically inactivated
SARS-CoV-2. The D614 preparation contains primarily postfusion S2 spikes20. One
study of a G614 virus that had lost the furin cleavage site showed almost no postfusion
spikes, and a 50:50 distribution of prefusion spikes between fully closed and one RBDup17; and another showed 3% postfusion spikes and 97% in the prefusion form (~31%,
fully closed; ~55%, one RBD-up; ~14% two RBD-up)18. The structured 630 loop in the
G614 trimer not only reinforces the packing among three protomers by inserting between
the NTD and CTD1 of the same protomer but also seals a hydrophobic surface of the
CTD2. The latter interaction probably stabilizes the domain and thus inhibits release of
the N-terminal segment of S2, effectively blocking S1 dissociation. This property can
account for the paucity of postfusion spikes on the G614 variant.
Our data can also explain why the G614 trimer binds somewhat less tightly to ACE2 than
does the D614 trimer, despite the greater proportion of well-exposed RBDs, both as seen
here and as reported by others17,18,25,27. The higher kinetic barrier for an upward shift in
the RBD than that in the D614 trimer would create a significant hurdle for the rest of
RBDs in the same G614 trimer or the closed G614 trimers to adopt an ACE2-accessible
state. We note that the second binding event with the dimeric ACE2 has a slower on-rate
and also a slower off-rate for the G614 than the D614 trimer (Table S1).It is therefore not
surprising that the G614 trimer preparation showed weaker binding to both monomeric
and dimeric ACE2 than did a D614 S preparation. We suggest that the enhanced
infectivity of the G614 virus largely results from the increased stability of the S trimer,
rather than the better exposed RBDs. Indeed, if the virus that passed from bats to humans
or to an intermediate vector contained D614 (also present in the bat coronavirus BatCoV
RaTG131), then it could have gained fitness in the new host by acquiring changes such as
G614 for greater stability and infectivity than the parental form.
Membrane fusion mechanism
We previously hypothesized that the FPPR might modulate the fusogenic structural
rearrangements of S protein, as it retains the RBDs in the down conformation but moves

out of its position when the RBD flips up. The current study has shown that additional
structures, CTD2 and the 630 loop within it, are probably key components of the S fusion
machinery. If ACE2 captures the RBD-up conformation, expelling both the 630 loop and
the FPPR from their positions in the closed S trimer conformation, the FPPR shift may
help expose the S2’ site near the fusion peptide for proteolytic cleavage, while departure
of the 630 loop from the hydrophobic surface of the CTD2 can destabilize this domain
and free the N-terminal segment of S2 to dissociate from S1, if the furin site has already
been cleaved, and release S1 altogether. Dissociation of S1 would then initiate a cascade
of refolding events in the metastable prefusion S2, allowing the fusogenic transition to a
stable postfusion structure. We note that this model is very similar to that proposed for
membrane fusion catalyzed by HIV envelope protein, in which gp120 dissociation
triggers refolding of gp41 to complete the fusion process30.
Implications for vaccine development
The SARS-CoV-2 S protein is the centerpiece of almost all the first-generation vaccines,
being developed, which began at early stages in the pandemic and used the D614
sequence. We have previously suggested that the inactivated-virus vaccines might have
too many postfusion spikes and induce mainly non-neutralizing antibodies15. Indeed,
these vaccine candidates induced the lowest level of neutralizing antibody responses;
other S constructs containing stabilization modifications to prevent conformational
changes have given much stronger responses31, but their protective efficacy still needs to
be evaluated in phase 3 clinical trials. The G614 S trimer is naturally constrained in a
prefusion state that presents both the RBD-down and RBD-up conformations with great
stability. It is therefore likely to be a superior immunogen, whether in a protein or nucleic
acid form, for eliciting protective neutralizing antibody responses, which appear largely
to target the RBD and NTD32,33.

Methods
Expression constructs
Genes of a full-length spike (S) protein (residue 1-1273) of SARS-CoV-2 (D614) and the
ectodomain of human angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE2; residue 1-615) were
synthesized by GenScript (Piscataway, NJ). The S gene was fused with a C-terminal twin
Strep tag [(GGGGS)2WSHPQFEK(GGGGS)2WSHPQFEK)] and cloned into a
mammalian cell expression vector pCMV-IRES-puro (Codex BioSolutions, Inc,
Gaithersburg, MD). The D614G substation in the S gene was generated by site-specific
mutagenesis and confirmed by DNA sequencing. The ACE2 gene added a C-terminal
6xhistidine tag and cloned into the same expression vector. The dimeric ACE2 construct
was kindly provided by Dr. Michael Farzan at Scripps Research Institute.
Expression and purification of recombinant proteins
Expression and purification of the full-length S protein carrying G614 were carried out as
previously described15. Briefly, expi293F cells were transiently transfected with the S
protein expression construct. To purify the S protein, the transfected cells were lysed in a
buffer containing Buffer A (100 mM Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 150 mM NaCl, 1 mM EDTA) and
1% (w/v) n-dodecyl-β-D-maltopyranoside (DDM) (Anatrace, Inc. Maumee, OH), EDTAfree complete protease inhibitor cocktail (Roche, Basel, Switzerland), and incubated at
4°C for one hour. After a clarifying spin, the supernatant was loaded on a strep-tactin
column equilibrated with the lysis buffer. The column was then washed with 50 column
volumes of Buffer A and 0.3% DDM, followed by additional washes with 50 column
volumes of Buffer A and 0.1% DDM, and with 50 column volumes of Buffer A and
0.02% DDM. The S protein was eluted by Buffer A containing 0.02% DDM and 5 mM
desthiobiotin. The protein was further purified by gel filtration chromatography on a
Superose 6 10/300 column (GE Healthcare) in a buffer containing 25 mM Tris-HCl, pH
7.5, 150 mM NaCl, 0.02% DDM. Similar purification was also performed using

Expi293F cells transfected with monomeric ACE2 or dimeric ACE2 expression construct
were grown in 250 ml roller bottles with DMEM containing 10% FBS. The supernatant

of the cell culture was collected by centrifugation at 2,524 xg for 30 minutes. The
monomeric ACE2 was purified by affinity chromatography using Ni-NTA agarose
(Qiagen, Hilden, Germany), followed by gel filtration chromatography, as described
previously34,35. The peak fractions were pooled and concentrated to 10  mg/ml using a
30  kDa MWCO Millipore filter (MilliporeSigma, Burlington, MA). The supernatant of
dimeric ACE2 was loaded to a column packed with GammaBind Plus Sepharose beads
(GE Healthcare). The column was washed with PBS. The protein was eluted using 100
mM glycine (pH 2.5) and neutralized immediately with 2 M Tris-HCl (pH 8.0). The
eluted protein was further purified by gel filtration chromatography on a Superdex 200
Increase 10/300 GL column. The peak fractions were pooled and concentrated to 5 mg/ml
using a 50kDa MWCO Millipore filter.

Binding assay by bio-layer interferometry (BLI)
Binding of monomeric or dimeric ACE2 to the full-length Spike protein was measured
using an Octet RED384 system (ForteBio, Fremont, CA). Each ACE2 protein was diluted
using the running buffer (PBS, 0.02% Tween 20, 1 mg/ml BSA) and transferred to a 96well plate. The full-length S protein was immobilized to Amine Reactive 2nd Generation
(AR2G) biosensors (ForteBio), following a protocol recommended by the manufacturer.
After equilibrating in the running buffer for 5 minutes, the sensors with immobilized
Spike protein were dipped in the wells containing the ACE2 protein at various
concentrations (5.56-450 nM for monomeric ACE2; 2.78-225 nM for dimeric ACE2) for
5 minutes to measure the association rate. The sensors were then dipped in the running
buffer for 10 minutes to determine the dissociation rate. Control sensors with no Spike
protein were also dipped in the ACE2 solutions and the running buffer as references.
Recorded sensorgrams with background subtracted from the references were analyzed
using the software Octet Data Analysis HT Version 11.1 (ForteBio). The curves for
monomeric ACE2 were fit to a 1:1 binding model, while those for dimeric ACE2 were fit
to a bivalent binding model.
Cell-cell fusion assay

The cell-cell fusion assay, based on the α-complementation of E. coli β-galactosidase,
was conducted to quantify the fusion activity mediated by SARS-CoV2 S protein, as
described15. Briefly, various amount of the full-length SARS-CoV2 (614D or 614G) S
construct (0.025-10 µg) and the α fragment of E. coli β-galactosidase construct (10 µg),
or the full-length ACE2 construct (10 µg) together with the ω fragment of E. coli βgalactosidase construct (10 µg), were transfected to HEK293T cells using
Polyethylenimine (PEI) (80 µg). After a 24-hour incubation at 37°C, the cells were
detached using DPBS buffer with 5mM EDTA and resuspended in complete DMEM
medium. 50 µl S-expressing cells (1.0x106 cells/ml) were mixed with 50 µl ACE2expressing cells (1.0x106 cells/ml) to allow the cell-cell fusion proceed at 37 °C for 2
hours. Cell-cell fusion activity was quantified using a chemiluminescent assay system,
Gal-Screen (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA), following the standard protocol
recommended by the manufacturer. The substrate was added to the mixture of the cells
and allowed to react for 90 minutes in dark at room temperature. The luminescence signal
was recorded with a Synergy Neo plate reader (Biotek).
For the inhibition assay, the S-expressing cells were incubated with trimeric ACE2
variant, ACE2615-foldon T27W28, at varied concentrations (6.25-200 µg/ml) for 1 hour at
37°C. After the incubation, the ACE2-expressing cells were added to the mixture,
followed with a 2-hour incubation at 37 °C. The fusion activity was quantified using the
Gal-Screen system as mentioned above.
Cryo-EM sample preparation and data collection.
To prepare cryo grids, 3.5 µl of the freshly purified G614 sample in NP-40 at ~0.3
mg/ml was applied to a 1.2/1.3 Quantifoil grid with continuous carbon support
(Quantifoil Micro Tools GmbH), which had been glow discharged with a PELCO
easiGlowTM Glow Discharge Cleaning system (Ted Pella, Inc.) for 60 s at 15 mA. For
the G614 sample in DDM, 3.5 µl of the peak fraction from gel filtration
chromatography at ~1.0 mg/ml was also applied to the glow discharged 1.2/1.3
Quantifoil grids (Quantifoil Micro Tools Gmb). Grids were immediately plunge-frozen
in liquid ethane using a Vitrobot Mark IV (ThermoFisher Scientific), and excess

protein was blotted away by using grade 595 filter paper (Ted Pella, Inc.) with a
blotting time of 4 s, a blotting force of -12 at 4

in 100% humidity. The grids were

first screened for ice thickness and particle distribution using a Talos Arctica
transmission electron microscope (ThermoFisher Scientific), operated at 200 keV and
equipped with a K3 direct electron detector (Gatan). For data collection, images were
acquired with selected grids using a Titan Krios transmission electron microscope
(ThermoFisher Scientific) operated at 300 keV and equipped with a BioQuantum
GIF/K3 direct electron detector. Automated data collection was carried out using
SerialEM version6536 at a nominal magnification of 105,000× and the K3 detector in
counting mode (calibrated pixel size, 0.825 Å) at an exposure rate of ~14.7 electrons
per physical pixel per second for the two different detergent samples (14.77 and 14.68,
respectively). Each movie had a total accumulated electron exposure of ~50 e/Å2,
fractionated in 50 frames (50 ms per frame). Datasets were acquired using a defocus
range of 1.5-2.7 µm for the NP-40 sample and 1.0-2.5 µm for the DDM sample.

Image processing and 3D reconstructions
Drift correction for cryo-EM images was performed using MotionCor237, and contrast
transfer function (CTF) was estimated by CTFFIND438 using motion-corrected sums
without dose-weighting. Motion corrected sums with dose-weighting were used for all
other image processing. RELION3.0.8 was used for particle picking, 2D classification,
3D classification and refinement procedure. Approximately 3,000 particles were
manually picked for each protein sample and subjected to 2D classification to generate
the templates for automatic particle picking. For the NP-40 sample, after manual
inspection of auto-picked particles, a total of 3,640,242 particles were extracted from
11,577 images. The selected particles were subjected to 2D classification, giving a
total of 2,657,624 good particles. A low-resolution negative-stain reconstruction of the
sample was low-pass filtered to 30Å resolution and used as an initial model for 3D
classification with C3 symmetry. One major class showed clear structural features
were subjected to another round of 3D classification with C1 symmetry, giving one
major class. Third round of 3D classification with C1 symmetry and further local
angular search produced three major classes, representing the closed, three RBD-down

conformation, the one RBD-up conformation and the RBD-intermediate conformation,
respectively. The three classes were then subjected to 3D auto-refinement, followed by
particle polishing and signal-subtraction classification focused on the apex region of
the S trimer. The three classes containing 63,558, 86,353 and 93,426 particles were
subjected to 3D refinement with C1 (RBD-intermediate and RBD-up) and C3 (closed)
symmetry using an overall mask, resulting in three final reconstructions at 3.3Å, 3.5Å
and 3.1Å resolutions, respectively. For the DDM sample, a total of 5,652,781 particles
were extracted from 11,092 images by reference-based auto-picking. Two rounds of
2D classification were performed, giving 3,207,721 good particles. These particles
were subjected to two rounds of 3D classification with C3 symmetry, yielding one
major class with clear structural features. The refined map from the first dataset was
low-pass filtered to 30Å resolution and used as the initial model for 3D classification.
A third round of 3D classification with C1 symmetry and further local angular search
were performed, generating three major classes, which are similar to those from the
NP-40 sample. CTF refinement and Bayesian polishing were performed for these
classes. The RBD-up class containing 55,537 particles gave a 3D reconstruction at
3.2Å resolution after 3D auto-refine with C1 symmetry and overall mask; the RBDintermediate class with 63,040 particles and the closed conformation class with 55,096
particles were subjected to the same refinement strategy, yielding 3D maps with
resolution at 3.2Å and 3.4Å. The best map from each class was used for model
building.

Reported resolutions are based on the gold-standard Fourier shell correlation (FSC)
using the 0.143 criterion. All density maps were corrected from the modulation
transfer function of the K3 detector and then sharpened by applying a temperature
factor that was estimated using post-processing in RELION. Local resolution was
determined using RELION with half-reconstructions as input maps.

The initial templates for model building used the stabilized SARS-CoV-2 S
ectodomain trimer structure (PDB ID 6XR8) for the prefusion conformation. Several
rounds of manual building were performed in Coot39. The model was then refined in
Phenix40 against the 3.1Å (closed), 3.2Å (RBD-intermediate) and 3.5Å (RBD-up)
cryo-EM maps. Iteratively, refinement was performed in both Phenix (real space

Figure 1. Characterization of the purified full-length SARS-CoV-2 S proteins. (A)
The full-length SARS-CoV-2 S protein carrying either D614 or G614 was extracted and
purified in detergent DDM, and further resolved by gel-filtration chromatography on a
Superose 6 column. The molecular weight standards include thyoglobulin (670 kDa), γglobulin (158 kDa) and ovalbumin (44 kDa). Inset, peak fractions were analyzed by
Coomassie stained SDS-PAGE. Labeled bands are S, S1 and S2. Fr#, fraction number.
(B) Binding analysis of fractions of Peak 1 in (A) with soluble ACE2 constructs by biolayer interferometry (BLI). The purified S proteins were immobilized to AR2G
biosensors and dipped into the wells containing ACE2 at various concentrations (5.56450 nM for monomeric ACE2, 2.78-225 nM for dimeric ACE2). Binding kinetics was
evaluated using a 1:1 Langmuir binding model for the monomeric ACE2 and a bivalent
model for dimeric ACE2. The sensorgrams are in black and the fits in red. Binding
constants are also summarized here and in Table S1. All experiments were repeated at
least twice with essentially identical results.
