Abstract:
The ongoing pandemic caused by coronavirus SARS-COV-2 continues to rage with devastating
consequences on human health and global economy. The spike glycoprotein on the surface of coronavirus
mediates its entry into host cells and is the target of all current antibody design efforts to neutralize the
virus. The glycan shield of the spike helps the virus to evade the human immune response by providing a
thick sugar-coated barrier against any antibody. To study the dynamic motion of glycans in the spike protein,
we performed microsecond-long MD simulation in two different states that correspond to the receptor
binding domain in open or closed conformations. Analysis of this microsecond-long simulation revealed a
scissoring motion on the N-terminal domain of neighboring monomers in the spike trimer. Role of multiple
glycans in shielding of spike protein in different regions were uncovered by a network analysis, where the
high betweenness centrality of glycans at the apex revealed their importance and function in the glycan
shield. Microdomains of glycans were identified featuring a high degree of intra-communication in these
microdomains. An antibody overlap analysis revealed the glycan microdomains as well as individual
glycans that inhibit access to the antibody epitopes on the spike protein. Overall, the results of this study
provide detailed understanding of the spike glycan shield, which may be utilized for therapeutic efforts
against this crisis.

Introduction
Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-COV-2) has rapidly spread worldwide
since early 2020 and has been considered one of the most challenging global health crises within the
century. SARS-COV-2 has caused more than 20 million cases and more than 1 million deaths worldwide
as of September 2020.(1, 2) Drug and vaccine development are underway and multiple vaccines have
entered clinical trials and some of them are in the last stages of development.(3-5)
SARS-COV-2 is a lipid-enveloped single stranded RNA virus belonging to the beta-coronavirus
family, which also includes MERS, SARS and bat related coronaviruses.(6-9) A major characteristic of all
coronaviruses is the spike protein (S), which protrudes outward from the viral membrane and plays a key
role in the entry of the pathogen into the host cells by binding to human angiotensin converting enzyme-2
(h-ACE2).(6, 10-12) The structure of each monomer of the trimeric spike protein in SARS-COV-2 (Figure
1) can be divided into two subunits (S1 and S2), which can be cleaved at residues 685-686 (furin cleavage
site) by TMPRSS protease after binding to host cell receptor h-ACE2.(12) S1 subunit in S trimer includes a
N-terminal domain (NTD) and a receptor binding domain (RBD) that is responsible for binding to hACE2.(13) S2 subunit contains fusion peptides (FP), heptad repeats (HR1 and HR2), a transmembrane
(TM) and a cytoplasmic domain (CP). The homotrimeric spike protein is highly glycosylated with 22
predicted N-linked glycosylation and 4 O glycosylation sites per monomer, most of which are confirmed by
Cryo-EM studies.(14-17) Glycosylation of proteins plays a crucial role in numerous biological process such
as protein folding and evasion of immune response.(18)
The receptor binding domain (RBD) of SARS-COV-2 binds to its receptor h-ACE2 with a
significantly higher affinity than the earlier SARS coronavirus which is suggested to be the reason for its
higher infection rate than SARS-COV in 2002-2003.(19) A receptor binding motif (RBM) in RBD makes all
the contacts with the receptor by binding its concave surface to the convex exposed surface of h-ACE2.(20)
Details of interaction between RBD of SARS-COV-2 and h-ACE2 are studied by us and by other groups,
which showed that RBD of SARS-COV-2 binds to h-ACE2 with about 30 kcal/mol higher affinity than SARSCOV RBD. Mutations at critical residues from SARS to SARS-COV-2 RBM are suggested to the be the
reason for the higher affinity.(19, 21) Natural mutations at the RBM of SARS-COV-2 have been found in
multiple countries, which are not known to be linked with the severity of coronavirus.(22) In an earlier study,
we have shown that most of these mutations in RBM do not affect the binding affinity of SARS-COV-2 RBD
to h-ACE2 demonstrating the high tolerance of the interface for mutations. Our analysis showed the high
contribution of critical residues K417, Q493, Q498 and G502 of RBM in SARS-COV-2 for its high binding
affinity. In addition, our alanine scanning of interface residues in nCOV-2019 RBD showed that alanine
substitution at some residues such as G502, K417 and L455 can significantly decrease the binding affinity
of the complex.(19)
The spike protein in SARS-COV-2 is highly glycosylated with 22 N-linked glycosylation sites and 4
O-linked glycosylation sites.(14, 15) Glycosylation of the spike proteins plays a major role in evading the

humoral immune system by cloaking the S protein by a thick shield of glycans.(23, 24) For example, the
HIV-1 envelope glycoprotein (Env) features about 93 N-linked glycosylation sites with mostly high mannose
glycans (Man5-9), which covers most of the surface of the spike protein in HIV-1 and comprises over half
its mass.(25-27) N-linked glycosylation starts with synthesis of precursor oligosaccharides, which are
modified to high mannose forms by glucosidases and then trimmed to complex forms in the Golgi by
glucosyltransferases for signaling and other glycobiological functions.(28) A higher degree of processing is
usually indicative of exposure or accessibility of glycans to enzymes.(25) Dense crowding glycan regions
limit the activity of processing enzymes at these locations.

In this study, we report the microsecond long MD simulation of all-atom solvated fully glycosylated
spike protein embedded in a viral membrane model in both RBD-up or open state (PDB:6VSB)(10) and
RBD-down (PDB:6VXX)(13) or closed state. The structure of the two states for glycosylated S protein in
viral membrane were taken from the CHARMM-GUI website for this study.(14) Details of modeling different
regions were presented in detail by Im and coworkers.(14) Structural changes in the spike protein happens
on the order of microsecond timescale, where a scissoring motion is observed between the NTDs in the
RBD-up conformation. We have used network analysis and centrality measures in graph theory to pinpoint
the structural features of the glycan shield in the context of glycan-glycan interactions as well as binding of
antibodies to the spike protein. A modularity algorithm helped us to find glycan microdomains featuring high
glycan-glycan interactions with breaches between microdomains for antibodies to bind and neutralize the
virus.

Results:
Dynamical motions of the spike protein:
The root-mean-square deviation (RMSD) for each region of the spike protein in RBD-up and RBD-down
states are represented in Figure S1. The stalk region in both RBD-up and RBD-down states show a
fluctuating RMSD, which is due to bending motion in this region of spike protein. The tilting in the head of
spike is also observed in high resolution cryo-ET images as well as other recent MD studies of glycosylated
spike in viral membrane.(29, 30) The bending dynamics in the stalk region is suggested to assist the virus
in scanning the cell surface for receptor proteins more efficiently.(30) A snapshot of the open system at
1 Î¼s is represented in Figure 2A, which shows the incline between the head and the stalk domains of spike.
The three chains in the spike protein demonstrate various types of motions characterized by different RMSD

values (Figure S2). Glycan root-mean-square fluctuation (RMSF) were calculated for heavy atoms in each

glycan and then computing the mean and standard deviation for the glycan (Figure 2B for open and Figure
S3 for closed state). Consistently, in all chains, few of the NTD glycans such as N74 show high RMSF,
which is due to the high solvent exposure of this glycan in NTD compared to other regions. The glycans
near the RBD in chain A (RBD-up), such as N234 and T323 showed less fluctuation than other chains.
N234 and T323 are sandwiched between RBD and NTD of neighboring monomers in the trimeric spike
protein. Glycans in the stalk region showed high RMSF values demonstrating the effective shielding of the
spike in this region for both RBD-up and RBD-down states.

color coded with monomer A(up) in red, B in blue and C in purple B) RMSF of glycans in the open state of
spike for different chains A to C from top to bottom.
A principal component analysis (PCA) was performed on the head region (residues 1-1140) of both
RBD-up and RBD-down states to extract the fundamental motions of the trimeric protein. The first two PCs
are visualized in 2D plot (Figure 3A and B). Both RBD-down and -up states feature similar behaviors in
their PCA plot. In RBD up, PC-1 captures 56% of conformational motion whereas in RBD-down, PC-1
captures only 44% of all conformational motion. This shows the higher conformational change in RBD-up
state compared to RBD-down state. The first eigenvector was used to construct the porcupine plots to
visualize the most dominant motions in RBD up (Figure S4A) and RBD-down (Figure S4B) states. In the
RBD-up state, a scissoring motion is observed between the NTD of chain A and NTD of chain B. Based on
the PCA for RBD-up state, the total simulation time was separated into three clusters; cluster-1:0-200ns,
cluster-2: 200-600ns and cluster-3: 600-1000ns. The distribution of distance between center of mass of
NTD of different chains are calculated for the three different clusters and shown in Figure 3B. In the open
state, NTD of chain B goes toward the center of apex. The distribution of distance between the center of
apex and each NTD is shown in Figure S4C. In the RBD-down state, PC-1 shows the motion in RBD of
chain A toward the open conformation (Figure S4B). The simulation for RBD-down states was separated
into two clusters and distribution of the distance between center of mass of RBD and the apex center was

calculated for all the chains in both clusters. A clear separation is observed where RBD of chain A is more
distant from the apex center in the second cluster (Figure 3D).

Occupancy of spike protein by glycans:
Despite the highly dense glycan shield in the spike protein, there are breaches within the shield
that antibodies can bind and neutralize the virus.(31) A volume map of glycans in the spike protein in both
up and down conformations are shown in Figure 4, where isosurfaces were visualized for glycans from the
1 Î¼s MD simulation trajectory. The stalk region in the spike protein is highly shielded by the glycans and it

is unlikely for antibodies to bind to this region. The spike head on the other hand, shows glycan holes

providing opportunities for antibodies to bind. Importantly, NTD of all chains show epitopes free from
glycans. The RBM of chain A in the up conformation is completely free from glycans present the least
shielded domain of spike. Furthermore, there are regions on the RBD away from the RBM, that show
epitopes for antibodies and not shielded by glycans. We have computed the solvent accessible surface

area (SASA) of different regions of the spike for antibodies with a probe radius of 7.2 Ã that represents the

hypervariable domains of antibodies.(31) RBM of chain A in up conformation shows the highest SASA in
all chains followed by RBM of chains B and C. On the other hand, RBD of chain A shows the lowest SASA
among the three monomers. NTD of all chains show high SASA in all chains. In the closed state, RBM and
NTD of chain A shows higher SASA than other chains which is due its conformational change toward the
open state. In summary, epitopes on RBM, RBD and NTD of spike protein show high SASA for antibodies
to bind and neutralize the spike.

Glycan-Glycan interaction and network analysis of glycans:
A network analysis was carried out on the glycan shield of the spike protein in both RBD-up and
RBD-down states to find the glycans that are most important for an effective shield. This approach has
recently been applied to the glycan shield of HIV-1 spike protein.(32, 33) In the glycan network, each glycan
represents a node in the graph and two nodes are connected by an edge if the glycans have a distance
less than 50 Ã in the starting structure. Edges are weighted by the normalized absolute value of non-bonded
interaction energy (vdw+electrostatic) between each pair of glycans. A network was built for the whole

simulation time in both RBD-up and -down states. All network analysis was performed in networkx and
graph visualizations were done using Gephi.(34, 35) The adjacency matrix for these two networks are
calculated (Figure S5). Two centrality measurements in graph theory were utilized to analyze the network
of glycans. Betweenness centrality quantifies the number of times a node acts as a bridge along the shortest
path connecting every two nodes in the graph and is an important indicator of the influence of the node
within the network. Eigenvector centrality measures the nodeâs importance in the network by considering
the importance of the neighbors of that node. If the node is connected to many other nodes that are
themselves well connected, that node is assigned a high eigenvector centrality score (Figure 5).

Figure 5. Centrality measurements (eigenvector and betweenness) for A) RBD-up and B) RBD-down
states.
Glycans in the stalk region show high eigenvector centrality in both RBD-up and -down states. This
means that glycan-glycan interactions in the stalk region is strong and glycans in this region are well
connected which result in effective shielding of the stalk against antibodies. In contrast, connections in the
spike head and specially at the apex are sparser as the eigenvector centralities are small for this region.
Two apex glycans (N234A and N165B) near RBD of chain A (up) in the open state, show a high
betweenness centrality (BC). These two glycans show a low BC in the closed state. Glycan N616B in RBDup and N603B in RBD-down show highest BC in their corresponding network which shows the great impact
of this glycan in the proper shielding of the spike protein. Glycans N603 and N616 connect lower head with
upper head glycans and are highly central in the network.

Glycans in head region are well separated from glycans that shield the stalk of spike protein.
Consequently, we performed network analysis of glycans in the head region of spike protein for the total
simulation time. Centrality measurements for open and closed conformations of spike head are shown in
Figures S6A and B. A modularity maximization algorithm(36) is used, which resulted in identifying 5 different
glycan microdomains for RBD-up (Figure 6A) and 4 glycan microdomains in RBD-down states (Figure 6B).

Microdomains feature a high glycan-glycan interaction among them and lower number of edges between
different microdomains.(32) The higher number of microdomains in RBD-up state shows that the spike
protein is more vulnerable when RBD is in up conformation. Glycans in the lower head all belong to the
same microdomain (Cyan-I) in both RBD-up and RBD-down states. This demonstrates the effective
shielding of the lower head by glycans regardless of the RBD conformation as all these glycans belong to
the same microdomain. Glycan microdomains in RBD-up and -down conformations were mapped onto the
spike head to visualize these clusters on the protein (figure 6). Overall connectivity is lower near the RBD
as this region is divided into three different microdomains in RBD-down and four microdomains in RBD-up
state. In RBD-down state, most glycans have similar BC and only one glycan N603B shows a relatively
higher BC in the network. This is a high mannose glycan, which connects the upper head with the lower
head region in the glycan network and is crucial for effective shielding. In both RBD-up and -down states,
glycans at the lower head also showed high eigenvector centrality, indicating the effective shield of this
region. When RBD is in up conformation, glycans near RBD of chain A (up) can interact with glycans from
NTD of chain B. As a result, when RBD is open, glycans N234A, T323A, N331A and N343A all belong to
the microdomain that comprises glycans of chain B (shown as Green). This leads to encompassing the
RBD of chain (A) in RBD-up state by the same microdomain (Green-III), which enhances the shielding of
RBD region away from the RBM. This is also demonstrated by the lower SASA of the region of RBD of
chain A away from the binding interface with ACE2 (Figure 4B). However, in RBD-down state, the
mentioned glycans of chain A are distant from glycans of chain B and therefore they belong to the
microdomain that includes other glycans from chain A (shown as Orange-II). Furthermore, glycans N234A
and N165B show high BC in RBD-up state, which is due to their interaction with other glycans from the
space left open from RBD of chain A. Glycan N616, which is a fucosylated complex glycan, also shows a
high BC in RBD-up state. Interestingly, most of the glycans in the lower head region are oligomannose,
whereas the glycans at the upper head region (apex) are mostly complex glycans. Complex glycans have
a higher degree of processing by glycan processing enzymes. This correlates with the higher number of
microdomains in upper head region where connections between glycans are sparser than the lower head
region. Glycan sparsity was shown before to correlate with the degree of processing.
To identify if the interactions between glycans is coupled with protein conformational changes, we
performed the network analysis on the clusters of simulation found from PCA. In the RBD-up state, separate
networks were built for 0-200, 200-600 and 600-1000 ns of simulation. Similarly, in RBD-down state
networks were built for the first half (0-500 ns) and second half (500-1000 ns) of simulation. BCs were
calculated for all the aforementioned networks and changes in betweenness centrality ÎBC were measured

between these networks (Figure S6C and D). For the open state simulation, the scissoring motion in NTD

is coupled with increasing the BC of N234A, N603A and N165B. As the NTD of chains A and B come closer
together glycans in these two chains make stronger connections especially near RBD of chain A where due
to the open state, glycan N234A, which is inserted in the space left open by RBD in open conformation,

can freely interact with glycans of chain B. N603 is a high mannose glycan in the middle regions of spike

and the NTD scissoring motion grants a higher BC for this glycan in RBD-up state. In the RBD-down state,
the motion in RBD of chain A to the up conformation increases the BC of glycans such as T323A and
N657A and does not affect the BC of most other glycans. Glycan T323A is located at the tail of RBD and
N657A is in close proximity of RBD of chain A in the middle head region. The conformational change in
RBD brings these glycans closer resulting in a more compact network of glycans in the middle head region
and higher BC of these glycans and other neighboring glycans in chain A (Figure S6D).
Antibody overlap analysis:
Neutralizing antibodies look for breaches in the glycan shield, where the glycan densities are
sparse.(25, 32) Within a microdomain, glycans are highly connected by a high number of edges in the
network and most antibodies bind the regions between these microdomains as comparatively sparse edges
connect different microdomains.(25) Therefore, these microdomains help identify susceptible regions of
spike protein for immunological studies. Antibodies for spike protein were divided into three categories:
RBM-binder, RBD-binder (region of RBD away from RBM) and NTD-binder. The antibodies chosen for each
category are presented in the methods section. To investigate the relation between binding of antibodies
to known epitopes of the spike protein and the identified glycan microdomains, we utilized an antibody
overlap analysis.(25) Antibodies were first overlaid with the spike protein by fitting to their corresponding
region in the spike protein. Next, we calculated the average number of clashes between each overlaid
antibody and the glycan heavy atoms in each microdomain with a cutoff distance of 5 Ã during 1 Î¼s

simulation. Results of this analysis are shown in Figure 7A for RBD-up and 7B for RBD-down states.

Lower left RBD binder antibody (pink) with open state of spike and lower right RBM binder antibody (blue)

The RBM-binder antibody had the lowest number of clashes among all antibodies with
microdomains. RBD-binder antibody of chain A had the highest number of clashes among all chains with
glycans in microdomain III(G). RBD-binder antibodies of chains B and C have lower number of clashes with
glycan microdomains than chain A, where RBD is in the up state. Antibody binding to NTD of chain C (NTDC) in open state shows a high number of clashes with microdomain IV(P). Similarly, in the closed state,
NTD-binder antibody in chain C (NTD-C) also shows a high number of clashes with cluster IV(P). NTD of
chain C also showed a lower SASA than NTD of other chains. In the open state, microdomain III(G)
comprises the high BC glycans N234A, N165B and T323B. The high BC of glycans in this microdomain
correlates with its high number of clashes with antibodies of RBD-A and NTD-A. In RBD-down state, RBDbinder antibodies seem to have similar number of clashes with different glycan microdomains. To identify
glycans that have most effect on antibody binding, we also quantified the number of clashes of antibodies
with each glycan in different chains and averaged over the simulation time of 1Î¼s (Figure S7). RBM antibody

has only a low number of clashes with N165A glycan. In open state, RBD-A antibody has a high number of
clashes with multiple glycans (N122B, N149B, N331A and N343A). RBD antibodies bound to the other

chains (RBD-B and RBD-C) show lower number of clashes with glycans N122 and N165. NTD antibody of
chain C (NTD-C) in both open and closed states show a high number of clashes with glycans N74C and
N149C.
Discussion:
Understanding the structure and dynamics of glycan shield in the spike protein of SARS-COV-2 is
an indispensable requirement for any antibody and vaccine design endeavors.(23, 37, 38) To this end, we
have performed MD simulations of fully glycosylated spike protein of SARS-COV-2 in both open and closed
states. Analysis of dynamics for 1 Î¼s trajectories showed a tilting motion in the stalk region, which was also

demonstrated with experimental cryo-ET images(29, 30) and suggested to aid the virus with screening the

host cells for receptor proteins (Figure 2A). Glycan motions were characterized by RMSF (Figures 2B and

S3), which showed higher values for stalk glycans demonstrating the high shielding potential of this normally
solvent-exposed region. PCA of the head region of open state of spike demonstrated a scissoring motion
between NTDs of neighboring monomers A(up) and B. This scissoring motion resulted in trimer asymmetry
with NTD of monomer B advancing toward the center of the apex region and NTD of monomer A showing
an angular motion centering on the apex center and toward NTD of monomer B. Based on the PCA, the
simulation was divided into three different clusters with distribution of distances between the center of
masses of NTDs of different monomers showing different asymmetrical trimers in each cluster (Figures 3B
and S4A,C). A scissoring motion in the trimeric spike of HIV-1 on the sub-microsecond timescale was

observed by Leminn et. al,(32) which was suggested to be essential for receptor binding. The NTD
scissoring motion is only observed in the open state and this could suggest, the scissoring motion is a
means employed by the virus to camouflage parts of the spike protein (such as regions of RBD excluding
the RBM) when RBD is in the up conformation. The first PC for RBD-down state was visualized (Figure
S4C) and shows the conformational change of RBD in chain A from down toward up conformation.

(Figure 3D) exhibited this motion for two clusters of data 0-500ns and 500-1000 ns separated based on the
PCA of open state simulation.
The abundance of information in MD simulations of glycosylated spike protein may hinder
identifying important biological features of the glycan shield. Therefore, a network analysis approach is
used to identify collective behavior of glycans. The most central region of spike based on eigenvector
centrality of the network, is shown to be the stalk domain and the lower head region of spike where a dense
array of glycans gives rise to resilience to enzymatic actions. Most of the glycans at the lower head region
and upper stalk domain are high mannose with the lower degree of processing which correlates with their
high centralities in the graph. High eigenvector centrality of lower head and the stalk glycans also makes it
hard for neutralizing enzymes to target and to date, no epitopes for antibodies have been found that target
this region.(17, 23, 39)
Glycans on the head region demonstrated different behaviors depending on the RBD state (up or
down conformation). Interestingly two glycan at the open state, N234A and N165B show a high BC. N234A
occupies the volume left open by the RBD in the open state, whereas in the closed state it is directed toward
the solvent. The highly conserved glycan N165B is inserted between RBD of chain A(up) and NTD of chain
B and in the open state it occupies the volume of left vacant by RBD (A) in the up conformation. Amaro and
coworkers(31) studied the fully glycosylated spike protein of SARS-COV-2 computationally and showed
that N234A and N165B are crucial for stabilizing the RBD in the up conformation in the open state of spike.
Their simulation showed that mutating N234 and N165 to Ala destabilized the RBD in the open state.
Furthermore, experimental negative stain electron microscopy and single particle cryo-EM showed that the
equilibrium population ratio between the open and closed state is 1:1.(40) Deletion of N234 glycan shifts
this ratio to 1:4 favoring the closed state and deletion of glycan at N165 increased the population of open
state with a ratio of 2:1. It was shown that N234 glycan stabilizes the open state of the RBD and inhibits the
up-to-down conformational change and N165 glycan sterically inhibits the down-to-up conformational
change of RBD. Here we have shown that these two glycans in the open state exhibit a high BC, which is
due to their interaction with each other as well as other neighboring glycans at RBD of chain A as well as
NTD of chain B. We have further demonstrated that the BC of glycans in the head region is coupled with
the scissoring motion between NTDs of monomers A and B. In addition, the scissoring motion gives rise to
high BC for glycans in the middle region of spike for glycans N616A and N616B. This is caused by the

tighter packing of glycans in the asymmetric trimer. In the closed state, the BC of most glycans do not
change, which correlates with lower fluctuation of RBD-down simulation.
Modularity maximization in network analysis allowed us to find 5 microdomains of glycans in RBDup and 4 microdomains in RBD-down states. The higher number of microdomains at the apex of RBD-up
state shows the more vulnerability of spike protein to antibodies in the open state. Glycans at the lower
head in both open and closed states belong to the same microdomain (Cyan-I), which shows large number
of edges between glycans in this region and thereby effective shielding. Apex glycans are divided into three
microdomains in closed and four microdomains in open state. The antibody overlap analysis showed that
RBM binder antibody in open state (up) shows the lowest number of clashes with glycan microdomains
(Figure 7A). The RBM of chain A also showed the highest SASA among other epitopes on spike protein
which shows its great potential for antibody design strategies. NTD-binder antibodies can also bind to
epitopes on the NTD of spike protein. These antibodies showed high number of clashes with glycans N74
and N149 of the respective monomer that they bind. The glycans on the surface of spike protein exert a
collective behavior, which is an important property that needs to be considered in the context of vaccine
and antibody design.
Methods:
Molecular dynamics simulation: Structures for glycosylated spike protein in the viral membrane with
RBD-up and RBD-down states were taken from the CHARMM-GUI website (http://www.charmmgui.org/docs/archive/covid-19).(14) Details of modeling the missing regions in the spike protein are
presented by Im et. al. (14) CHARMM36 forcefield(41-43) was used for protein, lipids and carbohydrates in
this study. The glycan composition for each site in the spike protein represents the most abundant based
on experimental mass spectroscopy data. The selected glycan sequences include 22 N-linked and 1 Olinked for each monomer of trimeric spike and the composition at each site is shown in Table S2.(15, 16)
GROMACS(44) software was used for molecular dynamics (MD) simulation. Energy minimization was
performed in 5000 steps using the steepest descent algorithm. A LINCS algorithm in all steps constrained
the bonds containing hydrogen atoms. Equilibration was performed with a standard 6-step equilibration
scripts from CHARMM-GUI with restraints on protein, lipid and glycan atoms.(45) For the first three steps
of equilibration, each step included 125 ps using Berendsen thermostat at temperature 310.15 K and a
coupling constant of 1 ps.(46) In the last 4 equilibration steps a Berendsen barostat(47) was used to
maintain the pressure at 1 bar. For the production step, all restraints were removed, and the system was
simulated under a NPT ensemble using the Parrinello-Rahman barostat(48) with a compressibility of
4.5 Ã 10â5 bar â1 and a coupling constant of 5 ps. The temperature was maintained at 310 K using a NosÃ©Hoover thermostat with a temperature coupling constant of 1 ps.(49) The production run lasted 1Î¼s for each
system (RBD-up and RBD-down) with a 2 fs timestep and the particle-mesh Ewald (PME)(50) for long

range electrostatic interactions using GROMACS 2018.3 package.(44)

Solvent accessible surface area (SASA): SASA was calculated using VMD(51) with a probe radius of
7.2 Ã which represents the hypervariable region of antibodies.(31) Multiple regions were chosen for SASA

calculation: RBM (residues 440 to 508). RBD (residues of RBD away from RBM 330-440 and 509-520) and
NTD (residues 13 to 310)

Glycan-antibody overlap analysis: Antibodies that bind and neutralize spike protein are divided into three
categories(39): antibodies that bind to the exposed part of RBD (RBM-binder), antibodies that bind to
epitopes away from the RBM in RBD or RBD-binder and antibodies that bind to epitopes on NTD (NTDbinder). Three different antibodies were used in this study: B38 for RBM binder (PDB:7BZ5)(52), S309 for
RBD binder (PDB:6WPT for open and PDB:6WPS for closed state)(53) and 4A8 antibody as NTD-binder
(PDB:7C2L)(54).
