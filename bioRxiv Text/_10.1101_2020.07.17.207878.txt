Abstract
Observational studies of the ongoing coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) outbreak suggest that
a cytokine storm is involved in the pathogenesis of severe illness. However, the molecular
mechanisms underlying the altered pathological inflammation in COVID-19 are largely unknown.
We report here that toll-like receptor (TLR) 4-mediated inflammatory signaling molecules are
upregulated in peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) from COVID-19 patients, compared
with healthy controls. Among the most highly increased inflammatory mediators in
severe/critically ill patients, S100A9, an alarmin and TLR4 ligand, was found as a noteworthy
biomarker, because it inversely correlated with the serum albumin levels. These data support a link
between TLR4 signaling and pathological inflammation during COVID-19 and contribute to
develop therapeutic approaches through targeting TLR4-mediated inflammation.
Introduction
The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is caused by the novel coronavirus SARS-CoV2 and has spread globally causing international concerns (1-3). As of July 16, 2020, there were
13,378,853 confirmed cases of COVID-19 in 216 countries, with 580,045 confirmed deaths (4).
Most patients are asymptomatic or recover after mounting a self-limiting antiviral response with
the development of neutralizing anti-viral antibodies and cell-mediated immunity (5). However,
~10% of all cases become serious, with dyspnoea, lymphopenia, and extensive chest x-ray
abnormalities and half of these become critically ill, with respiratory and multi-organ failure (68). There appears to be a relationship between the clinical and immunological features of COVID19, as the disease severity correlates with certain immunological markers (7, 9). Recent studies
have shown that severe/critically ill (SEVERE) patients exhibit “cytokine storm”, which is related
to the production of excessive cytokines, dysregulated immune cell function, and massive systemic

inflammation (1, 5, 10). Understanding the causes of altered immune features of COVID-19 would
enable the refinement of preventive vaccine targets and accelerate therapeutic development.
Despite this, the molecular mechanisms underlying exaggerated inflammatory phenotypes during
COVID-19 are largely unknown. We herein show that toll-like receptor (TLR) 4-mediated
inflammatory signaling molecules, which mimic pathogenesis of bacterial sepsis, are upregulated
in peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) from COVID-19 patients.
Results and discussion
Characterization of immune features of COVID-19 patients in terms of clinical severity
To investigate the immune signaling signature of COVID-19, a total of 48 Korean subjects
[untreated COVID-19 patients with various clinical severities (n = 28) and healthy controls (n =
20)] were enrolled in the study. Table 1 summarizes the characteristics and laboratory findings of
20 mild/moderate [MILD; median age 53.5 (range 21–97) years] and eight SEVERE [63.5 (range
36–78) years] patients. This study was approved by Institutional Research and Ethics Committee
at Chungnam National University Hospital (CNUH 2020-03-056; Daejeon, Korea) and was
conducted in accordance with the Declaration of Helsinki (11). In the SEVERE group, seven of
eight (87.5%) patients had fever at the time of sampling versus only two (10%) in the MILD group.
The median time from symptom onset to mechanical ventilation was 10 (range 8–12) days.
Underlying comorbidities were present in about half of the patients (hypertension, diabetes
mellitus, dementia, schizophrenia, and chronic kidney disease) and did not differ between the
groups. The median time from symptom onset to sampling was 5.5 (range 5–10) and 5.7 (range 5–
11) days in the MILD and SEVERE groups, respectively. The scores for the degree of illness were
higher in the SEVERE group at the time of sampling. The Charlson comorbidity index was similar
in the two groups, because age was matched and the underlying conditions did not differ

significantly. All MILD patients recovered fully without sequelae, while four SEVERE patients
required extracorporeal membrane oxygenation. One patient died of persistent pneumonia and
septic shock. Among the laboratory parameters, hypoalbuminemia, a high neutrophil-tolymphocyte ratio, and increased serum C-reactive protein and lactate dehydrogenase levels were
associated with disease severity (Table 1).
In this study, we first assessed the profiles of immunological determinants depending on
disease severity in Korean COVID-19. To examine the immune-related transcriptome profiles
induced by COVID-19 infection, we performed nCounter Human Immunology gene expression
assays for PBMCs from eight SEVERE and 20 MILD patients and 20 healthy controls (HC) (Fig.
1A). Using principal component analysis (PCA), we found that HC was clearly separated from
both SEVERE and MILD, while the two patient groups intermingled (Fig. 1B). These data imply
that altered expression of immune-related genes is a transcriptional hallmark of COVID-19 and
that the overall immune transcriptome profiles are similar in SEVERE and MILD groups in Korea.
To determine which genes are differentially expressed in COVID-19 patients, we compared the
expression of immune-related genes between HC and COVID-19 patients. In all, 298 differentially
expressed immune genes (DEiG) were identified, and they are mainly involved in cytokine–
cytokine receptor interaction and nuclear factor (NF)-κB signaling pathways (Fig. 1C, D). The
same analysis was repeated for each patient group separately, and we identified 230 and 255 DEiGs
in the SEVERE and MILD samples, respectively (Fig. 1A, C). The cytokine–cytokine receptor
interaction was the top enriched pathway in both the SEVERE and MILD groups (Fig. S1B, D).
We then investigated the full list of gene families associated with the cytokine–cytokine
receptor interaction pathway. Using the HUGO gene nomenclature database, members of several
gene families were identified, including chemokines, interleukin (IL), tumor necrosis factor (TNF),

and interferon (Fig. S2A). Notably, C-C motif (CC) chemokines [CC chemokine ligand (CCL) 2,
CCL7, CCL8, CCL24, CCL20, CCL13, and CCL3], C-X-C motif (CXC) chemokines [CXC
chemokine ligand (CXCL) 2 and CXCL10], and chemokine receptor subfamilies, were most
numerous, and were significantly (FDR < 0.05) upregulated in both MILD and SEVERE COVID19 patient groups (Fig. 1E, F; Fig. S2B). These data partially correlated with recent reports that
severe and critically ill cases are associated with defective immune responses, i.e. lymphopenia,
high neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio, and increased inflammatory cytokine and chemokine levels
(1, 5, 12-17). However, our results are unique in that we found that many CC chemokines and ILs
are highly upregulated in both MILD and SEVERE patients, compared with HC. Together, these
data suggest that abnormal inflammatory chemokine generation represents common immune
features during COVID-19.

Elucidation of molecular signaling pathways of immune transcriptome during COVID-19
TLR signaling pathways are mediated by the components, including sensors that recognize
certain pathogen- and damage-associated molecular patterns (PAMPs and DAMPs) and the
adaptors that transduce signals (18). Among TLRs, TLR4 can recognize lipopolysaccharide (LPS),
other PAMPs, and DAMPs, at the cell surface, whereas TLR3, TLR7, TLR8, and TLR9 are
exclusively expressed in endosomal compartments and recognize viral components (18-20). TLR4
is the only TLR to transduce innate immune signals through both myeloid differentiation primaryresponse 88 (MyD88) and Toll-IL-1 receptor-domain-containing adaptor-inducing IFN-β (TRIF)
to activate NF-κB and interferon regulatory factor (IRF) signaling, respectively (18-20).

Next, we explored the second top hit pathway, NF-κB signaling (Fig. 1D), which is one of
the major hyper-activated pathways following COVID-19 infection (21). With some exceptions
(such as LCK, CD40LG, PLAU, PTGS2, and TRAF5), the expression of TLR4 and its
related/downstream signaling molecules (CD14, MYD88, IRAK1, TRAF6, TIRAP, TICAM) were
significantly (FDR < 0.05) upregulated (Fig. 2A). In addition, most NF-κB signaling pathway
genes (NFKBIA, NFKB1, RELA, NFKB2) were significantly (FDR < 0.05) upregulated (Fig. 2A).
These data suggest that TLR4-mediated NF-κB signaling pathway activation is involved in the
upregulation of inflammatory responses in patients with COVID-19 infection. Interestingly, there
were no significant differences in the expression of IRF3, TLR3, TLR7, TLR8, and TLR9, all of
which are related to putative viral signaling (22, 23), between COVID-19 patients and HC (Fig.
2B). These data strongly suggest that, TLR4-triggered inflammatory signaling, rather than viral
stimulation, contribute to molecular pathogenesis during COVID-19. We also found that IL-1β and
its downstream inflammatory signaling molecules (IL1R1, MYD88, IRAK1, TRAF6, NFKBIA,
NFKB1, RELA) were dramatically elevated in COVID-19 patients (Fig. 2A). NF-κB signaling
pathway is required for proinflammatory cytokine/chemokine generation and the production of
antimicrobial proteins (20, 24); IL-1 family members are involved in the initiation of potent
inflammatory responses, orchestration of innate and adaptive immunity, and development of sepsis
(25, 26). Although both TLR and IL-1 signaling activation is critical for innate immune defense
against a variety of pathogens, dysregulation of this signaling pathway can lead to pathogenesis of
various diseases including inflammatory and autoimmune diseases (25-28). The data suggest that
the upregulated profiles of TLR4, IL1R, and NF-κB signaling pathway molecules in COVID-19
patients are presumably associated with the altered immune responses to viral components, host

DAMP signals, or cytokine signaling activation (10), and may contribute to uncontrolled
pathological inflammation.

Identification of SEVERE-specific immune target genes
To understand the pathophysiological differences between SEVERE and MILD patients
better, we then examined whether there are any transcriptomic differences between the two
COVID-19 patient groups. Directly comparing the gene expression profiles between the SEVERE
and MILD groups, no genes were significantly (FDR < 0.05) differentially expressed, which might
have been partly hindered by the heterogeneity of the presentation of disease severity. Therefore,
we performed two pairwise transcriptome comparisons: SEVERE versus HC and MILD versus
HC. From these comparisons, 58 DEiGs were identified showing significant (FDR < 0.05) changes
in gene expression between SEVERE and HC, which are potential therapeutic targets, but none
between MILD and HC (Fig. 3A). Intriguingly, the highly expressed SEVERE-specific
upregulated genes were mainly associated with complement activation (C9 and C1QA),
autoimmunity (AIRE and PRKCD), and inflammatory processes (CXCL11, CCL16, and S100A9)
(Fig. 3B). The SEVERE-specific downregulated genes were linked to major histocompatibility
complex proteins (HLA-DRA and HLA-DMA), T-cell factor/lymphoid enhancer-binding factor
family (TCF-7 and LEF1), and natural killer cell functions (KLRB1, KLRG1, CD160, and GZMK)
(Fig. 3C).
We then evaluated the correlation between the immune mediators and clinical parameters (Fig.
S3) and among the immune markers (Fig. S4) in COVID-19 patients. On examining the
relationship between immune markers and clinical parameters (Fig. S3), we identified S100A9 as

an important biomarker that was inversely correlated with serum albumin in the SEVERE group
(Fig. 3D). The increased S100A9 seems to be critically important because hypoalbuminemia is
associated with disease severity in COVID-19 patients (7). S100A8/A9 (a heterodimer complex
of S100A8 and S100A9 proteins) (29) is a DAMP signal as a TLR4 ligand (30). The elevated
expression of S100A8/A9 is induced by inflammation, and secreted S100A8/A9 further amplifies
inflammatory soluble cytokines/chemokines, forming a feed-forward loop affecting the persistent
inflammation (31). Importantly, S100A8/A9, as a ‘soil signal’, mediates metastasis of melanoma
or breast cancers to the lung (30). Since S100A8/A9 protein is involved in the pathogenesis of
numerous inflammation-associated and autoimmune diseases (30, 32), our findings provide new
insight into the pathogenesis of COVID-19, and may contribute to therapeutic approaches based
on the S100A9-CC chemokine-mediated inflammatory signaling. Recent promising results
suggest that dexamethasone has beneficial effects to reduce deaths of patients receiving invasive
ventilation or oxygen (33). Our findings provide a rationale to use dexamethasone, a ligand for
glucocorticoid receptor, which interferes with TLR-dependent inflammatory signaling through
multiple mechanisms (34, 35). Collectively, these data will contribute to better management and
the development of targeted approaches for COVID-19 patients by enhancing our knowledge on
molecular pathogenesis of the disease.

Materials and Methods
Study population
COVID-19 patients were confirmed by real-time quantitative polymerase chain reaction (RTqPCR) for SARS-CoV-2 in nasopharyngeal and oropharyngeal swab, with or without sputum.
Patients were categorized into two groups; mild/moderate versus severe/critical cases. In severity
assessment, the World Health Organization’s COVID-19 disease severity definition was used (36).
Twenty-eight COVID-19 patients (8 SEVERE versus 20 MILD) admitted to Chungnam National
University Hospital, and age/sex-matched 20 healthy controls, giving specific informed consent
were included in the study. We excluded patients with age under 19. In the severe/critical group,
two patients were transferred from a long term care facility in which had a COVID-19 outbreak.
They had been hospitalized with well-controlled schizophrenia. Another patient was referred to
our hospital in a state of endotracheal intubation. The patients’ characteristics, clinical symptoms
and laboratory test results are summarized in Table 1. All clinical and laboratory parameters were
those at the time of sampling. The sampling point (median 5-6 days after illness onset) was
determined by previous reports about COVID-19 patients (3, 17), which is relatively early in the
clinical courses. In asymptomatic patients, a screened date for COVID-19 because of strong
epidemiologic link was used for illness onset.

Ethics statement
This study was approved by the Institutional Research and Ethics Committee at Chungnam
National University Hospital (CNUH 2020-03-056; Daejeon, Korea) and conducted in accordance
with the Declaration of Helsinki.

Nanostring nCounter assay
Nanostring nCounter Human Immunology gene expression assays and Human miRNA expression
assays were performed at PhileKorea Technology (Daejeon, South Korea), using the NanoString
nCounter GX Human Immunology Kit V2 (NanoString Technologies, Inc., Seattle, WA, USA).
Normalization of gene expression levels was performed by scaling with the geometric mean of the
built-in control gene probes for each sample. Differentially expressed immune genes (DEiGs)
among HC, SEVERE and MILD patients, were satisfied false discovery rate (FDR) < 0.05 which
is analyzed and corrected by wilcox.test and p.adjust functions, respectively, implemented in stat
package of R (v. 3.6.2).

Cell Culture and RNA extraction
Human PBMCs from healthy volunteers were isolated from heparinized venous blood using
Ficoll-Hypaque (Lymphoprep; Alere technologies, Oslo, Norway) as described previously (37).
Total RNA from PBMCs was extracted using QIAzol lysis reagent (Qiagen, Hilden, Germany)
and miRNeasy Mini Kits (Qiagen) according to the manufacturer’s instructions, followed by RNA
quantitation.

Bioinformatics analysis
The Spearman’s correlation coefficients of gene expressions levels of 579 immune genes were
calculated with a cor.test function implemented in stat package of R. The KEGG pathway
enrichment analysis was performed using DAVID (version 6.8, https://david.ncifcrf.gov) with a
human reference gene set. We picked out significantly enriched pathways with FDR < 0.05.

To identify chemokine, interleukin, TNF, interferon and those receptor gene families, we
downloaded gene family annotations

from HUGO Gene Nomenclature Committee

(https://www.genenames.org) (38).

Statistical analysis
Statistical analyses were performed with Analyse-it, version 5.1 (Analyse-it Software, Ltd., Leeds,
UK), SPSS Statistics for Windows, version 24.0 (SPSS Inc., Chicago, IL, USA), and GraphPad
Prism, version 5.0 (GraphPad Software, San Diego, CA, USA). The data were processed by
principal component analysis, Spearman’s correlation, Student’s t-test, Mann-Whitney U test,
ANOVA, and Kruskal-Wallis H test, as appropriate, and detailed in each figure and figure legends.
Results are presented as medians (ranges) or means ± S.E.M. (standard error of the mean) or ±
S.D. (standard deviation) as indicated in figure legends. P < 0.05 was considered significant and
marked as *P < 0.05, **P < 0.01, ***P < 0.001, ****P < 0.0001.
