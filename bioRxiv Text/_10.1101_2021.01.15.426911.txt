37

To date severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) has infected over

38

100 million individuals resulting in over two million deaths. Many vaccines are being

39

deployed to prevent coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) including two novel mRNA-

40

based vaccines1,2. These vaccines elicit neutralizing antibodies and appear to be safe and

41

effective, but the precise nature of the elicited antibodies is not known3-6. Here we report on

42

the antibody and memory B cell responses in a cohort of 20 volunteers who received either

43

the Moderna (mRNA-1273) or Pfizer-BioNTech (BNT162b2) vaccines. Consistent with

44

prior reports, 8 weeks after the second vaccine injection volunteers showed high levels of

45

IgM, and IgG anti-SARS-CoV-2 spike protein (S) and receptor binding domain (RBD)

46

binding titers3,5,6. Moreover, the plasma neutralizing activity, and the relative numbers of

47

RBD-specific memory B cells were equivalent to individuals who recovered from natural

48

infection7,8. However, activity against SARS-CoV-2 variants encoding E484K or N501Y or

49

the K417N:E484K:N501Y combination was reduced by a small but significant margin.

50

Consistent with these findings, vaccine-elicited monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) potently

51

neutralize SARS-CoV-2, targeting a number of different RBD epitopes in common with

52

mAbs isolated from infected donors. Structural analyses of mAbs complexed with S trimer

53

suggest that vaccine- and virus-encoded S adopts similar conformations to induce

54

equivalent anti-RBD antibodies. However, neutralization by 14 of the 17 most potent mAbs

55

tested was reduced or abolished by either K417N, or E484K, or N501Y mutations. Notably,

56

the same mutations were selected when recombinant vesicular stomatitis virus

57

(rVSV)/SARS-CoV-2 S was cultured in the presence of the vaccine elicited mAbs. Taken

58

together the results suggest that the monoclonal antibodies in clinical use should be tested

against newly arising variants, and that mRNA vaccines may need to be updated

periodically to avoid potential loss of clinical efficacy.

61

Between 19 October 2020 and 15 January 2021, 20 volunteers who received two doses of the

62

Moderna (n=14) or Pfizer-BioNTech mRNA (n=6) vaccines were recruited for blood donation

63

and analyzed. Ages of the analyzed volunteers ranged from 29-69 years (median 43); 12

64

(60%) were male and 8 (40%) female. 16 participants identified as Caucasian, 2 as Hispanic, and

65

1 as African American or Asian, respectively. The time from the second vaccination to sample

66

collection varied between 3-14 weeks with an average of 8 weeks. None of the volunteers had a

67

history of prior SARS-CoV-2 infection and none experienced serious adverse events after

68

vaccination (Extended Data Table 1).

69
70

Vaccine plasma binding and neutralizing activity against SARS-CoV-2

71

Plasma IgM, IgG and IgA responses to SARS-CoV-2 S and RBD were measured by enzyme-

72

linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA)7,8. All individuals tested showed reactivity to S and RBD

73

that was significantly higher compared to pre-COVID-19 historic controls (Extended Data Fig

74

1a-f). As might be expected anti-S and -RBD IgG levels were higher than IgM or IgA.

75

Moreover, there was a strong positive correlation between anti-RBD and anti-S response in all

76

three immunoglobulin isotypes measured (Extended Data Fig 1g-i). In line with previous

77

reports3,6,9, IgG and IgM levels were significantly higher in the vaccinated group compared to a

78

cohort of convalescent patients assayed 1.3 and 6.2 months after infection, while IgA levels were

79

similar (Extended Data Fig 1j-l).

80
81

Plasma neutralizing activity was determined using human immunodeficiency virus-1 (HIV-1)

82

pseudotyped with SARS-CoV-2 S protein7,8,10. In agreement with previous reports3,6,9, there was

83

a broad range of plasma neutralizing activity 3-14 weeks after the second vaccine dose that was

84

similar to that elicited by natural infection in a convalescent cohort after 1.3 months, and greater

85

than the activity at 6.2 months after infection (Fig. 1a, Extended Data Table 1). There was no

86

significant difference in neutralizing activity between the Moderna and Pfizer-BioNTech

87

vaccines (Fig. 1b). Whereas convalescent antibody titers tend to correlate with severity and

88

length of time of infection, additional sampling would be required to understand the correlates of

89

the magnitude of the vaccine responses. As expected, plasma neutralizing activity was directly

90

correlated to anti-S and -RBD binding titers in ELISAs7,8 (Fig. 1c, d, and Extended Data Fig. 2a-

91

d). Finally, RBD and S binding, and neutralizing activities were directly correlated to the time

92

between the first vaccine dose and blood donation with significantly reduced levels in all 3

93

measurements with time (Fig. 1e, f and g, and Extended Data Fig. 2e-h)11. However, this and

94

other small studies3,11 cannot accurately predict the half-life of the neutralizing response. Larger

95

numbers of individuals in diverse cohorts will need to be studied to determine the precise half-

96

life of the vaccine elicited neutralizing response.

97
98

To determine whether plasma from vaccinated individuals can neutralize circulating SARS-CoV-

99

2 variants of concern and mutants that arise in vitro under antibody pressure 12,13, we tested

100

vaccinee plasma against a panel of 10 mutant pseudotype viruses including recently reported

101

N501Y (B1.1.7 variant), K417N, E484K and the combination of these 3 RBD mutations

102

(501Y.V2 variant)14-19. Vaccinee plasma was significantly less effective in neutralizing the HIV-

103

1 virus pseudotyped with certain SARS-CoV-2 mutant S proteins (Fig. 1h and i and Extended

104

Data Fig. 2j). Among the volunteer plasmas tested there was a 1- to 3-fold decrease in

105

neutralizing activity against E484K, N501Y and the K417N:E484K:N501Y combination (p=

106

0.0033, p=0.0002, and p<0.0001, respectively, Fig. 1h and i). Similarly, convalescent plasma

107

obtained 1.3 and 6.2 months after infection was 0.5- to 29- and 0.5- to 20.2-fold less effective in

108

neutralizing the K417N:E484K:N501Y combination (p=0.001 and p<0.0001, respectively, Fig.

109

1j, Extended Data Table 2). We conclude that the plasma neutralizing activity elicited by either

110

mRNA vaccination or natural infection is variably but significantly less effective against

111

pseudoviruses that carry RBD mutations found in emerging SARS-CoV-2 variants.

112
113

Vaccine-elicited SARS-CoV-2 RBD-specific monoclonal antibodies

114

Although circulating antibodies derived from plasma cells wane over time, long-lived immune

115

memory can persist in expanded clones of memory B cells7,20. We used flow cytometry to

116

enumerate the circulating SARS-CoV-2 RBD-specific memory B cells elicited by mRNA

117

immunization7,8 (Fig. 2a, Extended Data Fig. 3a and b). We focused on the RBD since it is the

118

target of the majority of the more potent SARS-CoV-2 neutralizing antibodies discovered to

119

date21-26. Notably, the percentage of RBD-binding memory B cells in vaccinees was significantly

120

greater than in naturally infected individuals assayed after 1.3 months, but similar to the same

121

individuals assayed after 6.2 months (Fig. 2b). The percentage of RBD-binding memory B cells

122

in vaccinees was not correlated to the time after vaccination (Extended Data Fig. 3c). Thus,

123

mRNA vaccination elicits a robust SARS-CoV-2 RBD-specific B cell memory response that

124

resembles natural infection.

125
126

To examine the nature of the antibodies produced by memory B cells in response to vaccination,

127

we obtained 1,409 paired antibody heavy and light chains from RBD binding single B cells from

128

14 individuals (n=10 Moderna and n=4 Pfizer-BioNTech vaccinees) (Extended Data Table 3).

129

Expanded clones of cells comprised 4-50% of the overall RBD binding memory B cell

130

compartment (Fig. 2c and d, and Extended Data Fig. 3d). Similar to natural infection, IGVH 3-

131

53, and 3-30 and some IGVL genes were significantly over-represented in the RBD-binding

132

memory B cell compartment of vaccinated individuals (Fig. 2e, Extended Data Fig. 4a). In

133

addition, antibodies that share the same combination of IGHV and IGLV genes in vaccinees

134

comprised 39% of all the clonal sequences (Extended Data Fig. 4b) and 59% when combined

135

with naturally infected individuals7,8 (Fig. 2f), and some of these antibodies were nearly identical

136

(Extended Data Table 3 and 4). The number of V gene nucleotide mutations in vaccinees is

137

greater than in naturally infected individuals assayed after 1.3 months, but lower than that in the

138

same individuals assayed after 6.2 months (Fig. 2g and Extended Data Fig. 5a). The length of the

139

IgH CDR3 was similar in both natural infected individuals and vaccinees and hydrophobicity

140

was below average27 (Fig. 2h and Extended Data Fig. 5a and b). Thus, the IgG memory response

141

is similar in individuals receiving the Pfizer-BioNTech and Moderna vaccines and both are rich

142

in recurrent and clonally expanded antibody sequences.

143
144

One hundred and twenty-seven representative antibodies from 8 individuals were expressed and

145

tested for reactivity to the RBD (Extended Data Table 5). The antibodies included: (1) 76 that

146

were randomly selected from those that appeared only once, and (2) 51 representatives of

147

expanded clones. Of the antibodies tested 98% (124 out of the 127) bound to RBD indicating

148

that single cell sorting by flow cytometry efficiently identified B cells producing anti-RBD

149

antibodies (Extended Data Fig. 6a-c and Table 5). In anti-RBD ELISAs the mean half-maximal

150

effective concentration (EC50) was higher than that observed in infected individuals after 6.2

151

months but not significantly different from antibodies obtained 1.3 months after infection

152

(Extended Data Fig. 6a, and Table 5 and 7,8). To examine memory B cell antibodies for binding

153

to circulating SARS-CoV-2 variants and antibody resistant mutants we performed ELISAs using

154

mutant RBDs12,15,28-31. Twenty-two (26%) of the 84 antibodies tested showed at least 5-fold

155

decreased binding to at least one of the mutant RBDs (Extended data Fig. 6d-n and Table 5).

156
157

SARS-CoV-2 S pseudotyped viruses were used to measure the neutralizing activity of all 127

158

antibodies7,8,10 (Fig. 3a, Extended Data Table 5). Consistent with the plasma neutralization

159

results, the geometric mean neutralization half-maximal inhibitory concentration of the Pfizer-

160

BioNTech and Moderna vaccinee antibodies were not significantly different from each other or

161

to antibody collections obtained from naturally infected individuals 1.3 or 6.2 months after

162

infection (Fig. 3a and 7,8).

163
164

To examine the neutralizing breadth of the monoclonal antibodies and begin to map their target

165

epitopes we tested 17 of the most potent antibodies (Extended data Table 6), 8 of which carried

166

IgHV3-53, against a panel of 12 SARS-CoV-2 variants: A475V is resistant to class 1 antibodies

167

(structurally defined as described29); E484K and Q493R are resistant to class 2

168

antibodies7,8,12,13,29,30,32,33; while R346S, N439K, and N440K are resistant to class 3

169

antibodies7,8,12,13,29,33. Additionally, K417N, Y453F, S477R, N501Y, and D614G represent

170

circulating variants some of which have been associated with rapidly increasing case

171

numbers14,15,19,33-35. Based on their neutralizing activity against the variants, all but 3 of the

172

antibodies were provisionally assigned to a defined antibody class or a combination (Fig. 3b). As

173

seen in natural infection, a majority of the antibodies tested (9/17) were at least ten-fold less

174

effective against pseudotyped viruses carrying the E484K mutation7,12,29. In addition, 5 of the

175

antibodies were less potent against K417N and 4 against N501Y by ten-fold or more (Fig. 3b).

176

Similar results were obtained with antibodies being developed for clinical use (REGN10987,

177

REGN10933, COV2-2196, COV2-2130, C135 and C144 (Extended data Fig. 7)). However,

178

antibody combinations remained effective against all of the variants tested confirming the

179

importance of using antibody combinations in the clinic (Extended data Fig. 7). Whether less

180

potent antibodies show similar degrees of sensitivity to these mutations remains to be

181

determined.

182
183

To determine whether antibody-imposed selection pressure could also drive the emergence of

184

resistance mutations in vitro, we cultured an rVSV/SARS-CoV-2 recombinant virus in the

185

presence of each of 18 neutralizing monoclonal antibodies. All of the tested antibodies selected

186

for RBD mutations. Moreover, in all cases the selected mutations corresponded to residues in the

187

binding sites of their presumptive antibody class (Fig. 3b and c). For example, antibody C627,

188

which was assigned to class 2 based on sensitivity to the E484K mutation, selected for the

189

emergence of the E484K mutation in vitro (Fig 3c). Notably, 6 of the antibodies selected for

190

K417N, E or T, 5 selected for E484K and 3 selected for N501Y, T or H, which coincide with

191

mutations present in the circulating B.1.1.17/501Y.V1, B.1.351/501Y.V2 and B1.1.28/501.V3

Cryo-EM Mapping of Antibody Epitopes

196

To further characterize antibody epitopes and mechanisms of neutralization, we characterized

197

seven complexes between mAb Fab fragments and the prefusion, stabilized ectodomain trimer of

198

SARS-CoV-2 S glycoprotein37 using single-particle cryo-EM (Fig 4 and Extended Data Table 7).

10

199

Overall resolutions ranged from 5-8 Å (Extended Data Fig. 8) and coordinates from S trimer and

200

representative Fab crystal structures were fit by rigid body docking into the cryo-EM density

201

maps to provide a general assessment of antibody footprints/RBD epitopes. Fab-S complexes

202

exhibited multiple RBD-binding orientations recognizing either ‘up’/’down’ (Fig 4a-j) or solely

203

‘up’ (Fig 4k-n) RBD conformations, consistent with structurally defined antibody classes from

204

natural infection (Fig 4o)29. The majority of mAbs characterized (6 of 7) recognized epitopes that

205

included RBD residues involved in ACE2 recognition, suggesting a neutralization mechanism

206

that directly blocks ACE2-RBD interactions. Additionally, structurally defined antibody epitopes

207

were consistent with RBD positions that were selected in rVSV/SARS-CoV-2 recombinant virus

208

outgrowth experiments, including residues K417, N439/N440, E484, and N501 (Fig 3c and Fig

209

4f-j,m,n). Taken together, these data suggest that functionally similar antibodies are raised during

210

vaccination and natural infection, and that the RBDs of spike trimers translated from the mRNA

211

delivered by vaccination adopt both ‘up’ and ’down’ conformations as observed on structures of

212

trimer ectodomains29 and trimers on the surface of SARS-CoV-2 virions38.

213
214

Discussion

215

The mRNA-based SARS-CoV-2 vaccines are safe and effective and being deployed globally to

216

prevent infection and disease. The vaccines elicit antibody responses against the RBD, the major

217

target of neutralizing antibodies21-26, in a manner that resembles natural infection. Notably, the

218

neutralizing antibodies produced by mRNA vaccination target the same epitopes as natural

219

infection. The data are consistent with SARS-CoV-2 spike trimers translated from the injected

220

RNA adopting a range of different conformations. Moreover, different individuals immunized

221

with either the Moderna (mRNA-1273) or Pfizer-BioNTech (BNT162b2) vaccines produce

222

closely related and nearly identical antibodies. Whether or not neutralizing antibodies to epitopes

223

other that RBD are elicited by vaccination remains to be determined.

224
225

Human neutralizing monoclonal antibodies to the SARS-CoV-2 RBD can be categorized as

226

belonging to 4 different classes based on their target regions on the RBD29. Class 1 and 2

227

antibodies are among the most potent and also the most abundant antibodies7,8,21,22,25,39. These

228

antibodies target epitopes that overlap or are closely associated with RBD residues K417, E484

229

and N501. They are frequently sensitive to mutation in these residues and select for K417N,

230

E484K and N501Y mutations in SARS-CoV-2 S protein expression libraries in yeast and VSV

231

12,15,33

232

antibodies that target non-overlapping or highly conserved epitopes8,12,13,33,40-44.

. To avert selection and escape, antibody therapies should be composed of combinations of

233
234

A number of circulating SARS-CoV-2 variants that have been associated with rapidly increasing

235

case numbers and have particular prevalence in the UK (B.1.1.7/501Y.V1), South Africa

236

(B.1.351/501Y.V2) and Brazil (P.1)14,17,18,36. Our experiments indicate that the RBD mutations

237

found in these variants, and potentially others that carry K417N/T, E484K and N501Y

238

mutations, can reduce the neutralization potency of vaccinee and convalescent plasma against

239

SARS-CoV-2 pseudotyped viruses. Although our assays are limited to pseudotyped viruses there

240

is an excellent correlation between pseudotyped and authentic SARS-CoV-2 neutralization

241

assays10. In addition, similar results have been reported by others using vaccinee and

242

convalescent plasmas and a variety of different pseudotype and authentic virus assays15,31,45-49.

244

The comparatively modest effects of the mutations on viral sensitivity to plasma reflects the

245

polyclonal nature of the neutralizing antibodies in vaccinee plasma. Nevertheless, emergence of

246

these particular variants is consistent with the dominance of the class 1 and 2 antibody response

247

in infected or vaccinated individuals. We speculate that these mutations emerged in response to

248

immune selection in individuals with non-sterilizing immunity. What the long-term effect of

249

accumulation of mutations on the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic will be is not known, but the common

250

cold coronavirus HCoV-229E evolves antigenic variants that are comparatively resistant to the

251

older sera but remain sensitive to contemporaneous sera50. Thus, it is possible that these

252

mutations and others that emerge in individuals with suboptimal or waning immunity will erode

253

the effectiveness of natural and vaccine elicited immunity. The data suggests that SARS-CoV-2

254

vaccines and antibody therapies may need to be updated and immunity monitored in order to

255

compensate for viral evolution.

351

Study participants.

352

To isolate and characterize anti-SARS-CoV-2 RBD antibodies from vaccinees, a cohort

353

of 20 individuals that participated in either the Moderna or Pfizer-BioNTech phase 3 vaccine

354

clinical trials and did not report prior history of SARS-CoV-2 infection was recruited at the NIH

355

Blood Center and the Rockefeller University Hospital for blood donation. Eligible participants

356

included adults, at least 18 years of age with no known heart, lung, kidney disease or bleeding

357

disorders, no history of HIV-1 or malaria infection. All participants were asymptomatic at the

358

time of the study visit and had received a complete 2 dose regimen of either mRNA vaccine.

359

Informed consent was obtained from all participants and the study was conducted in accordance

360

with Good Clinical Practice. The study visits and blood draws were reviewed and approved

361

under the National Institutes of Health’s Federalwide Assurance (FWA00005897), in accordance

362

with Federal regulations 45 CFR 46 and 21 CFR 5 by the NIH Intramural Research Program IRB

363

committee (IRB# 99CC0168, Collection and Distribution of Blood Components from Healthy

364

Donors for In Vitro Research Use) and by the Institutional Review Board of the Rockefeller

365

University (IRB# DRO-1006, Peripheral Blood of Coronavirus Survivors to Identify Virus-

366

Blood samples processing and storage.

369

Samples collected at NIH were drawn from participants at the study visit and processed within

370

24 hours. Briefly, whole blood samples were subjected to Ficoll gradient centrifugation after 1:1

371

dilution in PBS. Plasma and PBMC samples were obtained through phase separation of plasma

372

layer and Buffy coat phase, respectively. PBMCs were further prepared through centrifugation,

373

red blood cells lysis and washing steps, and stored in CellBanker cell freezing media

374

(Amsbio). All samples were aliquoted and stored at - 80 °C and shipped on dry ice. Prior to

375

experiments, aliquots of plasma samples were heat-inactivated (56°C for 1 hour) and then stored

376

at 4°C. Peripheral Blood Mononuclear Cells (PBMCs) obtained from samples collected at

377

Rockefeller University were purified as previously reported7,8 by gradient centrifugation and

378

stored in liquid nitrogen in the presence of FCS and DMSO. Heparinized plasma samples were

379

aliquoted and stored at -20°C or less. Prior to experiments, aliquots of plasma samples were heat-

380

inactivated (56°C for 1 hour) and then stored at 4°C.

ELISAs

383

ELISAs51,52 to evaluate antibodies binding to SARS-CoV-2 S (BioHub), RBD and additional

384

mutated RBDs were performed by coating of high-binding 96-half-well plates (Corning 3690)

385

with 50 μl per well of a 1μg/ml protein solution in PBS overnight at 4 °C. Plates were washed 6

386

times with washing buffer (1× PBS with 0.05% Tween-20 (Sigma-Aldrich)) and incubated with

387

170 μl per well blocking buffer (1× PBS with 2% BSA and 0.05% Tween-20 (Sigma)) for 1 h at

388

room temperature. Immediately after blocking, monoclonal antibodies or plasma samples were

389

added in PBS and incubated for 1 h at room temperature. Plasma samples were assayed at a

390

1:66.6 (RU samples) or a 1:33.3 (NIH samples) starting dilution and 7 additional threefold serial

391

dilutions. Monoclonal antibodies were tested at 10 μg/ml starting concentration and 10 additional

392

fourfold serial dilutions. Plates were washed 6 times with washing buffer and then incubated

393

with anti-human IgG, IgM or IgA secondary antibody conjugated to horseradish peroxidase

394

(HRP) (Jackson Immuno Research 109-036-088 109-035-129 and Sigma A0295) in blocking

395

buffer at a 1:5,000 dilution (IgM and IgG) or 1:3,000 dilution (IgA). Plates were developed by

396

addition of the HRP substrate, TMB (ThermoFisher) for 10 min (plasma samples) or 4 minutes

397

(monoclonal antibodies), then the developing reaction was stopped by adding 50 μl 1 M H2SO4

398

and absorbance was measured at 450 nm with an ELISA microplate reader (FluoStar Omega,

399

BMG Labtech) with Omega and Omega MARS software for analysis. For plasma samples, a

400

positive control (plasma from participant COV727,8, diluted 66.6-fold and with seven additional

401

threefold serial dilutions in PBS) was added to every assay plate for validation. The average of

402

its signal was used for normalization of all of the other values on the same plate with Excel

403

software before calculating the area under the curve using Prism V8.4 (GraphPad). For

404

monoclonal antibodies, the EC50 was determined using four-parameter nonlinear regression

414

293TAce2 8, 293T/ACE2.cl22 and HT1080/ACE2.cl14 cells10 were cultured in Dulbecco’s

415

Modified Eagle Medium (DMEM) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS) at 37oC

416

and 5% CO2. Cells were periodically tested for contamination with mycoplasma or retroviruses.

417

rVSV/SARS-CoV-2/GFP chimeric virus stocks were generated by infecting 293T/ACE2.cl22

418

cells. Supernatant was harvested 1 day post infection (dpi), cleared of cellular debris, and stored

419

at -80oC. A plaque purified variant designated rVSV/SARS-CoV-2/GFP2E1 that encodes

420

D215G/R683G substitutions was used in these studies10.

422

Selection and analysis of antibody escape mutations

423

For the selection of monoclonal antibody-resistant spike variants, an rVSV/SARS-CoV-2/GFP2E1

424

(for details see10) population containing 106 infectious units was incubated with monoclonal

425

antibodies at 10-40 μg/ml for 1 hr at 37 °C. The virus-antibody mixtures were subsequently

426

incubated with 5× 105 293T/ACE2cl.22 cells in 6-well plates. One day after infection the media

427

was replaced with fresh media containing the equivalent concentration of antibodies. Supernatant

428

was harvested 2 days after infection and 150 μl of the cleared supernatant was used to infect cells

429

for passage 2, while 150 μl was subjected to RNA extraction and sequencing.

430

For identification of putative antibody resistance mutations, RNA was extracted using

431

NucleoSpin 96 Virus Core Kit (Macherey-Nagel). The RNA was reversed transcribed using the

432

SuperScript VILO cDNA Synthesis Kit (Thermo Fisher Scientific). KOD Xtreme Hot Start DNA

433

Polymerase (Millipore Sigma) was used for amplification of cDNA using primers flanking the S-

434

encoding sequence. The PCR products were purified and sequenced as previously described7,12.

435

Briefly, tagmentation reactions were performed using 1ul diluted cDNA, 0.25 µl Nextera TDE1

436

Tagment DNA enzyme (catalog no. 15027865), and 1.25 µl TD Tagment DNA buffer (catalog

437

no. 15027866; Illumina). Next, the DNA was ligated to unique i5/i7 barcoded primer

438

combinations using the Illumina Nextera XT Index Kit v2 and KAPA HiFi HotStart ReadyMix

439

(2X; KAPA Biosystems) and purified using AmPure Beads XP (Agencourt), after which the

440

samples were pooled into one library and subjected to paired-end sequencing using Illumina

441

MiSeq Nano 300 V2 cycle kits (Illumina) at a concentration of 12pM.

442

For analysis of the sequencing data, the raw paired-end reads were pre-processed to remove trim

443

adapter sequences and to remove low-quality reads (Phred quality score < 20) using BBDuk.

444

Reads were mapped to the rVSV/SARS-CoV-2/GFP sequence using Geneious Prime (Version

445

2020.1.2). Mutations were annotated using Geneious Prime, with a P-value cutoff of

446

10−6. Because reads have randomly generated ends and different lengths, the mutations do not

447

necessarily have to occur on the same read. e.g K417N and N501Y might occur on the same read

448

or on different reads. The percentages calculated for position X are calculated based on all the

449

reads, and not just the reads, that include position X.

SARS-CoV-2 pseudotyped reporter virus

452

A panel of plasmids expressing RBD-mutant SARS-CoV-2 spike proteins in the context of

453

pSARS-CoV-2-S Δ19 (based on (NC_045512)) have been described previously12. Additional

454

substitutions were introduced using either PCR primer-mediated mutagenesis or with synthetic

455

gene fragments (IDT) followed by Gibson assembly. The mutants E484K and KEN

456

(K417N+E484K+N501Y) were constructed in the context of a pSARS-CoV-2-S Δ19 variant with

457

a mutation in the furin cleavage site (R683G). The NT50s and IC50 of these pseudotypes were

458

compared to a wildtype SARS-CoV-2 spike sequence carrying R683G in the subsequent

459

analyses, as appropriate.

460

Generation of SARS-CoV-2 pseudotyped HIV-1 particles was performed as previously

461

described8. Briefly, 293T cells were transfected with pNL4-3DEnv-nanoluc and pSARS-CoV-2-

462

SΔ19 and pseudotyped virus stocks were harvested 48 hours after transfection, filtered and stored

463

at -80℃.

465

SARS-CoV-2 pseudotype neutralization assays

466

Plasma or monoclonal antibodies from vaccine recipients were four-fold or five-fold serially

467

diluted and then incubated with SARS-CoV-2 pseudotyped HIV-1 reporter virus for 1 h at 37 °C.

468

The antibody and pseudotyped virus mixture was added to 293TAce2 cells8 (for comparisons of

469

plasma or monoclonal antibodies from COVID-19-convalescents and vaccine recipients) or

470

HT1080ACE2.cl14 cells10 (for analysis of spike mutants with vaccine recipient plasma or

471

monoclonal antibodies). After 48 h cells were washed with PBS and lysed with Luciferase Cell

472

Culture Lysis 5× reagent (Promega) and Nanoluc Luciferase activity in lysates was measured

473

using the Nano-Glo Luciferase Assay System (Promega) with the Glomax Navigator (Promega).

474

The relative luminescence units were normalized to those derived from cells infected with

475

SARS-CoV-2 pseudotyped virus in the absence of plasma or monoclonal antibodies. The half-

476

maximal and 80% or 90% neutralization titers for plasma (NT50 and NT80/NT90, respectively) or

477

half-maximal and 90% inhibitory concentrations for monoclonal antibodies (IC50 and IC90,

478

respectively) were determined using four-parameter nonlinear regression (least squares

cells was reverse-transcribed (SuperScript III Reverse Transcriptase, Invitrogen, 18080-044) and

509

the cDNA stored at −20 °C or used for subsequent amplification of the variable IGH, IGL and

510

IGK genes by nested PCR and Sanger sequencing. Sequence analysis was performed using

511

MacVector. Amplicons from the first PCR reaction were used as templates for sequence- and

512

ligation-independent cloning into antibody expression vectors. Recombinant monoclonal

513

antibodies and Fabs were produced and purified as previously described8.

514
515

Cryo-EM sample preparation

516

Expression and purification of SARS-CoV-2 6P stabilized S trimers37 was conducted as

517

previously described53. Purified Fab and S 6P trimer were incubated at a 1.1:1 molar ratio per

518

protomer on ice for 30 minutes prior to deposition on a freshly glow-discharged 300 mesh,

519

1.2/1.3 Quantifoil copper grid. Immediately before 3 µl of complex was applied to the grid,

520

fluorinated octyl-malotiside was added to the Fab-S complex to a final detergent concentration of

521

0.02% w/v, resulting in a final complex concentration of 3 mg/ml. Samples were vitrified in

522

100% liquid ethane using a Mark IV Vitrobot after blotting for 3 s with Whatman No. 1 filter

523

paper at 22˚C and 100% humidity.

Cryo-EM data collection and processing

526

Data collection and processing followed a similar workflow to what has been previously

527

described in detail29. Briefly, micrographs were collected on a Talos Arctica transmission

electron microscope (Thermo Fisher) operating at 200 kV for all Fab-S complexes. Data were

529

collected using SerialEM automated data collection software54 and movies were recorded with a

530

K3 camera (Gatan). For all datasets, cryo-EM movies were patch motion corrected for beam-

531

induced motion including dose-weighting within cryoSPARC v2.1555 after binning super

532

resolution movies. The non-dose-weighted images were used to estimate CTF parameters using

533

cryoSPARC implementation of the Patch CTF job. Particles were picked using Blob picker and

534

extracted 4x binned and 2D classified. Class averages corresponding to distinct views with

535

secondary structure features were chosen and ab initio models were generated. 3D classes that

536

showed features of a Fab-S complex were re-extracted, unbinned (0.869 Å/pixel) and

537

homogenously refined with C1 symmetry. Overall resolutions were reported based on gold

538

standard FSC calculations.

539
540

Cryo-EM Structure Modeling and Refinement

541

Coordinates for initial complexes were generated by docking individual chains from reference

542

structures into cryo-EM density using UCSF Chimera56 (S trimer: PDB 6KXL, Fab: PDB 6XCA

543

or 7K8P after trimming CDR3 loops and converting to a polyalanine model). Models were then

544

refined into cryo-EM maps by rigid body and real space refinement in Phenix57. If the resolution

545

allowed, partial CDR3 loops were built manually in Coot58 and then refined using real-space

546

refinement in Phenix.

547
548

Computational analyses of antibody sequences

549

Antibody sequences were trimmed based on quality and annotated using Igblastn v.1.14. with

550

IMGT domain delineation system. Annotation was performed systematically using Change-O

toolkit v.0.4.540 59. Heavy and light chains derived from the same cell were paired, and

552

clonotypes were assigned based on their V and J genes using in-house R and Perl scripts (Fig. 2c

553

and f, Extended data Fig. 3d, Extended data Fig. 4b). All scripts and the data used to process

554

antibody sequences are publicly available on GitHub (https://github.com/stratust/igpipeline).

556

The frequency distributions of human V genes in anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies from this study

557

was compared to 131,284,220 IgH and IgL sequences generated by 60 and downloaded from

558

cAb-Rep 61, a database of human shared BCR clonotypes available at https://cab-

559

rep.c2b2.columbia.edu/. Based on the 97 distinct V genes that make up the 4186 analyzed

560

sequences from Ig repertoire of the 14 participants present in this study, we selected the IgH and

561

IgL sequences from the database that are partially coded by the same V genes and counted them

562

according to the constant region. The frequencies shown in (Fig 2e and Extended Data Fig 4a)

563

are relative to the source and isotype analyzed. We used the two-sided binomial test to check

564

whether the number of sequences belonging to a specific IgHV or IgLV gene in the repertoire is

565

different according to the frequency of the same IgV gene in the database. Adjusted p-values

566

were calculated using the false discovery rate (FDR) correction. Significant differences are

567

denoted with stars.

568
569

Nucleotide somatic hypermutation and CDR3 length were determined using in-house R and Perl

570

scripts. For somatic hypermutations, IGHV and IGLV nucleotide sequences were aligned against

571

their closest germlines using Igblastn and the number of differences were considered nucleotide

572

mutations. The average mutations for V genes were calculated by dividing the sum of all

573

nucleotide mutations across all participants by the number of sequences used for the analysis. To

578

study and 22,654,256 IGH CDR3 sequences from the public database of memory B cell receptor

579

sequences64. The two-tailed Wilcoxon nonparametric test was used to test whether there is a

580

difference in hydrophobicity distribution.
