Abstract
The novel coronavirus respiratory syndrome (COVID-19) has now spread worldwide. The relative
contribution of viral transmission via fomites is still unclear. SARS-CoV-2 has been shown to survive
on inanimate surfaces for several days, yet the factors that determine its survival on surfaces are not
well understood. Here we combine microscopy imaging with virus viability assays to study survival
of three bacteriophages suggested as good models for human respiratory pathogens: the enveloped
Phi6 (a surrogate for SARS-CoV-2), and the non-enveloped PhiX174 and MS2. We measured virus
viability in human saliva microdroplets, SM buffer, and water following deposition on glass surfaces
at various relative humidities (RH). Although saliva microdroplets dried out rapidly at all tested RH
levels (unlike SM that remained hydrated at RH ≥ 57%), survival of all three viruses in dry saliva
microdroplets was significantly higher than in water or SM. Thus, RH and hydration conditions are
not sufficient to explain virus survival, indicating that the suspended medium, and association with
saliva components in particular, likely affect physicochemical properties that determine virus
survival. The observed high virus survival in dry saliva deposited on surfaces, under a wide range of
RH levels, can have profound implications for human public health, specifically the COVID-19
pandemic.
Introduction
The novel human coronavirus that emerged in China in late 2019 caused a pandemic. Human saliva
microdroplets expelled into the air through coughing, talking, and breathing are considered a key
source of transmission of the virus 1,2. These microdroplets, ranging in size between few micrometers
up to millimeters 3-5 travel in the air, while some of them – larger ones in particular – settle on surfaces
2

. Thus, inanimate surfaces are a potential medium of virus transmission

1,2,6,7

. Like many other

viruses, SARS-CoV-2 has been shown to survive well and remain viable on various surfaces, e.g.,
metal, glass, and plastic, for up to several days 8-10. While not necessarily viable, SARS-CoV-2 RNA
has been detected on surfaces in contaminated sites such as hospitals 11-14.

The factors that affect virus survival in droplets that settle on surfaces are complex and not well
understood. Survival is expected to depend upon the physicochemical characteristics and hydration
conditions of the immediate microscopic environment of the virion. These in turn are determined by
several factors, including the composition of the fluid comprising the droplets, the surface properties,
the ambient temperature, and the relative humidity (RH). A preeminent source for expelled droplets
is human saliva, a complex solution that contains salts, a variety of proteins, and surfactants 15-18. It
has been suggested that micrometer-sized dry deposits of saliva droplets on surfaces protect virions
19

. Still, it is not clear how well viruses survive in saliva microdroplets following their deposition on

surfaces, and what factors are in play therein. The impact of RH on the stability and viability of
SARS-CoV-2 and other enveloped viruses has been studied mostly in airborne droplets or aerosols
20-26

and less on surfaces 27-29.

While survival varies between virus species, increased survival at both low (<40%) and very high
(>90%) RH is often observed, with decreased survival at intermediate RH levels

20-22,25,27

. The

underlying mechanism of this U-shaped survival as a function of RH is not clear 24. Only a few studies
have attempted to gain mechanistic understanding of how RH affects virus stability in microdroplets.
Prominent among these are the pioneering studies of the Marr group 5,24,26,30, which point to the role
of the solvent composition, evaporation dynamics, and RH on virus survival in aerosols and sessile
droplets.
A key factor determining the evaporation rate and equilibrium hydration level of drying droplets
on surfaces (and in air as well) is the deliquescence property of solutes, or mostly highly hygroscopic
salts 31-33. Accordingly, although many surfaces in the indoor environment appear dry, they are in fact
covered by thin liquid films and micrometer-sized droplets, invisible to the naked eye, known as
microscopic surface wetness, or MSW 34. MSW can be considered the “envelope” that accommodates
microorganisms on surfaces, and as such has profound impact on many aspects of microbial life. For
example, it can protect microbes from complete desiccation. However, MSW is a harsh microenvironment that differs in its properties from bulk liquid. MSW inherently arises from drying liquids
that evaporate on a surface. This drying process is accompanied by physicochemical changes such as
solute concentrations, pH, reactive oxygenic species, surface tension, and others. At the microscale,
gradients, local densities, and surface irregularity introduce heterogeneity to MSW environments 18,3537

. Collectively, MSW imposes severe stresses on microbes therein – including viruses – and affects

their survival 18,26,27,38,39.
The current study, motivated by the urgent call for the scientific community to address SARSCoV-2 spread, aims to explore the link between microscopic surface wetness and virus survival
therein. We focus on two variables that directly affect MSW – solution composition and RH levels –

and seek to determine whether and how it is reflected by virus survival trends. We used
bacteriophages suggested as good, safe, and easy to work with, model surrogates to study surface and
air survival of pathogenic viruses 40-42. We chose to study three phages: the enveloped Phi6 – proposed
as a good surrogate for SARS coronaviruses – and two other tailless non-enveloped model
bacteriophages as a reference. Phi6 is a dsRNA phage of the Cystoviridae family that has been
suggested as a good surrogate for studying enveloped RNA viruses 18,22,40,43-45; similar to SARS-CoV2, it is enveloped by a lipid membrane, has spike proteins, and is of similar size (~80-100 nm). The
other virus strains we used are the well-studied, non-enveloped MS2 (ssRNA; Leviviridae) 41,46-48 and
PhiX174 (ssDNA; Microviridae) 41,49. To better understand how RH and the solution composition of
microdroplets affect virus survival on surfaces, we combine microscopy imaging to assess MSW state
with plaque assays to determine virus infectivity. We compare survival in ‘sprayed’ microdroplets of
three suspensions: human saliva, SM buffer, and ‘pure’ water under a range of RH (23%-78%)
relevant to the indoor environment. The link between the microscopic environment of viruses,
including hydration conditions, and virus viability is discussed.

Materials and Methods
Bacteria and bacteriophage strains
Bacteriophages Phi6 (DSM-21518), PhiX174 (DSM-4497), and MS2 (DSM-13767) were purchased
from DSMZ. Vacuum-dried phages were revitalized according to DSMZ instructions. Bacteriophage
propagation: Overnight bacterial host cultures were diluted at 1:50 into 1 ml fresh media and grown
to OD600 0.3. A single plaque, suspended in 100 µl SM buffer, was used to inoculate the fresh culture.
The first propagation was shake incubated at the appropriate temperature for the host strain for 3 hrs,
or until lysis was observed. Meanwhile, the overnight cultures were diluted again in 9 ml fresh media
and grown to OD600 0.3. The first propagation was then diluted with the 9 ml fresh host cultures and
grown for 3 hrs or until lysis was observed. The second propagation was centrifuged (4,200RCF, 10
minutes) and filtered through a 0.22 µm filter (Millex® GV). Phages were stored at 4°C and their
concentrations were determined by the drop plaque assay. Pseudomonas syringae (DSM-21482), a
host strain for bacteriophage Phi6, was purchased from the German Collection of Microorganisms
and Cell Cultures (DSMZ) and cultivated in TSB (Tryptic Soy Broth) at 28°C. Escherichia coli
(DSM-13127), a host strain for bacteriophage PhiX174, was purchased from the German Collection
of Microorganisms and Cell Cultures (DSMZ) and cultivated in LB (Luria Bertani broth) at 37°C.
Escherichia coli (ATCC® 15597™) (kindly provided by Adi Stern), a host strain for bacteriophage
MS2, was cultivated in LB (Luria Bertani broth) at 37°C.

Phage stock solution (108 PFU/ml for Phi6; and MS2 and 107 PFU/ml for PhiX174) were diluted
100fold with: (1) SM Buffer (100 mM NaCl, 8mM MgSO4×7H2O, 50 mM Tris-Cl pH 7.5, 0.01%
w/v gelatin) (2) filter-sterilized H2O (W4502, sigma) and (3) natural human saliva (donated by one
of the authors). Fluorescent beads (2 µm, melamine resin labeled by rhodamine B, 94009 Fluka) were
added to the suspension with a 5x102 final dilution. Solutions were loaded into 5ml refillable spray
bottles (purchased at a local cosmetics store) and a portion of the load was sprayed on a 12-well glass
bottom plate (P12-1.5H-N, Cellvis). Each well was sprayed by pressing the spray nozzle twice,
delivering a volume of ~50 µl). Spray was applied to the well through a 50 ml falcon tube from which
we chopped 1.5 cm from its conical end. The plates were placed without the cover lid inside a sealed
plastic box. A 100 ml saturated salt solution was placed in the bottom of each box to maintain relative
humidity of 23, 43, 57, and 78% (potassium acetate, potassium carbonate, sodium bromide, and
ammonium chloride respectively). The boxes were placed in an incubator set at 25°C for 14 hrs.
Control: spray bottles with the remaining (unsprayed) suspensions were left in incubation for 14 hrs
and sprayed onto the 12-well plates at the end of the incubation period. All plates were imaged at the
end of the 14-hr incubation period and then suspended with 500 µl of SM buffer for the drop plaque
assay.
Virus Plaque Assay
Plates containing the bottom agar layer were poured in advance (TSB or LB with 15g/l agar, 5 mM
MgSO4, and 5 mM CaCl2). On the day of the experiment, overnight bacterial host cultures were
diluted at 1:50 into 1 ml fresh media and shake incubated until they reached OD600 0.3. Meanwhile,
the top agar (TSB or LB with 7.5g/l agar, 5 mM MgSO4, and 5 mM CaCl2) was melted and kept in a
55°C water bath. The bacterial culture was combined with the top agar at a ratio of 1:40, and poured
on top of the bottom layer. The phages were serially diluted in SM buffer, and after the top agar
solidified, either 10 µl, 100 µl, or 1000 µl were pipetted and spread out onto either one quarter, one
half, or a full plate (10x10 cm petri dish) respectively. Plates were left open until dry and incubated
at the appropriate temperature for the host strain (as described above) overnight.
Microscopy
12-well plates were mounted on a stage top without warming (room temperature) during image
acquisition. Images were collected using an Eclipse Ti-E inverted epi-fluorescence microscope
(Nikon, Japan) equipped with a Plan Apo 20x/0.75 NA air objective and the Perfect Focus System
for maintenance of focus. An LED light source (SOLA SE II, Lumencor) was used for fluorescence
excitation. Rhodamine B-marked fluorescent beads were excited through a 560/40 filter, and emission
was collected with a T585lpxr dichroic mirror and 630/75 filter (filter cube #49008, Chroma). Images
were acquired with a SCMOS camera (ZYLA 4.2PLUS, Andor Technology Ltd., UK) controlled

with NIS Elements 5.02 software (Nikon Instruments Inc., USA). 10x10 adjacent fields of views
(covering a total area of 2.82 x 2.82 mm) were monitored per each well. Multiple stage positions were
collected using a motorized encoded scanning stage (SCANplus IM 130 x 85, Märzhäuse).

Results
To study virus survival in microdroplets deposited on a smooth inanimate surface, we sprayed
Phi6, MS2, and PhiX174 viruses suspended in three media – human saliva, water, and SM buffer –
on glass-bottom 12-well plates (Fig. 1, Methods). Fluorescent beads (2 µm in diameter) in an
equivalent concentration to those of the Phi6 and MS2 viruses (~106/ml), were added to the
suspension for two purposes: (i) to mimic micrometer-sized particulates (e.g., bacteria cells) that are
spread on real-world surfaces and have been shown to affect the formation of microscopic surface
wetness 34; and to (ii) help interpret the virion distribution within droplets. Sprayed microdroplet size
ranged between tens to hundreds of microns in diameter (Fig. 2 A,B), which falls within the range of
respiratory fluid microdroplets exhaled while coughing, speaking, and breathing

4,5

and gravitate

toward surfaces (i.e., not the < 5 µm aerosols). As this study’s emphasis is virus survival in the indoor
environment, we chose to work at a temperature of 25℃ and a range of RH (23% to 78%) that spans
most indoor environments 50. The sprayed well plates were placed under constant temperature and
RH conditions for 14 hrs, and subsequently microscopy images were taken and virus survival was
estimated by the plaque assay using the corresponding bacterial host as a reporter for infectivity (Fig.
1, Methods).
To better understand the microscale hydration state that viruses experience, we first examined the
surfaces under the microscope 14 hrs post deposition. Representative images of the surface at t = 14
hrs are shown in Fig 3. Both the saliva and water microdroplets appeared completely dry at all tested
RHs. As can be seen in Fig. 3, saliva microdroplets left a thin layer deposit (~3-5 µm thickness) of
dry matter wherein natural bacterial flora could be seen as well as other aggregated substances, some
of them are clearly salt crystals, but not all (somewhat similar to

18

). Beads were dispersed fairly

uniformly within these microdroplet deposits, as previously demonstrated for virions

18

. While the

beads are at least an order of magnitude larger than individual virions, their visualization can help us
grasp the concentration of virions in droplets, and possibly their spatial distribution (assuming lack
of virion aggregation, see Discussion). A back-of-the-envelope calculation estimated ~10 virions in
a 100-µm droplet, which is consistent with the observed bead distribution (Fig. 3).
Water microdroplets dried out at all RH levels. This observation is not surprising, as the water
suspension contained very low concentrations of deliquescent solutes (e.g., salts). At RH = 78%,
some tiny microdroplets (~ few µms in diameter) were observed around single beads or small bead

clusters (Fig. 3). These tiny water microdroplets were likely retained due to strong capillary forces.
In contrast, SM buffer microdroplets were hydrated at 57% RH and above (Fig. 3). Stable
microdroplets of tens of µms in diameter could be clearly seen (Fig. 3). At RH = 43%, some of the
microdroplets, but not all, dried out and salt crystals were observed. At RH = 23%, all microdroplets
dried out and only salt crystals were seen (Fig. 3). These observations can be explained by the point
of efflorescence of NaCl, the major solute in SM buffer: ~45-48% RH 51.
Next, we estimated virus survival under all tested conditions. The bottom surface of each well was
suspended, and viral infectivity levels (PFU/ml) in the suspensions were evaluated by the plaque
assay (Fig. 4 - see Methods). Virus viability in sprayed droplets (saliva, water, and SM buffer) was
compared with that of suspended virus in bulk medium that was kept in sealed tubes throughout the
duration of the experiment as a control. Strikingly, the highest survival of all tested viruses was found
in evaporated saliva microdroplet deposits with less than 1.5 order of magnitude reduction in
infectivity. A non-monotonous U-shaped survival as a function of RH was observed for Phi6 and
PhiX174 with highest survival at 23% (even somewhat higher than the control). This is consistent
with previous observations on superhydrophobic surfaces 18.
Similar to saliva, water microdroplets were dry at all RH levels. This appears to have a large impact
on the enveloped virus Phi6, which showed more than 4 orders of magnitude reduction in infectivity
(Fig. 4). In contrast, the two non-enveloped viruses showed lower reduction in infectivity (1-3 orders
of magnitude, Fig. 4). While PhiX174 survival in evaporated water droplets increased with RH,
hydration conditions did not show any noticeable change (Fig. 3). MS2 survival in water was lower
than that in saliva, with a U-shaped RH dependence.
In the SM buffer, while microdroplets remained hydrated at 78% and 57% RH (Fig. 3), survival
of all three viruses was lower than in saliva under the corresponding RH levels. The only exception
was PhiX174, which exhibited similar survival levels in SM and saliva at 78% RH. Overall, Phi6,
PhiX174, and MS2 in SM buffer deposits showed 3-4 orders of magnitude reduction in infectivity
across the tested RH range, exhibiting the familiar U-shaped trend.

Discussion
Aiming to obtain some mechanistic insights into factors that determine virus survival in
microdroplets deposited on surfaces, we explored a wide range of RH, three types of solutions, and
three model viruses (enveloped and non-enveloped). Combining surface microscopy imaging and
infective virus enumeration, we were able to explore the link between the tested variables as
manifested with respect to microscopic surface wetness and virus survival.

Our results indicate that RH and hydration conditions are not sufficient to explain virus survival
in microdroplets deposited on surfaces. For example, the log reduction of Phi6 at 78% RH was ≈1,
≈3, and ≈5 when suspended in saliva, SM buffer, and H2O respectively. This is in contrast to high
and comparable virus survival in bulk solution (control) of all tested media (Fig. 4). This implies that
the physicochemical changes that characterize a microdroplet’s drying process have a pivotal
implication for virus survival. Thus, the effect of RH on virus survival is context dependent. Likewise,
SM droplets were hydrated at 78% RH and completely desiccated at 23% RH. Nonetheless, Phi6
survival under all of these widely differing hydration states was comparable (and all showing ~3-4
log reduction). We conclude that water availability and hydration status of a droplet cannot explain
virus survival on its own. The observation that at a given RH, the microscopic hydration conditions
of deposited droplets of various media can differ so widely (see along the rows of Fig. 3) suggests
that RH does not directly affect virus stability and infectivity in drying microdroplets deposited on
surfaces, but rather RH indirectly affects survival through its effect on physicochemical conditions at
the scale that matters for viruses (~ µm).
Remarkably, both enveloped and non-enveloped viruses survive well in evaporated human saliva
microdroplets deposited on inanimate surfaces at a wide range of RH levels. The observation that
saliva droplets were completely dry even at 78% RH was somewhat surprising, as we expected saliva
to effloresce at 40-50% RH

51

. Human saliva is a complex fluid that somehow protects viruses in

drying droplets and aerosols 18,19. A rough approximation estimates that in our experiments, droplets
of ~100 microns in diameter contained around 10 virions. Thus, the mass of salts, proteins, and
surfactants in these droplets are a few orders of magnitude higher than the total virion mass 18. As
suggested by Marr et al., association between virion and saliva proteins (or other components) can
protect the virions for prolonged periods (even days) in such dry saliva droplets on surfaces. In
addition, the lower content of inorganic salts in saliva 52 than that in SM buffer may explain part of
the large differences in virion survival between the two solutions. We remark that bacteriophage
survival in human saliva is puzzling considering the fact that they are not expected to be selected by
evolution for high survival in human saliva, unless they are infecting bacteria of the human
microbiomes. We hypothesize that the structural stability of both human viruses and bacteriophages
is an old, shared trait that is deeply entrenched in the evolution of viruses.
A second remarkable result is the very low survival (~5 log reduction) of Phi6 in the evaporated
water microdroplets, regardless of RH. This is in stark contrast to the non-enveloped viruses that
showed only moderate log reduction (~2) and moderate survival under high RH (78%). This result
may indicate damage associated with the lipid membrane of the enveloped phage under these
conditions. We note that in the bulk water, survival of Phi6 was high and comparable to that in SM

buffer and saliva. A possible explanation therefor may be attributed to pH changes that occur during
evaporation

18

. The absence of protecting components such as salt crystals or saliva proteins may

cause the damage.
This indicates that the physicochemical properties, experienced by the virions in the SM droplets
from time of deposition through evaporation until reaching equilibrium, affect virus stability and
viability. The dramatic increase in salt concentrations, and/or the time of exposure to high salt
concentrations and reduced pH likely cause damage to the virus. This in turn suggests that the
evaporation kinetics of suspended droplets on surfaces may affect the survival of viruses, in a similar
manner as that suggested in aerosol droplets

24

. Thus, complete dryness could in fact protect the

virions from those high concentrations of dissolved salts and low pH 5,19.
Note that virus viability requires both physical stability of the virion and functionality, i.e., the
ability to infect host cells and replicate. These in turn likely require stability of the capsid or envelope
(depending on virus type), and that the relevant proteins (e.g., spike proteins), which play a role in
attachment to host cells, remain functional. While the results of this study could not resolve between
stability and infectivity, the differences between enveloped and non-enveloped viruses suggest that
reduction in physical stability plays a role in virus viability.
Another less-understood issue is viral aggregation

53,54

. Spontaneous aggregation of virions, for

example as a response to changes in salt concentrations and pH

46,53,55

, may occur in drying

microdroplets, and thus may play a role in virus survival. We speculate that with lipid-enveloped
viruses suspended in water, aggregation of viruses imposed by hydrophobicity or other mechanisms,
might play a vital role. If significant viral aggregation occurs, it has implications for interpretation of
PFU/ml survival estimations (true for any virus survival study), and for the distribution of virions in
drying droplets. Large virion aggregates (> tens of virions) might also affect microdroplets’ drying
dynamics due to capillary pinning, as we have shown for bacteria 34.
The results of this study provide important insights concerning the COVID-19 pandemic.
Although performed with a surrogate for SARS-CoV-2, it indicates, along with other studies, that
SARS-CoV-2 survives well in evaporated saliva droplets on inanimate surfaces. Because SARS-Cov2 transmission appears to depend upon viral load, it is likely that in indoor environments where
infected individuals stay for long periods, viable viruses persist on fomites for days. Thus, as long as
not proved otherwise, indirect transmission through inanimate surfaces – in particular those with
prolonged and high contact – is not unlikely, and must be considered. A source of optimism may lie
in the injurious impact of evaporating water droplets on the enveloped phage Phi6, an observation
that should be confirmed with SARS-CoV-2.

human saliva were applied onto a glass-bottom 12-well plate by a spraying device, resulting in microdroplets
ranging in size from ~10 microns to ~1 mms in diameter. Plates were transferred to sealed containers that
maintained specific RH conditions (using saturated salt solutions), and the containers were placed in an
incubator to maintain constant temperature (250C) for 14 hrs. At the end of the incubation period, the surface
of the plates was imaged by microscopy, and subsequently the wells were re-suspended and phage
concentration was determined by the plaque assay.

visualize the expected distribution of viruses within evaporated microdroplets.

and 78% RH at 250C. A 105-106 titer of bacteriophage suspended in SM buffer, H2O, or human saliva was
applied by spraying on a glass surface. A control sample was left suspended in the spraying device for the
duration of the incubation period. Following the incubation period, phage concentration was determined by
plaque assay (mean ± SD of four replicates). Right panel: Relative reduction of infectivity of Phi6, PhiX174,
and MS2 in SM buffer (green), H2O (red) and saliva (blue) (mean ± SD of four replicates).
