Abstract

21

A new coronavirus SARS-CoV-2 has caused over 9.2 million infection cases and 475758

22

deaths worldwide. Due to the rapid dissemination and the unavailability of specific

23

therapy, there is a desperate need for vaccines to combat the epidemic of SARS-CoV-2.

24

An in silico approach based on the available virus genome was applied to identify 19 high

25

immunogenic B-cell epitopes and 499 human-leukocyte-antigen (HLA) restricted T-cell

26

epitopes. Thirty multi-epitope peptide vaccines were designed by iNeo Suite, and

27

manufactured by solid-phase synthesis. Docking analysis showed stable hydrogen bonds

28

of epitopes with their corresponding HLA alleles. When four vaccine peptide candidates

29

from the spike protein of SARS-CoV-2 were selected to immunize mice, a significantly

30

larger amount of IgG in serum as well as an increase of CD19+ cells in ILNs was

31

observed in peptide-immunized mice compared to the control mice. The ratio of

32

IFN-γ-secreting lymphocytes in CD4+ or CD8+ cells in the peptides-immunized mice

33

were higher than that in the control mice. There were also a larger number of

34

IFN-γ-secreting T cells in spleen in the peptides-immunized mice. This study screened

35

antigenic B-cell and T-cell epitopes in all encoded proteins of SARS-CoV-2, and further

36

designed multi-epitope based peptide vaccine against viral structural proteins. The

37

obtained vaccine peptides successfully elicited specific humoral and cellular immune

38

responses in mice. Primate experiments and clinical trial are urgently required to validate

39

the efficacy and safety of these vaccine peptides.

(HLA) restricted T-cell epitopes, and designed a panel of multi-epitope peptide vaccines.

Introduction

54

Since December 2019, a new type of coronavirus, SARS-CoV-2 (previously named

55

2019-nCoV by the World Health Organization), has caused an outbreak of viral lung infections

56

in Wuhan City, Hubei Province, China, and later thrived over 30 countries worldwide

57

(1-4). As of 24 June 2020, there have been over 9.2 million total confirmed cases and

58

475758 deaths of SARS-CoV-2 infection in the ongoing pandemic (5). Comparisons of

59

the genome sequences of SARS-CoV-2 with other virus has shown 79.5% and 96%

60

similarities at nucleotide level to SARS-CoV and bat coronaviruses, respectively (6),

61

which suggested its probable origin in bats (7). The main clinical manifestations of

62

SARS-CoV-2 patients are fever (≥38℃), dry cough, low or normal peripheral white

63

blood cell count, and low lymphocyte count, known as novel coronavirus-infected

64

pneumonia (NCIP) or coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID19) (8).

65

Currently, there is no approved therapeutics or vaccines available for the treatment of

bioRxiv preprint doi: https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.03.03.962332; this version posted June 30, 2020. The copyright holder for this preprint

66

COVID-19 (9). Due to lack of anti-viral drugs or vaccines, control measures have been

67

relying on the rapid detection and isolation of symptomatic cases (9). In this context, a

68

safe and efficacious vaccine is urgently required. Traditional approaches for developing

69

vaccines waste much time in isolating, inactivating and injecting the microorganisms (or

70

portions of them) that cause disease. Fortunately, computation-based method enables us

71

to start from analysis of viral genome, without the need to grow pathogens and therefore

72

speeding up the entire process. Complete genome sequencing of SARS-CoV-2 has

73

finished and paved the way for the vaccine development (9). The genome of

74

SARS-CoV-2 encodes the spike protein, the membrane protein, the envelope protein, the

75

nucleocapsid protein and a few replication and transcription-related enzymes. Given the

76

lack of repairing mechanism of RNA virus replicase complex, mutations are prone to

77

occur during virus replication. The 4% nucleotide difference of the virus isolated from

78

Rhinolophus to that from human suggests that SARS-CoV-2 mutates rapidly to achieve

79

the host conversion (10). Like SARS-CoV, SARS-CoV-2 uses its receptor binding

80

domain (RBD) on the spike protein to bind to the host’s angiotensin-converting enzyme 2

81

(ACE2) (6, 9, 11, 12). The RBD of SARS-CoV-2 binds angiotensin-converting enzyme 2

82

(ACE2) with 10-20-fold higher affinity than does SARS-CoV (13). Consequently, the

83

SARS-CoV-2 vaccine can be developed targeting the structural proteins, and in particular,

84

the RBD region, following the strategy for the SARS-CoV vaccine development (11,

85

14-17).

86

An ideal vaccine may contain both B-cell epitopes and T-cell epitopes, with

87

combination of which vaccine is able to either induce specific humoral or cellular

88

immune against pathogens efficiently (18). Since the development of a peptide vaccine

bioRxiv preprint doi: https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.03.03.962332; this version posted June 30, 2020. The copyright holder for this preprint

89

against the virus causing foot-and-mouth disease (19), the establishment of peptide

90

synthesis method by Lerner et al. (20), along with the advent of a peptide vaccine design

91

combining T-cell and B-cell epitopes, has accelerated the vaccine development. In the

92

present study, we followed this in silico approach to identify the potential B-cell and

93

T-cell epitope(s) from the spike, envelope and membrane proteins. Then we selected a

94

few candidate vaccine peptides to immunize mice. As a result, these peptides successfully

95

elicited specific humoral and cellular immune responses, showing their potentials in the

96

real combat against SARS-CoV-2.

97

Materials and Methods

98

Data retrieval

99

The genome sequence of SARS-CoV-2 isolate Wuhan-Hu-1 was retrieved from the NCBI

100

database under the accession number MN908947. Gene and protein sequences were

101

acquired according to the annotation. In particular, the RBD region for the spike protein

102

was referred to as the fragment from 347 to 520 amino acid (aa) (21).

103

B-cell epitope prediction

104

The online tool in IEDB (Immune-Epitope-Database And Analysis-Resource) was used

105

for the analysis of the conserved regions of the candidate epitopes (22). Prediction of

106

linear B-cell epitopes was performed through Bepipred software (23). The antigenic sites

107

were determined with Kolaskar method (24). The surface accessible epitopes were

108

predicted by Emini tool (25).

109

T-cell epitope prediction

110

The sequences of structural proteins were split into small fragments with a length of 9aa;

111

their binding affinity with the 34 most prevalent HLA alleles was predicted using

bioRxiv preprint doi: https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.03.03.962332; this version posted June 30, 2020. The copyright holder for this preprint

112

netMHCpan (26) and our in-house prediction software iNeo-Pred, respectively.

113

iNeo-Pred was trained on a large immune-peptide dataset, and achieved a better

114

performance in predicting binding affinity of epitopes to specific HLA alleles. Only the

115

epitopes predicted by both tools were selected. Next, for each epitope, a HLA score was

116

calculated based on the frequencies of binding HLA alleles in Chinese population, which

117

will be used as metrics to select better candidates for downstream analysis.

118

Vaccine peptide design

119

The vaccine peptides were designed by our in-house tool iNeo-Design. First, the selected

120

B-cell epitopes and their adjacent T-cell epitopes were bridged to form candidate peptides

121

with length no more than 30aa. Meanwhile, to facilitate the peptide synthesis, vaccine

122

peptide sequences were optimized based on their hydrophobicity and acidity. To

123

minimize the safety risk, peptides that contained toxicity potential, human homologous

124

region (full-length matches and identity > 95%), or bioactive peptide were discarded.

125

Besides the vaccine peptides containing both B-cell epitopes and T-cell epitopes,

126

iNeo-Design also utilized all predicted T-cell epitopes to generate T-cell epitopes-only

127

vaccine peptides. For each vaccine candidate, the epitope counts and HLA score

128

reflecting the population coverage were calculated. Vaccine candidates with the higher

129

epitope counts and HLA score were considered to be preferable for the downstream

130

analysis.

131

Structural analysis

132

The online server swiss-model was used to predict the 3D protein structures of viral

133

proteins and HLA molecules (27). The online server PEP_FOLD was used to predict

134

T-cell epitopes’ structures (28). To display the interaction between T-cell epitopes and

bioRxiv preprint doi: https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.03.03.962332; this version posted June 30, 2020. The copyright holder for this preprint

135

HLA molecules, T-cell epitope models were docked to HLA molecules using MDockPep

136

(29). All predicted structures or models were decorated and displayed by the open source

137

version of pymol program (https://github.com/schrodinger/pymol-open-source).

138

Immuno-stimulation of B lymphocytes

139

The selected 4 peptides were synthesized with the solid phase synthesis method by

140

GenScript Biotech Company (Nanjing, China), and were mixed at an equal concentration

141

of 1mg/ml. The immunization experiment constituted three groups, each consisting of 12

142

6–8 week-old female C57mice. Mice were immunized subcutaneously with 100 μL of the

143

following compounds: Group 1, 100 g peptide mixture & 50 l QuickAntibody-Mouse

144

(Biodragen, Beijing, China); Group 2, 50 l QuickAntibody-Mouse; and Group 3, 100 l

145

PBS as negative control. The immunization was performed once a week and repeated

146

four times in total.

147

On the 14th, 21st, 28th day after the 1st immunization, retro-orbital blood was collected

148

from 5 randomly selected mice in each group. The sera were tested for the presence of

149

IgG by enzyme linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). Briefly, ELISA plates were coated

150

with 100 μL of S protein (2 μg/mL recombinant 2019-nCoV s-trimer protein;

151

Novoprotein, Shanghai, China). The coated plates were incubated overnight at room

152

temperature and washed with PBS containing 0.05% Tween 20 (PBS-T). Blocking buffer

153

(1% nonfat milk in PBS) was added and incubated for 2 h at 37 °C. After washing with

154

PBS-T, the diluted sera (1:1000 in PBS buffer containing 1% nonfat milk and 0.05%

155

Tween-20) were added and incubated at 37 °C for 2 h. Next the plates were washed with

156

PBS and again incubated at 37 °C for 2 h with horseradish peroxidase conjugated Goat

for 30 min at 37 °C. Finally, the reaction was stopped using stop buffer (Solarbio, Beijing,

160

China), and the absorbance was measured at 492 nm.

161

On the 28th day after the 1st immunization, 6 randomly selected mice were euthanized.

with buffer (PBS with 0.1% Tween 20), 1:100 diluted biotinylated anti-IFN-γ were added

192

and incubated for 90 min at 37°C. After each incubation step, the plates were washed

193

three times with buffer. Next, after 1 h of incubation with streptavidin-alkaline

204

Prediction of B-cell epitopes

205

During the immune response against viral infection, B-cell takes in viral epitopes to

206

recognize viruses and activates defense responses. Recognition of B-cell epitopes

207

depends on antigenicity, accessibility of surface and predictions of linear epitope (30). A

208

total of 61 B-cell epitopes were predicted, which seemed preferentially located within

209

certain regions of each gene (Figure 1; Figure 2; Table S1). Only 19 epitopes were

210

exposed on the surface of the virion and had a high antigenicity score, indicating their

211

potentials in initiating immune response. Therefore, they were considered to be promising

212

vaccine candidates against B-cells. Among the 19 epitopes, 17 were longer than 14

213

residues and located in the spike protein that contained RBD and functioned in host cell

214

binding (Table 1). The average Emini score for the 19 epitopes was 2.744, and the

215

average for Kolaskar (antigenicity) score was 1.015. Two epitopes were located within

216

the RBD region, while the one with the highest Kolaskar score (1.059),

217

1052-FPQSAPH-1058, was located at position 1052aa of the spike protein.

218

Prediction of T-cell epitopes

219

The immune response of T-cell is considered as a long lasting response compared to

220

B-cell where the antigen might easily escape the antibody memory response (31).

221

Moreover, the CD8+ T and CD4+ T-cell responses play a major role in antiviral immunity.

222

It is therefore important to design vaccines that can induce T-cell's immune response (32).

223

A total of 499 T-cell epitopes were predicted on the spike protein (378 epitopes), the

224

membrane protein (90 epitopes) and the envelop protein (31 epitopes); 48 of the 378

225

epitopes for the spike protein were located in the RBD region (Figure 1; Table 2; Table

226

S2). There is no preference in certain genes or regions for T-cell epitope generation; no

227

biased distribution of T-cell epitopes among HLA types was observed either. Among all

228

T-cell epitopes, the epitope 869-MIAQYTSAL-877 in the spike protein was predicted to

229

be able to bind to 17 HLA alleles. Most of the HLA alleles included in the present study

230

were covered by these vaccine candidates, which suggested a wide population coverage.

231

In terms of the distribution of the predicted epitopes against different HLA

232

haplotypes, no significant differences were observed among different HLA haplotypes

233

(Table S3). There were 287, 208 and 195 epitopes predicted to be able to bind to HLA-A,

234

HLA-B and HLA-C haplotypes, respectively. For the most popular five HLA types

235

(HLA-A*11:01, HLA-A*24:02, HLA-C*07:02, HLA-A*02:01 and HLA-B*46:01), the

236

counts for epitopes with binding affinity were 51, 49, 115, 48 and 58.

237

Multi-epitope vaccine design

238

Based on the 19 B-cell epitopes and their 121 adjacent T-cell epitopes, 17 candidate

239

vaccine peptides that contained both B-cell and T-cell epitopes were generated by our

240

in-house software iNeo-Design. Most of the 17 candidate vaccine peptides contained one

241

B-cell epitopes, except for AVEQDKNTQEVFAQVKQIYKTPPIKDFGG, which

242

involved

243

AKNLNESLIDLQELGKYEQYIKWPWYIWKK, which contained two B-cell epitopes

244

and

245

FKNLREFVFKNIDGYFKIYSKHTPINLV had the largest count of T-cell epitopes,

246

whereas the vaccine peptide SYGFQPTNGVGYQPYRVVVLSFELLHAPAT showed the

highest HLA score, indicating their wide population coverage and promising efficacy.

250

containing T-cell epitopes only. Based on both the epitope counts and HLA score, we

251

eventually selected 13 T-cell epitopes-only vaccine peptides.

252

Taken together, a total of 30 peptide vaccine candidates were designed (Table 3). 26

253

of them were from the spike protein, two from the membrane protein and two from the

254

envelope protein. Five peptides were located in the RBD region, indicating they were

255

likely to induce the production of neutralizing antibody. The 30 vaccine peptides covered

256

all structural proteins that may induce immune response against SARS-CoV-2 in theory;

257

and the multi-peptide strategy we applied would better fit the genetic variability of the

258

human immune system and reduce the risk of pathogen’s escape through mutation (33).

259

Interaction of predicted peptides with HLA alleles

To further inspect the binding stability of T-cell epitopes against HLA alleles, the T-cell

261

epitopes involved in the above designed vaccine peptides were selected to conduct an

262

interaction analysis. Figure 3 illustrated the docking results against the most popular HLA

263

types for the two epitopes from vaccines peptide 25 and 27 (Table 3; Table 4), which

264

showed relatively higher HLA score. The MDockPep scores were between -148 ~ -136,

265

indicating that the predicted crystal structures were stable. All epitopes were docked

266

inside the catalytic pocket of the receptor protein. In particular, the epitope

267

1220-FIAGLIAIV-1228 from the spike protein possessed 2-5 stable hydrogen bonds with

268

the HLA alleles; the epitope 4-FVSEETGTL-12 from the envelop protein possessed 4~5

269

stable hydrogen bonds (Table 4). Taken together, the epitopes included in our vaccine

270

peptides can interact with the given HLA alleles by in silico prediction.

271

Humoral immune responses to SARS-CoV-2 S protein

272

Based on the above immunoinformatics analysis, 4 designed vaccine peptides, namely P9,

273

P12, P14 and P15, were chosen as the candidates for the downstream validation

274

experiments because of their relatively higher counts of B-cell and T-cell epitopes and the

275

higher frequencies of their epitopes’ corresponding HLA alleles (Table 3). We immunized

276

mice by subcutaneous injection of the mixture of these synthesized peptides plus

277

QuickAntibody (an adjuvant for stimulating B cells). Mice injected with QuickAntibody

278

only or PBS were studied as controls. The immunization was performed once a week and

279

repeated four times in total.

280

To evaluate whether these peptides induce B cells to produce specific antibody

281

against the S protein, an ELISA assay was conducted to detect IgG in the sera of mice.

282

Fourteen days after the 1st immunization, the amount of IgG showed little difference

283

between the peptide-treated mice and the controls (Figure 4a), suggesting that two weeks

284

were not long enough to elicit humoral immune response. Since the 21st day after the 1st

285

immunization, however, the expression of IgG had risen to the plateau in the

286

peptide-treated mice and was remarkably higher than that in the control mice (p<0.05;

287

Figure 4a). Germinal centers (GCs) are the main sites for the production of high-affinity,

288

long-lived plasma cells and memory B cells. On the 28th day after the 1st immunization,

289

we collected ILN and stained cells with antibody of GL7 and FAS. Flow cytometry

290

showed that there were much more B cells activated in the peptides-treated mice than in

291

the mice injected with adjuvant only (Figure 4b); and the numbers of rapidly proliferated

292

B cells (CD19+/FAS+/GL7+) from GC in ILNs of the peptides-treated mice were

293

significantly higher than that in the control groups, demonstrating that there were

294

increased GCs induced by peptide vaccines (Figure 4c-d). In future, a viral neutralization

295

study is further required for demonstrating that the designed peptide vaccines can

296

efficiently activate specific humoral immune responses to the S protein of SARS-CoV-2.

297

Cellular immune responses to SARS-CoV-2 S protein

298

In parallel, we also immunized mice with peptides plus GM-CSF, an adjuvant that

299

induced the development of monocytes, neutrophils and dendritic cells. Mice injected

300

with GM-CSF only or PBS were used as controls. On both the 14th and the 28th day after

301

the 1st immunization, the ILNs were collected. We found that the ratios of

302

IFN-γ-secreting cells to both CD4+ and CD8+ T cells in the peptides-treated mice were

303

significantly higher than that in the control groups (Figure 5), suggesting the activation of

304

T cells by the peptide vaccines. Notably, the ratio of IFN-γ-secreting cells seemed to

305

reach its plateau on the 14th day, since no further significant increase of this ratio was

306

observed on the 28th day. It was likely that, in the absence of the virus, the repeated T cell

307

stimulation led to depletion or transfer of T cells in ILNs; accordingly, the ratio of

308

IFN-γ-secreting cells in the ILNs kept relatively stable afterwards.

309

We also quantified the peptide specific lymphocytes in mice spleen on the 28th day

310

using the enzyme-linked immunospot (ELISPOT) assay of IFN-γ secreting. In terms of

311

either the ratio of IFN-γ-secreting lymphocytes in splenocytes or the total number of

312

IFN-γ-secreting lymphocytes in spleen, mice immunized with peptide vaccines had

313

significantly higher ratios than that in the control groups. This finding was overall

314

consistent with the flow cytometry results of ILN cells, suggesting that the lymphocytes

315

were activated and might recirculate to gather in the spleen after 4-week vaccination.

Discussion

318

Since the outbreak of COVID-19, numerous researchers have contributed in the

bioRxiv preprint doi: https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.03.03.962332; this version posted June 30, 2020. The copyright holder for this preprint

319

development of safe and effective vaccines for COVID-19 to increase the chances of

320

success. Meanwhile, World Health Organization (WHO) has encouraged scientists to test

321

all candidate vaccines until they fail. Currently, the developing candidate vaccines

322

include inactivated virus vaccine, recombinant protein vaccine, viral vector vaccine,

323

peptide vaccine, DNA and RNA vaccines.

324

In comparison, the involvement of the optimization of cell and virus culture process

325

increase the complexity and thus preparation time of inactivated virus vaccine and viral

326

vector vaccine. Also, for the development of inactivated virus vaccine, besides Good

327

Manufacturing Practices (GMP) system, extremely high manufacture standard is required

328

to avoid medical accidents due to the failure of complete inactivation of virus toxicity.

329

Differently, the development of our peptide vaccine is much simpler, including only two

330

major steps: sequence design through reverse vaccinology approach, and peptide

331

synthesis.

332

Until now, most recombinant protein vaccine candidates have focused on spike protein,

333

which although can provide good safety, is probably unable to stimulate strong T cell

334

immune response (34). Therefore, effective adjuvants are usually added when use this

335

kind of vaccines. Similar to recombinant protein vaccines, most viral vector vaccine

336

candidates are based on the expression of spike protein (35). Although the application of

337

viral vector could enhance the vaccine’s delivery efficiency, the body’s immune response

338

to vector itself might interfere with the immune response to target epitopes, and thus

339

compromise the efficacy of this kind of vaccines. Unlike the vaccine candidates discussed

340

above, our peptide vaccine candidate is composed of 30 peptides from not only spike

341

protein, but also membrane protein and envelope protein of SARS-CoV-2, containing

bioRxiv preprint doi: https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.03.03.962332; this version posted June 30, 2020. The copyright holder for this preprint

342

both B-cell epitopes and T-cell epitopes to induce specific humoral and cellular immune

343

response against SARS-CoV-2 more efficiently.

344

On the other hand, although promising in preclinical or Phase I and II clinical trials, no

345

mRNA vaccine has been formally approved by FDA (36). In other words, more clinical

346

trials should be conducted to prove the efficacy of mRNA vaccines. Moreover, the batch

347

production, manufacturing process, and industrial expansion of mRNA vaccines are still

348

under exploration. For DNA vaccines, besides the same concerns for mRNA vaccines, the

349

possibility of the integration of foreign DNA sequence to human genome has brought

350

uncertainty in their development. Different from these nucleic acid vaccines, peptide

351

vaccine has relatively more mature manufacturing process. And the successful launch of

352

previous peptide vaccines has already demonstrated the safety and efficacy of

353

peptide-based vaccines.

354

In this study, our SARS-CoV-2 multi-epitope peptide vaccine could elicit specific

355

humoral and cellular immune responses in mice, displaying its great potential in the fight

356

of COVID-19. In future, more experiments will be conducted to validate the efficacy of

357

our SARS-CoV-2 peptide vaccine.
