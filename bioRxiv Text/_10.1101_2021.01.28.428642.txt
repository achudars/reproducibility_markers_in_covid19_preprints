Relationship of COVID-19 and immunity is complex and can involve
autoimmune reactions through molecular mimicry. We investigated
autoimmunity related pathological mechanisms involving molecular mimicry that
are common to certain coronaviruses, including SARS-CoV-2, by means of a
selected peptide sequence (CFLGYFCTCYFGLFC). Accordingly, coronavirusassociated sequences that are homologous to that 15mer sequence in the SARSCoV-2 proteome are attained first. Then, homologous human and coronavirus
sequences are obtained, wherein the coronavirus sequences are homologous to
the 15mer SARS-CoV-2 peptide. All the identified query-subject sequences
contained at least 7 residue matches in the aligned regions. Finally, parts of those
coronavirus and host sequences, which are predicted to have high affinity to the
same human leukocyte antigen (HLA) alleles as that of the SARS-CoV-2
sequence, are selected among the query and subject epitope-pairs that were both
(predicted to be) strongly binding to the same HLA alleles. The proteins or the
protein regions with those predicted epitopes include, but not limited to,
immunoglobulin heavy chain junction regions, phospholipid phosphatase-related
protein type 2, slit homolog 2 protein, and CRB1 isoform I precursor. These
proteins are potentially associated with certain pathologies, but especially the
possible CRB1 related coronavirus pathogenicity could be furthered by
autoimmunity risk in HLA*A24:02 serotypes. Overall, results imply
autoimmunity risk in COVID-19 patients with HLA*A02:01 and HLA*A24:02
serotypes in general, through molecular mimicry. This is also common to other
coronaviruses than SARS-CoV-2. These results are indicative at the current
stage, they need to be validated. Yet, they can pave the way to autoimmunity
treatment options to be used in COVID-19 and its associated diseases.

Introduction
Upon infection, presence of similar sequences to the pathogens' proteins in the human
proteome can be a potential risk of causing autoimmune response. This molecular
mimicry is among the preliminary conditions. Kerkar and Vergani [1] mentioned
molecular mimicry, sequence similarities of pathogenic organisms with autoantigens, as
a possible mechanism of autoimmunity, and is conceptually reinforced through the
discoveries of de novo autoimmune hepatitis associated with certain viral infections. In
90s, a sequence similarity search revealed 70 % overlap of a 10mer within the V3-loop
of the envelope glycoprotein gp120 of HIV-1 isolates, with the collagen-like region of
the human complement component C1q-A [2]. Follow-up studies by the same group
addressed the complications that would be caused by vaccines, which are based on
gp120 of HIV-1 [3]. Later, their findings on the presence of antibodies that are reactive
for the peptide in the V3-loop of HIV-1 in the healthy individuals [4], and the
complementarity of the antibodies for V3-loop of HIV-1 and IgG of human [5] were
reported. Presence of homologies between human proteins and virus proteins, and the
examination of the pathways of those homologous peptides, drew attention to the
pathologies of viral infections that are related to the immune response [6]. Even
therapies targeting such complexifications were suggested. In correlation with these,
Kanduc and Shoenfeld [7] considered the intrinsic hazards in the vaccines that are based
on such pathogen sequences. These authors [8] later added onto their earlier findings by
looking for pentapeptide sharing between the viral, bacterial, protozoan pathogens, and
human. There, it was suggested that the respective results could elucidate the decadesold "original antigenic sin" phenomenon. Further, "negative selection of self-reactive
lymphocytes" was concluded to be unlikely, in a later study of the researchers [9].
Similarities among the SARS-CoV-spike glycoprotein sequences and those of the
human surfactant protein and the related proteins were revealed by similar methodology
[10]. Specifically, 13 of 24 shared pentapeptides were found to be present in 52 SARSCoV-derived immunoreactive epitopes. In addition, heptapeptide-sharing among
pathogens, which are also containing SARS-CoV-2, and the non-human primates, was
observed and it revealed that high level of peptide-sharing is somewhat unique to
human [11]. Among the other animals that are used for preclinical tests, mice would
more expectedly reveal autoimmune reactions. Eventually, "aged mice" was suggested
to be appropriate for testing of vaccines, which are based on spike glycoproteins of
SARS-CoV-2 [12].
In case of rheumatoid arthritis, patients expressing HLA DRB1*04:01 are more
frequently experiencing severe form of the disease, and there is a 5mer peptide of HLA
DRB1*04:01 that is also present in the heat shock protein of E. coli [13]. It is suggested
to be a risk factor upon being exposed to Enterobacteriaceae, for patients with
rheumatoid arthritis, who are expressing HLA DRB1*04:01. There are other examples,
e.g.: In systemic lupus erythematosus, a 7mer peptide region of Epstein–Barr virus
nuclear antigen 1 has cross-reactivity with an 8mer region of Sm [14]. In systemic
sclerosis, a 12mer peptide has homology with the human cytomegalovirus late protein

UL94, and it reacts with the IgG of patients [15]. In primary biliary cholangitis, E2
component of the pyruvate dehydrogenase complexes of human and E. coli have similar
regions at a peptide of the human protein that is 31 amino acids (aa) in length [16].
Relationship of COVID-19 and immunity is complex [17–22] and it can involve
autoimmune reactions through molecular mimicry. Woodruff et al. [23] recently
reported that critically ill patients of COVID-19 "displayed hallmarks of extrafollicular
B cell activation as previously described in autoimmune settings." Rodríguez and coworkers [24] recently reviewed autoinflammatory and autoimmune conditions in
COVID-19. Accordingly, antiphospholipid syndrome, autoimmune cytopenia, GuillainBarré syndrome and Kawasaki disease are known to be reported in COVID-19 patients
[24]. Regarding molecular mimicry, Cappello and co-workers [25] hypothesized that
SARS-CoV-2 may be generating autoimmunity through molecular mimicry, induced by
stress. Rodríguez and co-workers [24] mentioned the molecular mimicry and bystander
activation as the mechanisms that can link COVID-19 to autoimmunity. In relation,
Lucchese and Flöel [26] reported three 6mers in the human brainstem respiratory
pacemaker proteins that are present in the SARS-CoV-2 proteome. These authors also
reported molecular mimicry with SARS-CoV-2 and heat shock proteins 90 and 60 of
human, which are known to be associated with Guillain-Barré syndrome and other
autoimmune diseases [27]. Importantly, the shared peptides are part of those epitopes
that were experimentally shown to be immunoreactive. Also, one of the works that is
mentioned above [10] reported 5mers of human surfactant protein to be present in the
SARS-CoV-2 proteome. Angileri and co-workers [28] reported a 7mer of human
Odorant Receptor 7D4, a 6mer of human Poly ADP-Ribose Polymerase Family
Member 9, and a 7mer of Solute Carrier Family 12 Member 6, which are present in the
putative epitopes of SARS-CoV-2. There are also human proteins that have strong
immune cross-reactions with the spike protein antibody of SARS-CoV-2 [29], which
can be suggestive of autoimmunity by means of molecular mimicry in susceptible
individuals [24]. In relation, aim of the current study is to look for autoimmunity
related pathological mechanisms that are common to certain coronaviruses, including
SARS-CoV-2, by means of a selected sequence (CFLGYFCTCYFGLFC), which is
obtained through our ongoing study [30] involving tblastx search of SARS-CoV-2 and
plasmodium species that cause malaria in human [31,32].
Methods
The CFLGYFCTCYFGLFC sequence was obtained by performing blastx [33] at NCBI
[34], between the reference genome of query input SARS-CoV-2 (NC_045512.2) and
P. vivax (taxid:5855) [30]. It was the aligned query sequence in the tblastx output that
revealed the top identity between the query and subject, which was afterwards utilized
as input for NCBI blastp search, by limiting the search to SARS-CoV-2
(taxid:2697049), to ensure that the sequence is expressed [30]. Here, in this study, blast
of the sequence is performed at Uniprot with threshold 10 (performed on 5 August
2020). The associated coronaviruses with homologous sequences are selected from the

results. Then, blastp of the SARS-CoV-2 sequence and the coronavirus sequences that
are homologous, are performed separately, by limiting the searches to H. sapiens
(taxid:9606). The query-subject sequence pairs that have at least 7 residue matches are
found in those results. Within those results, the ones with the same names and sequence
IDs as those in the respective results of SARS-CoV-2 blastp search, are identified. This
is followed by major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class I binding predictions for
those identified query-subject sequence pairs. This is done to find the coronavirus and
human sequences that are homologous, and which are predicted to bind strongly to the
same HLA alleles as that with the SARS-CoV-2 sequence. To do that, binding
affinities to the MHC class I (MHC class I genes are human leukocyte antigen A [HLAA], -B, and -C genes [35]) proteins are predicted with the use of a tool that integrates
NetMHC 4.0 [36,37], NetMHCpan 4.1 [38], and PickPocket 1.1 [39]. That tool is
NetMHCcons 1.1 [40]. Predictions are performed for 8-15mers, with default
parameters, and by performing the predictions for 12 MHC supertype representatives.
The 12 MHC supertype representatives are HLA*A01:01 (A1), HLA*A02:01 (A2),
HLA*A03:01 (A3), HLA*A24:02 (A24), HLA*A26:01 (A26), HLA*B07:02 (B7),
HLA*B08:01 (B8), HLA*B27:05 (B27), HLA*B39:01 (B39), HLA*B40:01 (B44),
HLA*B58:01 (B58), HLA*B15:01 (B62). NetCTLpan 1.1 [41] is utilized as well,
similarly, for the prediction of the epitopes of cytotoxic T lymphocyte (CTL), as 811mers. Within the prediction results, epitopes with at least 5 residue matches and
strong binding affinities to the same MHC supertype representative are considered for
possible risk of autoimmunity-related pathological mechanisms that are common to
SARS-CoV-2 and associated coronaviruses, based on similarity to the selected short
SARS-CoV-2 sequence. Epitope-pairs with the highest number of residue-matches are
displayed.
Summary information about the identified proteins (or peptides in case of
immunoglobulin heavy chain junction regions) is collected by searching the sequence
ID of the aligned subject sequence in the blastp results at Entrez (NCBI), and then
searching the encoding gene ID, which is indicated at the UniProt (www.uniprot.org)
[42], to retrieve the UniProtKB number. Information on the associated diseases is
obtained from the human gene database GeneCards (www.genecards.org) [43],
wherever readily available.
Results
The query peptide with the sequence CFLGYFCTCYFGLFC in the single letter code
representation is the outcome of initial tblastx search (see s2 file of [30]). Peptide with
that sequence is present in the SARS-CoV-2 proteome (see s6 file of [30]), as part of
non-structural protein 6 (nsp6) that is cleaved from the replicase polyprotein 1a. Blast
search of the sequence is performed at Uniprot with threshold 10 (s1, performed on 5
August 2020). The associated coronaviruses are retrieved from that search and they are
shown in Table 1, with their related sequences.

Blastp search results of the sequences that are displayed in the first column of
Table 1 are obtained by limiting the search to H. sapiens (s2-10). The query-subject
sequence pairs in those results, which have at least 7 residue matches, are found (s11,
file displays the respective subject sequences and the proteins containing them).
Among those, the ones with the same protein name and sequence IDs as those in the
respective results of SARS-CoV-2 blastp, are identified (Table 2). The
LGFMCTCYFGVF sequence that is displayed at Table 1 do not have any alignment
with the same protein name and sequence ID as those that are aligned with the SARSCoV-2 sequence. The GWFCTCYFGLY sequence that is displayed at Table 1 do not
have any alignment with the same protein name and sequence ID as neither those that
are aligned with the SARS-CoV-2 sequence nor the others. Yet, it should be reminded
that we looked for at least 7 residue matches, which indicates that the outcome could be
different with 6 residue matches, for instance.

aQuery

It is observed at Table 2 that there are 24 different alignments of 16 human
protein sequences, with the coronavirus sequences, which contains the
CFLGYFCTCYFGLFC sequence (query seq-1, the SARS-CoV-2 sequence) or those
homologous to that sequence. So, all the listed proteins in Table 2 are aligning with the
query seq-1, which is a SARS-CoV-2 sequence, and with at least one other coronavirus
sequence that is homologous to the query seq-1. Briefly, Table 2 presents the
alignments of CFLGYFCTCYFGLFC as query seq-1, with the human proteins, and
those alignments are common to the respective sequences of other coronaviruses, which
are homologous to the 15mer SARS-CoV-2 sequence (query seq-1). Finally, Table 3
presents the MHC supertype representative-binding predictions for the coronavirus
(query) and human (subject) sequence pairs, which are predicted to bind strongly to the
same HLA alleles, not only with each other but also with those of the SARS-CoV-2.
Namely, MHC supertype representative-binding predictions are performed for (both the
query and subject) sequences that are informed at Table 2. Those that are predicted to
bind strongly to the same HLA alleles with each other and at the same time, with the
query and subject sequences of SARS-CoV-2, are displayed in Table 3.
Immunoglobulin heavy chain junction regions with sequence IDs MOR79299.1,
MOR77883.1, and MON20268.1; immunoglobulin heavy chain variable regions with
sequence IDs ACT68971.1 and AAK13839.1; and metabotropic glutamate receptor 5
isoform with sequence ID EAW59359.1 are present in Table 2, but not displayed in
Table 3. The query-subject sequence pairs of those protein sequences are not predicted
to bind strongly to the same HLA alleles. On the other hand, immunoglobulin heavy
chain variable region with the sequence ID CEF94348.1 is also absent in Table 3
because query-subject sequence pairs of those other than those of the SARS-CoV-2 are
not predicted to bind strongly to the same HLA alleles there. Here, it is reminded that
the query-subject sequence pairs that are predicted to bind strongly to the same HLA
alleles with each other but not with that of the SARS-CoV-2 sequence are not displayed

in Table 3 and prediction results with weak binding affinities are also not considered,
which may have eliminated some potentially significant results.
The predictions that are presented in Table 3 belong to NetMHCcons, but
predictions are performed by using NetCTLpan as well. NetCTLpan made similar
predictions for those that have presumably high affinity to the HLA*A24:02 allele,
according to NetMHCcons. The exceptions are the predictions for the alignments of
query seq-2 (CFLGYCCCCYFGLFC) with hCG1995581 (sequence ID EAW57092.1),
predictions for the alignments of both query seq-1 and seq-2 with the slit homolog 2

the immunoglobulin heavy chain junction region (sequence ID MCG41834.1).

if they are among the matching-residues in the original alignments. Those residues are further
underlined if they are still present as matching-residues in the predicted epitope-pairs. HLA
allele is indicated in the first column. Accordingly, the same HLA allele is displayed in case of
the coronavirus (query) and human (subject) epitope-pairs. Epitopes predicted by NetMHCcons
are displayed here. Epitope-pairs that are sourced by the alignments of the SARS-CoV-2 15mer
(query seq-1) are shown in the third column. In the second column, 1 indicates the SARS-CoV2 (query) sequence-number and it is written at the rows, which correspond to the same rows as
the SARS-CoV-2 (query) epitopes of the epitope-pairs at the third column. Epitope-pairs that
are sourced by the alignments of the other coronavirus sequences are shown in the fifth column.
The numbers in the fourth column indicates the other coronaviruses’ (queries’) sequencenumbers and they are written at the rows, which correspond to the same rows as the respective
coronaviruses’ (queries’) epitopes of the epitope-pairs at the fifth column. Names of the human
proteins with the aligned subject sequences are displayed at the last column.

bQuery

It is observed in Table 3 that the predicted epitope-pairs, which include peptides
that are sourced by two immunoglobulin heavy chain junction regions (sequence IDs
MOQ87140.1 and MOP50498.1) and phospholipid phosphatase-related protein type 2
isoform (sequence ID XP_024307423.1), bind strongly to the HLA*A02:01 (A2) allele.
On the other hand, those that include peptides that are sourced by hCG1995581
(sequence ID EAW57092.1), two other immunoglobulin heavy chain junction regions
(sequence IDs MON95290.1 and MCG41834.1), hCG2028737 (sequence ID
EAW73174.1), CRB1 isoform I precursor (sequence ID AAL10681.1) and slit homolog
2 protein isoform (sequence ID XP_011512212.2), bind strongly to the HLA*A24:02
(A24) allele. Peptides of most of these proteins that overlap with the SARS-CoV-2
peptide’s sequence (seq-1) overlap with the CFLGYCCCCYFGLFC sequence (seq-2)
as well. This is expected since CFLGYCCCCYFGLFC (seq-2) is closer to the SARSCoV-2 peptide (seq-1), compared to the other sequences (Figure 1). Yet, the CRB1
isoform I precursor is the protein that is containing an antigenic, similar peptide to the
highest number of different coronavirus sequences (query seq-3 to -6) that are
homologous to the SARS-CoV-2 15mer (query seq-1) (Table 3). This makes the
epitope, which is part of the CRB1 isoform I precursor, a strong candidate of a common
mechanism of autoimmune reaction risk in the individuals with the HLA*A24:02
serotype, sourced by SARS-CoV-2 and other coronaviruses. CRB1 related coronavirus
pathogenicity is already suggested [45,46]. Here, it is suggested that possible CRB1
related coronavirus pathogenicity is additionally furthered by autoimmunity risk in
certain individuals.

Discussion
Bianchi and co-workers [47] indicated in their paper that studies involving peptide elution
confirmed the presentation of transmembrane helices by the MHC class I molecules. In
accordance, CFLGYFCTCYFGLFC is also likely a transmembrane region, and is predicted as a
strong binder to certain HLA alleles, in the same manner as its homologous sequences in the
human proteome [48]. In this study, its subset that is common to other coronaviruses, which have
a peptide sequence that is homologous to CFLGYFCTCYFGLFC, is found (Table 3). Some
associated diseases of the proteins with the aligned peptides as potential epitopes are already
mentioned in the “summary information.” In relation to this study, Lyons-Weiler [49] identified
13

immunogenic epitopes that are present in the proteome of SARS-CoV-2. They then compared
those epitopes with the proteome of human. More than 1/3 of peptides that are immunogenic
were found to be homologous to the proteins that are significant in the adaptive immune system.
Kanduc [50] suggested that there is an extensive range of health disorders, related to probable
autoimmunity reactions against peptides of the human proteome, which have homology with the
immunogenic peptides of SARS-CoV-2. Also, it was indicated in another study [51] that
cerebrospinal fluids from the patients of COVID-19 were suggestive of autoimmunity. In line
with those studies, the results presented here suggest autoimmunity risk in COVID-19 patients
with HLA*A02:01 and HLA*A24:02 serotypes, by means of molecular mimicry, as a common
risk to their exposure to the other coronaviruses. This is because immune responses to the
peptides and proteins with similar sequences and strong binding affinities to the same HLA allele
can lead to autoimmune responses [52–58]. Yet, Trost and co-workers [55] pointed at
dramatically high number of common heptapeptides (7mers) between bacterial and human
proteomes. In relation, Amela and co-workers [59] demonstrated that most of the pathogen
proteins that can cause antibody generation by the host immune system are not homologous to the
human proteins and vice versa. Distinguishing self from non-self was suggested to be one
contributing mechanism [60]. In addition, there need to be genetic, physiological, and
environmental [13] variations in action. Besides, studies are generally performed or initiated by
analysing the reference genomes, but individual genetic variations in the identified sequences
could well influence the outcomes in real, including those for the vaccines [61]. For evaluation,
it is offered that the detection of cross-reacting T-cells or antibodies, epidemiological connection
between exposures to or possessing the risk factors and following development of autoimmune
disease, and duplicability of the conditions in animal model(s), are the needed proofs, in addition
to the presence of similarity. Autoimmune reactions were shown to be developed in the animal
models under such conditions (e.g. [62,63]). Yet, the last two criteria of those are challenging,
and besides, not free from concerns [13].
Involvement of evolutionary processes [64] is a related concern, not only to these
discussions but also to this study and its results. Vaccine targets are already studied for COVID19 [65], but cross-reactivity risk in the adjuvant-vaccine for the individuals with genetic
susceptibility should also be considered [61], together with the discussed considerations in terms
of the autoimmunity risk, in general. Similar studies as those mentioned here [7–12,49,50] need
to be performed, maybe even by taking possible variations in the genetic makeup into account.
In the end, we would like to remind once more the useful suggestion of implementing HLA
typing into COVID-19 tests and clinical trials [35], and the considerations about tests on the
animals [11].
It is observed here that the epitope, which is part of the CRB1 isoform I precursor, is the
candidate of a common mechanism of coronavirus-sourced risk of autoimmune reaction in the
individuals with the HLA*A24:02 serotype. Interestingly, Warren and Birol [66] identified the
same allele in predictions from the transcriptome sequences of bronchoalveolar lavage fluid of 4
14

among 5 COVID-19 patients from China. Differently, this allele was reported by the authors as
not (recognised as) a SARS-risk-factor. On the other hand, only the query-subject sequence pairs
that are predicted to bind strongly to the same HLA alleles with each other and with that of the
SARS-CoV-2 sequence are considered here and prediction results with weak binding affinities
are eliminated. This may have diminished the number of results here. Also, current study
involves one SARS-CoV-2 peptide and performing a similar study with the whole proteome of
the virus will be providing a much comprehensive view.
Conclusion
We investigated autoimmunity related common pathological mechanisms of coronaviruses,
through a 15mer peptide of SARs-CoV-2 with the sequence CFLGYFCTCYFGLFC, in one letter
code. For that, coronavirus sequences homologous to the SARS-CoV-2 peptide are initially
obtained. Afterwards, we identified those homologous coronavirus sequences that are aligning
with the human proteins with at least 7 residue matches, which are common to the alignments of
the SARS-CoV-2 15mer with the human protein sequences, in a similar fashion. So, coronavirus
(query) and human (subject) epitope-pairs are identified. Those epitope-pairs are the ones that
are predicted to bind strongly to the same HLA alleles, not only with each other but also with that
of the SARS-CoV-2 15mer and its aligned sequence in the same human protein.
Immunoglobulin heavy chain junction regions, phospholipid phosphatase-related protein type 2,
CRB1 isoform I precursor, and slit homolog 2 protein are among the proteins with those
predicted epitopes. They can be related to pathological conditions. Particularly the probable
coronavirus pathogenicity related to CRB1 is suggested to be promoted by autoimmunity risk in
the individuals with the HLA*A24:02 serotypes. Overall, the results infer autoimmunity risk in
COVID-19 individuals with HLA*A02:01 and HLA*A24:02 serotypes, in general, by means of
molecular mimicry. Further, it is common to other coronaviruses. This is based on their
homology to the SARS-CoV-2 15mer, and their aligning with the same human proteins as those
that are aligning with the SARS-CoV-2 15mer, and their binding affinity predictions, which are
revealed to be strong for the same HLA alleles. These findings can pave the way to clinical
studies for autoimmunity treatment options to be used in COVID-19 and associated diseases.
