Phylogenetic Analysis of SARS-CoV-2 Genomes in Turkey

Abstract: COVID-19 has effectively spread worldwide. As of May 2020, Turkey is

4

among the top ten countries with the most cases. A comprehensive genomic

5

characterization of the virus isolates in Turkey is yet to be carried out. Here, we built a

6

phylogenetic tree with globally obtained 15,277 severe acute respiratory syndrome

7

coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) genomes. We identified the subtypes based on the

8

phylogenetic clustering in comparison with the previously annotated classifications. We

9

performed a phylogenetic analysis of the first thirty SARS-CoV-2 genomes isolated and

10

sequenced in Turkey. We suggest that the first introduction of the virus to the country is

11

earlier than the first reported case of infection. Virus genomes isolated from Turkey are

12

dispersed among most types in the phylogenetic tree. We find two of the seventeen sub-

13

clusters enriched with the isolates of Turkey, which likely have spread expansively in the

14

country. Finally, we traced virus genomes based on their phylogenetic placements. This

15

analysis suggested multiple independent international introductions of the virus and

16

revealed a hub for the inland transmission. We released a web application to track the

17

global and interprovincial virus spread of the isolates from Turkey in comparison to

18

thousands of genomes worldwide.

Introduction

22

Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) has emerged in Wuhan

23

(Li, et al. 2020), spread across continents and eventually resulted in the COVID-19

24

pandemic. Although there are significant differences between the current and previously

25

known SARS-CoV genomes, the reason behind it’s pandemic behaviour is still unclear.

26

Genome sequences around the world were revealed and deposited into public databases

27

such as GISAID (Shu and McCauley 2017). With those genomic datasets, it is possible,

28

in fact crucial to reveal the evolutionary events of SARS-CoV-2 to understand the types

29

of the circulating genomes as well as in which parts of the genome differ across these

30

types.

31
32

The SARS-CoV-2 virus is homologous to SARS-CoV, and its closer versions were

33

characterized in bats and pangolins (Li, et al. 2020). The virus has been under a strong

34

purifying selection (Li, et al. 2020). With the isolates obtained so far, the sequences of

35

SARS-CoV-2 genomes showed more than 99.9% percent identity indicating a recent shift

36

to the human species (Tang, et al. 2020). Yet, there are unambiguous evolutionary clusters

37

in the genome pool. Various studies use SNP (Tang, et al. 2020) or entropy (Zhao, et al.

38

2020) based methods to identify evolving virus types to reveal genomic regions

39

responsible for transmission and evolution. Tang et. al identified S and L types among

40

103 SARS-CoV-2 genomes based on two SNPs at ORF1ab and ORF8 regions which

41

encode replicase/transcriptase and ATF6, respectively (Tang, et al. 2020). The entropy-

42

based approach generated informative subtype markers from 17 informative positions to

43

cluster evolving virus genomes (Zhao, et al. 2020). Another study defined a competitive

44

subtype based on the D614G mutation in the spike protein which facilitates binding to

45

ACE2 to receptor on the host cell surface (Bhattacharyya, et al. 2020). Although whether

46

there is any effect of D614G substitution on the transmissibility is inconclusive (van

47

Dorp, et al. 2020), this mutation has been one of the landmarks for major groupings of

48

the virus family.

49
50

In this work, we used publicly available SARS-CoV-2 genome datasets. We aligned the

51

sequences of more than 15,000 whole genomes and built a phylogenetic tree with the

52

maximum likelihood method. We clustered the genomes based on their clade distribution

53

in the phylogenetic tree, identified their genomic characteristics and linked them with the

54

previous studies. We further analysed clusters, mutations and transmission patterns of the

55

genomes from Turkey.

Materials and methods

58

To perform our analyses we retrieved virus genomes, aligned them to each other and

59

revealed the evolutionary relationships between them through phylogenetic trees. We

60

assigned the clusters based on the mutations for each genome. We further analyzed the

61

phylogenetic tree with respect to neighbor samples of our genomes of interest to identify

62

possible transmission patterns.

65

The entire SARS-CoV-2 genome sequences, along with their metadata were retrieved

66

from the GISAID database (Table-S1) (Shu and McCauley 2017). We retrieved the

67

initial batch of genomes (3,228) from GISAID on 02/04/2020. We used Augur toolkit to

68

align whole genome sequences using mafft algorithm (--reorder --anysymbol –

nomemsave) (Katoh and Standley 2016). The SARS-CoV2 isolate Wuhan-Hu-1

70

genome (GenBank:NC_045512.2) was used as a reference genome to trim the sequence

71

and remove insertions in the genomes. Since the initial batch, the new sequences in

72

GISAID were periodically added to the pre-existing multiple sequence alignment (--

73

existing-alignment). The final multiple sequence alignment (MSA) contained 15,501

74

genomes that were available on May 1st 2020. In the metadata file, some genomes

75

lacked month and day information and contained the year of the sample collection date.

76

The genomes with incomplete metadata were filtered out and the unfiltered MSA

77

consisted of 15,277 sequences. Maximum likelihood phylogenetic tree was built with

78

IQ-TREE with the following options: -nt AUTO (on a 112-core server) -m GTR -fast.

79

Augur was used to estimate the molecular clock through TimeTree (Sagulenko, et al.

80

2018). For the sample EPI-ISL-428718 we additionally built a separate maximum

81

likelihood phylogenetic tree by using IQ-TREE multicore version 1.6.1 with Ultra-fast

82

Bootstrapping option and 1000 bootstraps.

83
84

The sub-tree consisting of Turkey isolates (Table-1) were retrieved from the master

85

time-resolved tree by removing the rest of the genomes with the 'Pruning' method from

86

ete3 toolkit (Huerta-Cepas, et al. 2016). The tree was visualized in FigTree v1.4.4

87

(http://tree.bio.ed.ac.uk/software/figtree/), and rerooted by selecting EPI_ISL_428718

88

as an outgroup. The branch lengths of EPI-ISL-417413 and EPI-ISL-428713 samples

89

were shortened for better visualization. Ggtree (Yu, et al. 2017) package in R was used

90

to generate the tree and corresponding clusters.

Genome clustering

93

We generated phylo-clusters with TreeCluster (Balaban, et al. 2019) which is

94

specifically designed to group viral genomes. The tool supports different clustering

95

options and we used the default option, Max Clade, which identifies clusters based on

96

two parameters, “-t” and “-s”. These parameters define the threshold that two leaf

97

nodes can be distant from each other and assign a minimum support value that connects

98

two leaf nodes or clades, respectively. For this analysis, we only used the distance

99

threshold. The Max Clade algorithm requires leaves to form a clade and satisfy the

100

distance threshold. The number of clusters that can be generated using a phylogenetic

101

tree depends on the pairwise leaf distance cutoff. We manually searched for a

102

meaningful cutoff for the number of phylo-clusters and phylo-subgroups based on their

103

similarity with the previously reported clusters (see below). We used the -t parameter as

104

0.0084 and 0.00463 for phylo-clusters and phylo-subclusters, respectively. After

105

retrieving the groupings from TreeCluster, we eliminated clusters containing less than

106

100 sequences (except one sub-cluster with 99 sequences). We categorized those

107

clusters having less than 100 sequences as not clustered. As a result, we obtained four

108

primary and seventeen sub-clusters.

109
110

L/S types of the SARS-CoV-2 genomes were previously defined based on the

111

nucleotides at 8782nd and 28144th positions (Tang, et al. 2020) . We categorized “TC”

112

and “CT” haplotypes S and L type, respectively. In the cases both these positions

113

correspond to a gap, the sequences were classified N type. All other cases were

114

categorized as unknown types. 614 G/D clustering was applied based on the amino acid

115

at the 614th position of the Spike protein (Jaimes, et al. 2020). Combinations of the

116

nucleotides at positions 241;1059; 3037; 8782; 11083; 14408; 14805; 17747; 17858;

117

18060; 23403; 25563; 26144; 28144; 28881; 28882; 28883 determined the subtypes for

118

barcode clustering. Sequences that belong to the ten major subtypes (with more than

119

100 sequences) which constitute 86 percent of all sequences were labelled with their

120

respective 17 nucleotides (Zhao, et al. 2020). All other sequences were categorized as

121

unknown for barcode classification. Six major clusters (Morais Júnior, et al. 2020) were

122

assigned by the previously determined twelve positions (3037; 8782; 11083; 14408;

123

17747; 17858; 18060; 23403; 28144; 28881; 28882; 28883). The lineages were

124

assigned using the proposed nomenclature by Rabaut et al. through Pangolin COVID-

125

19 Lineage Assigner web server (Rambaut, et al. 2020). Sequences that cannot be

126

assigned to any group were categorized as unknown for each classification scheme.

127
128

2.3.

Distance calculations

129

We rooted the maximum-likelihood tree for distance calculations by selecting samples

130

that belong to bats and pangolin as an outgroup, namely EPI-ISL-412976, EPI-ISL-

131

412977, and EPI-ISL-412860. We measured the distance from leaf to root for every leaf

132

node that is present in the phylogenetic tree with the ete3 toolkit (Huerta-Cepas, et al.

133

2016).

135

Variant information processing

136

Mutations for each position relative to the reference genome (GenBank:NC_045512.2)

137

were mapped catalogued in a table with a custom script. A table of all the mutations of

138

selected sequences was created and ordered according to the phylogenetic tree of the

139

corresponding genomes. Mutations that do not correspond to a nucleotide such as a gap

140

or N were labeled as “Gap or N”; the other mutations were marked as Nongap. For

141

variations that do not correspond to gap or N, respective nucleotides in the reference

142

genome were obtained and added to the table. The GFF file of the reference genome

143

(GCF_009858895.2) was extracted from NCBI Genome database. Open reading frame

144

(ORF) information of each mutation was retrieved from the GFF file and added to the

145

table. Positions that are not in the range of any ORF were labelled as “Non-coding

146

region”. Codon information and position of each mutation in the reference genome were

147

retrieved according to their respective ORF start positions and frame. In this process,

148

reported frameshifts in ORF1ab (Dos Ramos, et al. 2004; Kelly and Dinman 2020) and

149

the overlap between ORF7a 3’ and 7b 5’ ends were taken into account. Coding

150

information was used to assign amino acid substitution information to the variations.

151

Eventually, the variants were categorized as non-synonymous, synonymous, non-coding

152

regions.

153
154

Migration analysis

155

The maximum-likelihood phylodynamic analysis was performed with Treetime

156

(Sagulenko, et al. 2018) to estimate likely times of whole-genome sequences of SARS-

157

CoV-2 by computing confidence intervals of node dates and reconstruct phylogenetic

158

tree into the time-resolved tree. The slope of the root-to-tip regression was set to 0.0008

159

to avoid inaccurate inferences of substitution rates. With this model, we eliminated the

160

variation of rapid changes in clock rates by integration along branches (standard

161

deviation of the fixed clock rate estimate was set to 0.0004). The coalescent likelihood

162

was performed with the Skyline (Strimmer and Pybus 2001) model to optimize branch

163

lengths and dates of ancestral nodes and infer the evolutionary history of population

164

size. The marginal maximum likelihood assignment was used to assign internal nodes to

165

their most likely dates. Clock rates were filtered by removing tips that deviate more than

166

four interquartile ranges from the root-to-tip versus time regression. JC69 model was

167

used as General time-reversible (GTR) substitution models to calculate transition

168

probability matrix, actual substitution rate matrix, and equilibrium frequencies of given

169

attributes of sequences. The distribution of subleading migration states and entropies

170

were recorded for each location through Augur trait module (sampling bias correction

171

was set to 2.5). Closest child-parent pairs that do not go beyond their given locations

172

were identified and evaluated as transmissions using Auspice (Hadfield, et al. 2018).

Results

3.1.

Phylogenetic map of the virus subtypes

176

The first COVID-19 case in Turkey was reported on March 10th, 2020, later than the

177

reported first incidents in Asian and European countries. Since then, the number of

178

cases increased dramatically. We used all the genomes available in the GISAID

179

database as of May 1st, 2020 and built a phylogenetic tree. After we filtered out the

180

samples with incomplete date or location information, the total number of samples we

181

eventually used was 15,277. The phylogenetic tree was built with the maximum

182

likelihood method and a time-resolved tree was generated (Figure 1). To verify the

183

accuracy of the phylogenetic tree as well as to assess the distribution of well-

184

characterized genomic features, we mapped several classification schemes on the tree;

185

(i) S/L type (Tang, et al. 2020); (ii) D614G type (Bhattacharyya, et al. 2020); (iii)

186

barcodes (Zhao, et al. 2020); (iv) six major clusters (Morais Júnior, et al. 2020).

187

Although the methodologies of the clustering attempts were different between these

188

studies, in general, the previously established groups were in line with our phylogenetic

189

tree. Besides the already established clustering methods, we classified the clades based

190

on the phylogenetic tree only. There are two levels of clustering; we termed phylo-

191

clusters and phylo-subclusters. Small clusters were not taken into account (see

192

Methods). The phylogenetic map of the virus genomes clearly shows the two major S

193

and L type clades. As the ancestral clade, S-type is seen as limited in the number of

194

genomes. 29 of the 30 isolates in Turkey were classified in the L-type group.

195
196

The samples from Turkey are dispersed throughout the phylogenetic tree (Figure 1). The

197

30 samples are classified in 3 out of 4 different phylo-clusters and one remained

198

unclassified. The dispersed groups suggested multiple independent introductions to the

199

country. 7 of the 30 genomes encode aspartic acid (D) at the 614th position of the Spike

200

protein. The remaining 23 genomes encode glycine (G) in the same position. The D614G

201

mutation is hypothesized to dominate because it enables smoother transmission of the

202

virus (Bhattacharyya, et al. 2020). However, this correlation might simply be a founder

203

effect which is basically the loss or gain of a genetic information when large population

204

arise from a single individual.

205
206

3.2.

A transient genome between S and L strain suggests early introduction

207

One of the genomes isolated in Turkey (EPI-ISL-428718) clustered together with the

208

early subtypes of the virus. This isolate contains T at the position 8782, which is a

209

characteristic of the S-type; however, it has T at the position 28144, which coincides

210

with the L-type. Therefore, we characterized this sample as neither S- nor L-type. In the

211

phylogenetic tree, this genome is placed between S and L strains, which suggests a

212

transitioning genome from S to L strain (Figure 2). The number of variant nucleotides

213

between this sample and root is lower relative to other Turkey samples. Phylogenetic

214

placement in the earliest cluster, which is closer to the root, suggests that the lineage of

215

EPI-ISL-428718 entered Turkey as one of the earliest genomes. By the time this sample

216

was isolated in Turkey, the L-strain had started to spread in Europe, primarily in Italy.

217

Although the isolation date of this early sample is one week later than the first reported

218

case, the existence of an ancestral genome sequence suggests an earlier introduction of

219

SARS-CoV-2 to Turkey.

220
221

3.3.

Cluster profiles of the sample sets

222

Turkey has genome samples from at least three of the four major clusters. By taking the

223

transitioning genome into account, samples of Turkey are genuinely scattered in the

224

phylogenetic tree. Based on the groupings applied, we analyzed the relative abundances

225

of the clusters in Turkey and other countries (Figure 3A). The most samples of Turkey

226

belong to cluster 4. Iran, Denmark and France are also enriched in cluster 4. Most

227

European countries are enriched in cluster 3. Although Turkey has cluster 3 genomes,

228

the fraction of them is lower compared to European countries. With the available

229

genome sequences, the overall cluster profile of Turkey does not resemble any country.

230

The divergence of the samples from to tree root was calculated for each sub-cluster. The

231

sub-clusters observed in Turkey were analyzed along with the other countries (Figure

232

3B). The divergence rates are comparable in general. However, within the same sub-

233

clusters, virus genomes collected in Turkey have averagely more diverged than their

234

relatives in other countries. The isolated genomes assigned to sub-cluster 4 and 8 show

235

higher divergence rates in Turkey compared to the others in the same cluster (p-values:

236

0.00001 and 0.006, respectively, one tailed t-test between Turkey and the rest).

3.4.

Mutation analysis of the genomes retrieved in Turkey

239

We used the Turkey isolates (30) to analyze their mutational patterns and their

240

corresponding clusters. From the master tree, we pruned all the leaves except for the

241

samples of interest. We rooted the subtree at the transitioning sample. We aligned the

242

assigned clusters and all the mutations relative to the reference genome (Figure 4),

243

illustrating a correlation between the mutation pattern and the phylogenetic tree clades.

244

Observation of no recurrence of a mutation shows that the multiple mutations are the

245

results of founder effects.

246
247

In total, 55 unique mutations were detected, 2 and 20 of which are non-coding and

248

synonymous, respectively. Thirty-three unique amino acid substitutions are detected

249

(Table 2). 23 out of 30 genomes we analyzed have the 614G mutation. The D614G

250

mutation seems to have mutated with the two synonymous mutations in ORF1ab

251

(Figure 4). Besides 614G, three more amino acid substitutions were identified in the

252

spike protein (Table 2). G206A, T951I, G227S, S911F, A1420V, A3995F in ORF1a

253

and V772I, T1238I in Spike protein, V66L in ORF5 and S54L in ORF8 were found to

254

be specific to some isolates in Turkey (Table 2). The most abundant amino acid

255

substitutions (23/30) are P314L (ORF1b) and D614G (Spike), which are not specifically

256

enriched in Turkey and dispersed worldwide. ORF1a V378I and ORF9 S194L are found

257

in 7 and 6 of the 30 isolates, respectively, and show high frequency (15 folds with

The mutational landscape represents the natural classifications of major and sub-

261

clusters. These mutational footprints can be used to identify the clusters of the future

262

genomes. The combinations of mutations can be used as barcodes to group upcoming

263

virus genomes efficiently without a need for establishing evolutionary associations

264

across lineages, which is a computationally expensive procedure considering the

265

accumulating genomic data.

Trace of the spread

268

The number of mutations since December 2019 indicates that the SARS-CoV-2 genome

269

mutates twice a month, on average. As genome sequencing reveals mutations, it enables

270

a better understanding of the epidemiology by revealing the patterns of virus

271

transmission. The time-resolved phylogenetic distributions of the genomes collected in

272

Turkey suggested multiple independent sources of introduction (Figure 5A). Out of the

273

30 genomes analyzed in this work, the earliest introduction seems to have originated

274

from China. Other international imports include the US, Australia and Europe, probably

275

from the UK. There is a connection between Saudi Arabia and the two cities in Turkey.

276

Based on the model, this association is reciprocal. The Europe-based introductions are

277

seen in the genomes isolated in Istanbul. Within Turkey, a transmission hub appears to

278

be Ankara (Figure 5B). The isolates in 5 cities are associated with genomes collected in

279

Ankara (Figure 5C).

Web application to trace virus transmission

282

We have published a web application powered by Auspice

283

(sarscov2.adebalilab.org/latest). We employed the front-end package (Auspice) that

284

Nextstrain uses (Hadfield, et al. 2018). With increasing number of virus strains, not far

285

from now, it will be infeasible to display the entire phylogenetic tree even in modern

286

browsers. Nextstrain handles this problem by grouping the datasets based on the

287

continents. As the aim of this platform is to trace the spread of virus genomes associated

288

with Turkey, we will use representatives in the phylogenetic tree. The representative

289

sequences will cover all the subtypes. The genomes of the samples collected in Turkey

290

and their nearby sequences will be kept in the tree. With this approach, the web

291

application will always contain the genome data from Turkey and necessary information

292

of the subtypes with the representative sequences. An additional dimension we added to

293

the application is that it enables to trace virus across the cities of Turkey. This approach

294

is applicable to create a comprehensive platform for migration analysis for any country

295

or region of choice.

Discussion

298

There are two most abundant lineages of isolates in Turkey: sub-clusters 4 and 8. If the

299

30 samples unbiasedly represent the overall distribution of the strains in Turkey, sub-

300

clusters 4 and 8 might comprise approximately 80% of the genomes in the country. The

301

high divergence of the samples in these sub-clusters in Turkey relative to their

302

equivalents in other countries (Figure 3B) possibly suggests either or both of the two

303

scenarios; (i) the viruses dominantly circulating in Turkey were introduced to the

304

country later than other countries or (ii) this sub-cluster has been circulating in Turkey

305

at a relatively higher rate than other countries and because of that, it is more likely to

306

select the more diverged isolates by random sampling. Much more genomes should be

307

sequenced and analyzed to gain more insight into virus evolution. It is essential to
13

308

continuously follow up on the upcoming mutations when new samples are added to

309

GISAID database.

310
311

The phylogenetic analysis of the circulating genomes in a country is necessary to identify

312

the specific groups and their unique mutational patterns. The success of the COVID-19

313

diagnosis test kits, antibody tests and protein-targeting drugs possibly depend on genomic

314

variations. For antibody tests, if a mutation affects protein recognition, the sensitivity of

315

the test might drastically reduce. Therefore, mutation profiles of the isolates abundantly

316

circulating in the country should be taken into account to modify these tests. As

317

international travels are limited, viral genome profiles of the countries differ from each

318

other, which is known as bottleneck effect. If international transmissions are kept being

319

restricted, distinct cluster profiles might establish. Therefore, each country might need to

320

develop their specific tests targeting the abundant genomes circulating in local.

321
322

We must note that sample distribution is not in line with the case distribution across

323

Turkish cities. Due to this sampling bias as well as the low number of genomes, the spread

324

history is undoubtedly incomplete. For instance, only 3 of the 30 samples were collected

325

in Istanbul, which hosts approximately 60% of the COVID-19 cases. It is highly probable

326

that Istanbul will be revealed as the central hub when additional genomes are sequenced.

327

Moreover, there was no sample from Izmir, 3rd largest city. It should also be noted that

328

the lack of a sufficient number of genomes could have resulted in indirect associations

329

between the cities. More genomes are needed to complement this study with confidence.

331

The spread of the virus is traced by the personal declarations and travel history of the

332

infected people. As SARS-CoV-2 genomes spread, they leave foot prints behind

333

(mutations) allowing us to trace them. It is feasible to complement the conventional

334

approach with genome sequencing in an unbiased way. Implemented feature of city-

335

based tracing of the virus should be useful for authorities to take necessary measures to

336

prevent spread. This approach will be automated with a standard pipeline. We aim to

337

eliminate the technical limitations (because of the size) by applying filtering methods

338

without losing any relevant information.

451

according to 8782th and 28144th positions in the nucleotide. 614 G/D represents the

452

614th amino acid of the Spike protein. Barcode shows the 10 major subtypes of seventeen

positions in (nucleotide) multiple sequence alignment. Six-major clustering is based on 6

454

major subtypes of nucleotide combinations in particular positions. The fifth and sixth

Figure 4 - The mutation layout of the 30 samples from Turkey along with the

472

phylogenetic tree and clusters. Phylogenetic tree (left) of SARS-CoV-2 samples

473

sequenced in Turkey. Assigned subtypes of seven clustering methods are specified with

474

different colors in the matrix. Dot-plot (right) of mutations detected in each genome

475

aligned with the corresponding sample. Single nucleotide changes are colored and shaped

476

based on the nucleotide change and synonymy. Gray color indicates that the mutation is

477

either non-informative (ie, due to sequencing errors) or corresponds to a gap or an

478

ambiguous nucleotide. Supplementary bar (top) provides the respective open reading

479

frame information for mutations, and their effects on coding the amino acid. EPI-ISL-

481

curated and non-informative ones were treated as ambigious mutations.

Figure 5 - Epidemiological phylogenetic and transmission analysis of the isolates

486

collected in Turkey. Sequences sampled between 2019-03-19 and 2020-04-24 were

487

analyzed with Treetime and tracing between samples were visualized in Augur (version

488

6.4.3). (A) Closest (without internal nodes) leaves were used and assigned as

489

transmissions were visualized on Leaflet world map using latitude & longitude

490

information of locations. (B) Samples originated from Turkey were implied with orange

491

points and connections while the network of samples originated from other countries

492

demonstrated with blue lines and points. (C) Chord diagram was used as a graphical

493

method to display inter-flow directed associations between origins and destinations of

494

transmission data.
