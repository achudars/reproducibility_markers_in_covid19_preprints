Abstract
The Corona Virus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic that began in late
December 2019 has resulted in millions of cases diagnosed worldwide.
Reports have shown that SARS-CoV-2 shows extremely higher infection
rates than other coronaviruses. This study conducted a phylogenetics
analysis of 91 representative coronaviruses and found that the functional
spike protein of SARS-CoV-2, which interacts with the human receptor
ACE2, is actually not undergoing distinct selection pressure compared to
other coronaviruses. Furthermore, we define a new measurement,
infection group differential (IGD) score, in assessing the infection ability
of two human coronavirus groups. There are nine extremely high IGD
(ehIGD) sites in the receptor-binding domain (RBD) out of 40 high IGD
(hIGD) sites that exhibit a unique infection-related pattern from the
haplotype network and docking energy comparison. These 40 hIGD sites
are basically conserved among the SARS-CoV-2, i.e. there are only two
hIGD sites mutated in four out of 1,058 samples, defined as rare-mutation
hIGD (rhIGD) sites. In conclusion, ehIGD and rhIGD sites might be of
great significance to the development of vaccines.

Introduction
The COVID-19 pandemic caused by the new coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2)
continues to spread around the world as of this writing [1]. It is having a
broad and profound impact on the global health, politics, economy, and
society [2]. Apparently, SARS-CoV-2 has caused more infections and
deaths than SARS coronavirus (SARS-CoV) and MERS coronavirus
(MERS-CoV), whereas current research indicates that these all originated
from bats [3, 4]. Therefore, it is extremely important to investigate the
mutation and evolutionary characteristics of SARS-CoV-2, and the
analysis of the structure that causes its strong infectivity is of great
significance to the development of vaccines and control of the pandemic.
Coronaviruses are RNA viruses that consist of four subtypes: α, β, γ, and

δ [5]. SARS-CoV-2 belongs to the family of β coronaviruses and is the
seventh known coronavirus that can infect humans [6]. The remaining six
human coronaviruses are HCoV-229E, HCoV-OC43, HCoV-NL63,
HCoV-HKU1, SARS-CoV (causes Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome)
and MERS-CoV (triggers Middle East Respiratory Syndrome) [7].
Although the above coronaviruses can all infect humans, studies have
revealed different pathogenicity and variable clinical manifestations.
Some coronaviruses (HCoV-229E, HCoV-OC43, HCoV-NL63, and
HCoV-HKU1) only cause common cold, whereas SARS-CoV (R0 = 2-5,
case fatality rate = 10%), MERS-CoV (R0 = 0.3-0.8, case fatality rate =
40%), and SARS-CoV-2 can cause fever, cough, and pneumonia, which
can be fatal in severe cases [8].
The spike protein on the SARS-CoV-2 surface plays a key role in the
invasion into human cells [9]. Its structure determines whether it can
infect humans and how capable it is. First, the restriction sites on the
spike protein determine how the coronavirus is packaged into human cells.

The spike protein binds to the angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2)
on human cells through the receptor-binding domain (RBD), which then
initiates the infection [10]. Therefore, these restriction sites and RBD
characteristics have always been the focus of coronavirus research studies.
Therefore, the spike protein is of vital importance in studying the
infectivity and virulence of SARS-CoV-2 [11, 12].
Recent research indicates that there is a polybasic cleavage site at the
junction of the S1 and S2 subunits of the spike protein of SARS-CoV-2,
namely the Furin protease cleavage site (RRAR), and formed a special
O-linked glycan structure [9]. In addition, a comparison study of
SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 has shown that six amino acid residues in
RBD are the key sites for binding to human ACE2. However, five of them
in the SARS-CoV-2 sequence have been mutated, which may be
responsible for the enhanced binding to human ACE2 [13]. The
abovementioned restriction sites and mutations in the RBD structure have
always been the research hotspots of SARS-CoV-2. Currently, most of the
functional key residues were identified by direct interactions, i.e., by
exploring the protein-protein docking sites or enzyme-substrate binding
sites. In this work, we identify the sites that may be associated with
infection ability through sequence comparisons, as well as determine
significant variants between human and non-human coronaviruses. The
functional effects of these sites were evaluated by the protein-protein
virtual docking energy, and we plan to further assess these in a cell model
in our following study.

was

downloaded

from

GenBank

(https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/nuccore/MN908947.3?report=genbank,
2020/01/25). Approximately 44 spike proteins predicted from these
coronavirus genome data were used in searching for homologous
sequences in the database. Homologous sequence searching of SARS-like
coronaviruses spike protein was first performed by BLASTP (v 2.2.29+)
[14] in NR (Non-Redundant Protein Sequence Database), and 868
sequences were selected under the condition of sequence length > 600 aa
and a sequence identity > 30%. Next, the 868 sequences were classified
into 124 clusters criteria of sequence identity ≥ 95% and sequence length
≥ 90%. Taking the longest sequences as the representative strain in each
cluster and checking the NCBI genome database, 91 of 124 strains were
found to have complete genome sequences in NCBI. Table S2 lists the
accession numbers and taxonomic characteristics of 91 representative
coronaviruses. Finally, the protein sequences of each coronavirus were
predicted by GeneMarks from the genome DNA sequences and used in
the subsequent phylogenetic analysis.
1458 SARS-CoV-2 genomes were downloaded from the GISAID
database (https://www.gisaid.org/, 2020/03/25). After removing the
non-human strains and strains with low sequence quality, 1,058
SARS-CoV-2 strains were used in the phylogenetic analysis.
Phylogenetic analysis
The DNA sequences of whole genome and related protein sequences of
91 coronaviruses were aligned using mafft v7.455 [15], and the result

multiple sequence was trimmed for poorly aligned positions with Gblock
0.91b [16]. RAxML v8.2.12 [17] was used to build the maximum
likelihood phylogenetic tree of genomes with the parameters “-m
GTRCAT” and protein with the parameters “-m PROTGAMMAILGX”.
R package “ggtree” [18] was used to display phylogenetic tree.
Codon usage bias analysis
Condonw v1.3 [19] was used to calculate the universal index value of
each codon of the Cds of coronavirus functional protein.
Ka/Ks analysis
Ka/KS ratios were calculated using KaKs_Calculator 2.0 [20] and used in
the analysis of selection pressure.
Visual analysis of multiple sequence alignments
Mafft was used to generate the multi-sequence aligned data-based amino
acid sequence of coronavirus spike proteins and domains. R package
“ggmsa” was used to visualize the results. From the multiple alignment,
the sequence identities within and between groups could be calculated at
each position. The “Ratio (3 & 83)” were calculated from the identities
between the high infection human coronaviruses group and none-human
coronaviruses group. The “Ratio (5 & 83)” were calculated from the
identities between the low infection human coronaviruses group and
none-human coronaviruses group. The infection group (similarity)
differential (IGD) scores were calculated from ratio (3 & 83) and ratio (5
& 83). From the total 1,273 positions of S1 subunit of spike protein, the
mean and sd values were calculated, thus the high IGD (hIGD) sites
defined as IGD score greater than the mean + 3sd value, while the
extremely high IGD (ehIGD) site defined as IGD score greater than the
mean + 5sd value. For each ehIGD in S1 subunit, the hIGD and ehIGD
sites in the range of up- and down-stream 25 amino acids residues were

connected and defined as a hIGD region. Furthermore, the rhIGD sites
defined as the rare mutation with frequency less than 0.5% of hIGD sites
among SARS-CoV-2 sequences.
Haplotype network analysis
DnaSP v6.12.03 [21] was used to generate multi-sequence aligned
haplotype data. Arlequin v3.5.2.2 [22] was used to estimate haplotype
frequency. PopART v1.7 [23] was used to generate haplotype networks
based on the haplotypes generated by DnaSP and Arlequin.
Structure prediction and protein-protein docking
The structure of human ACE2 receptor was obtained from PDB database
(https://www.rcsb.org/, PDB_ID: 6acc) [24]. The structure of the RBD
domain of SARS-CoV-2 spike protein was obtained from PDB database
(PDB_ID: 6m17) [25]. The structures of mutants of RBD for the ehIGD
sites changing to the amino acids of other highly infectious coronavirus
were homology modeling using SWISS-MODEL [26].
The structure of SARS-CoV-2 spike protein was homology modeling
from the structure of SARS-CoV spike protein (PDB_ID: 6vsb) since it
hasn’t been fully resolved yet till the submitted data of this work. Thus,
the structures of mutants of spike protein for the rhIGD sites changing to
the amino acids of other type of SARS-CoV-2 were also homology
modeling using SWISS-MODEL.
For protein-protein docking, we employed the online software
SwarmDock [27] and MOE (v2019) to perform the virtual docking
between human ACE2 receptor and RBD domain, spike protein and
mutants of SARS-CoV-2. For each complex of docking, we conducted
100 independent conformations, and selected the conformation with the
lowest binding energy as the final result.

Results
Phylogenetic analysis of coronaviruses and SARS-CoV-2
The overview of this work is presented in Figure 1A. We searched all
coronaviruses with spike protein in the NCBI database, which classified
these into clusters and selected representative strains with complete
genome sequences to avoid data collection bias.
Phylogenetic analysis of the entire genome of 91 representative
coronaviruses

shows

that

SARS-CoV-2

and

SARS-CoV_bat_SL_CovZC45 have the closest evolutionary distance
compared to other human coronaviruses (Figure S1). This result has been
reported before, indicating that SARS-CoV-2 may have evolved from bat
coronaviruses [28]. From Figure 1B, the haplotype network constructed
based on the receptor-binding domain (RBD) of 91 representative
coronavirus spike proteins, which showed that the haplotype of
SARS-CoV-2 is on the same branch as the haplotype of SARS-CoV and
MERS-CoV. On the other hand, the low infection human coronavirus, i.e.
HCoV-229E, HCoV-OC43, HCoV-NL63, and HCoV-HKU1, cluster
closely

in

the

other

branch.

Intriguingly,

the

SARS-CoV_bat_SL_CoVZC45 located in the medium of high and low
infection coronaviruses, unlike the phylogenetic relationship of whole
genome presented in Figure.S1, indicating that the haplotype of the
coronavirus RBD has a higher correlation to pathogenicity than
phylogenetic relationship.
Simultaneously, we collected all available SARS-CoV-2 sequencing data
from the GISAID database. After filtering nonhuman strains and
low-quality sequencing strains, approximately 1,058 strains from total 43
countries of 6 continents remained (Table S4 and S5). Multiple sequence
alignment of the S1 subunit of the global SARS-CoV-2 spike protein

shows that the N-terminal domain (NTD) and RBD are conserved
(identity > 97% within global SARS-CoV-2, Figure S2), particularly
SARS-CoV-2 from the Asia RBD area (identity > 99%, Table S6). As
shown in Figure 1C, the haplotype network analysis of these
representative SARS-CoV-2 strains and 7 human coronaviruses shows
that the spike protein haplotype of SARS-Cov-2 were clearly divided into
two clusters, and closest to the haplotype of SARS-CoV. The larger
cluster, which is closer to both SARS-CoV and HCoV-OC43, contain 768
haplotypes of SARS-CoV-2 composed by 42% Asian, 39% North
American, and 14% European samples. And another cluster contains 290
haplotypes including 74% European, 17% North American, and 5% Asian
samples. From this network, the haplotype of HCoV-OC43 is closer to
SARS-Cov-2 haplotype than MERS-CoV. Thus, the haplotype network
constructed from spike protein might reflect partial pathogenicity
relationship but the specific sites with more influence on the infection
need to be further explored.
Selection analysis of coronaviruses and SARS-CoV-2
The main functional proteins of coronaviruses include the membrane
protein, nucleocapsid protein, orf1a polyprotein, orf1b polyprotein, and
spike protein. To explore the evolutionary characteristics of SARS-CoV-2
compared with other coronaviruses, we first compared the sequence
identities of the entire genome and 5 functional proteins of 91
coronaviruses. The results show that the sequence of the orf1b
polyprotein is relatively conserved, whereas the spike protein sequence
differs among these coronaviruses (Figure S3). Then, we conducted
codon preference analysis of different protein domains of the 91
coronaviruses, including spike protein, connection domain (CD), central
helix (CH), heptad repeat 1 (HR1), NTD, and RBD. The results show that

bioRxiv preprint doi: https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.05.12.090324; this version posted May 13, 2020. The copyright holder for this preprint (which

the codon preference of SARS-CoV-2 is basically similar to the other
coronaviruses (Figure S4). Furthermore, Ka/Ks analysis of 5 functional
proteins of 91 coronaviruses shows that the 5 functional proteins of
SARS-CoV-2 mainly underwent neutral evolution in 91 coronaviruses
(Figure S5A). However, the orf1a polyprotein gene of SARS-CoV-2 has
been subjected to purification selection in human coronavirus, whereas
the others underwent neutral evolution (Figure S5B). These findings
suggest that the spike protein of SARS-CoV-2 did not undergo special
selection pressure compared to other coronaviruses.
Infection group differential (IGD) sites and regions in spike protein
of SARS-CoV-2
To study sites of the spike protein of SARS-CoV-2 that are related to
infectivity, we firstly classified 91 representative coronaviruses into three
groups, i.e. high infection coronaviruses group (including SARS-Cov-2,
SARS-CoV, and MERS-CoV), low infection coronaviruses group
(including HCoV-229E, HCoV-OC43, HCoV-NL63, and HCoV-HKU1),
none-human

coronaviruses

group

(including

83

non-human

coronaviruses). After that, we performed sequence alignment on 91
representative coronaviruses and calculated the similarity of each amino
acid position within groups and between groups, as shown in Figure 2A,
Figure 2B, Figure 2D and Figure 2E. Thus, the “Ratio (3 & 83)” and
“Ratio (5 & 83)” should reflect the sequences differentiation between the
human and none-human coronaviruses, as shown in Figure 2C and Figure
2F.
Finally, we defined infection group differential (IGD) score to measure
the residues feature between the high infection and low infection
coronaviruses groups. As shown in Figure 2G, the IGD score of each
position is calculated from the similarity ratio between the two groups of

bioRxiv preprint doi: https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.05.12.090324; this version posted May 13, 2020. The copyright holder for this preprint (which

human coronaviruses. The high IGD (hIGD) score demonstrates the
significant differentiation (IGD score greater than mean + 3sd value)
between two human coronaviruses groups. Therefore, 40 hIGD sites in
the spike protein sequence indicate the characteristic regions of
coronavirus infectivity, shown in Figure S6 and Table S7a. In addition,
we have defined the “Region” of hIGD sites in S1 subunit, thus the seven
regions distributed with 31 hIGD sites. In particular, the six key residues
of RBD binding to ACE2 [13] were assigned to Region IV, V and VI,
while the Furin protease cleavage sites and the special O-link glycan
residues [29] were located in Region VII, as shown in Figure 2G and
Table S7a.
Special hIGD sites and influence to SARS-Cov-2 infection
To further explore the potential importance of hIGD sites, we focus on
some special hIGD sites, i.e. extremely high IGD (ehIGD) sites in RBD
region and rhIGD sites from current dataset. Here, the ehIGD sites
defined as IGD score greater than mean + 5sd value, and rhIGD indicated
mutation of 40 hIGD in 1058 SARS-Cov-2 which are actually rare
mutation with frequency less than 0.5%.
The specific positions of nine ehIGD sites and two rhIGD sites in S1
subunit of SARS-CoV-2 are shown in Figure 3A. The haplotype network
of nine ehIGD sites in RBD is shown in Figure 3B. It shows that the
distances between the haplotype of SARS-CoV-2 and other human
coronaviruses are closely related to their infection ability. In particular,
the most closely related coronaviruses are SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV,
and there is only one differential amino acid between SARS-CoV-2 and
SARS-CoV (SARS-CoV-2: G485; SARS-CoV: A485). However, the nine
corresponding positions of HCoV-OC43, HCoV-HKU1_N14, and
HCoV-HKU1_N16 are different from SARS-CoV-2. HCoV-229E and

bioRxiv preprint doi: https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.05.12.090324; this version posted May 13, 2020. The copyright holder for this preprint (which

HCoV-NL63 did not even exist in the haplotype network because these
have a total of nine deletion sites from the multiple alignments.
Among the total 40 hIGD sites from our analysis, only two rhIGD sites
among the 1,058 SARS-CoV-2 strains actually occurred in only two
Asian (India and Georgia) and two European (Netherlands) samples
(Figure 3C, Table. S8). Compared with the majority of haplotype, the
Type 1 haplotype has a deletion of residue 144, whereas the Type 2
haplotype has a substitution of E654 to Q654.
To verify the above crucial sites of SARS-CoV-2, we compared the
affinity of the spike protein and ACE2 before and after ehIGD and rhIGD
site mutation based on protein-protein docking (Figure 3D and 3E). The
results show that the binding energy of SARS-CoV-2 and ACE2 is the
lowest before mutation, especially when using MOE2019 for docking.
Then the binding energy is basically increased after ehIGD sites are
mutated (Figure 3D). Moreover, mutations at two rhIGD sites, which
increases the binding energy, also seem to have an impact on the ability
of SARS-CoV-2 to bind to ACE2 (Figure 3E). Therefore, nine ehIGD and
two rhIGD sites of the spike protein are highly likely to be closely related
to

the

high

infectivity

of

SARS-CoV-2.

However,

additional

investigations are warranted.

Discussion
Coronaviruses mainly originate from animals, and some gradually evolve
to infect humans. The different sequence characteristics of these human
coronaviruses determine the differences in infection ability and
pathogenicity. The high infection ability of SARS-CoV-2 is responsible
for the rapid spread of COVID-19, and thus we attempted to study the
distinctive sequence features of SARS-CoV-2.

We started with the spike protein of SARS-like coronaviruses and
obtained 91 representative coronaviruses (including eight coronaviruses
that can infect humans) through genome sequence alignment and
screening. We analyzed the evolutionary characteristics of these
coronaviruses and their spike proteins, and found that spike protein
variations associated with receptor binding are the largest and mainly
underwent neutral evolution among the functional proteins of these
coronaviruses.
In this work, we defined a new measurement, namely, the sequence
similarity ratio, to measure the sequence feature among coronavirus
groups with different infection abilities. The haplotype networks
constructed by the ehIGD residues reveal that the network distance
between different coronaviruses strains and SARS-CoV-2 is proportional
to their infection ability but not their phylogenetic distance. Therefore, we
hypothesized that ehIGD residues influence the infection ability of
SARS-CoV-2.
Only two rhIGD sites over 40 hIGD sites are not statistically significant
(Fisher test, p=0.7653) compared with the total of 1058 polymorphic sites
over 1,273 residues in the spike protein (Table S7b). These findings
suggest that SARS-CoV-2 has not undergone large-scale major mutations
yet, and the development of related vaccines are still important and of
great significance.
Some of these crucial residues are also consistent with the functional sites
in previous reports. For example, G482, V483, E484, and G485 are
reported to be the functionally important epitopes of SARS-CoV-2
binding to ACE2 [11]. Another example is that SARS-CoV-2 has a unique
ACE2 interacting residue K417 that forms salt-bridge interactions with
ACE2 D30 [12]. G485 is in the list of our ehIGD sites, and we

additionally found novel G339, G447, N448, Y449, L461, P491, Q506
and P507 residues in RBD with high IGS score between different
infection ability coronaviruses. Whether these sites are related to the
SARS-CoV-2 infection ability is unclear, and we are currently verifying
this using a cell model.
The discovery and confirmation of key sites related to SARS-CoV-2
infection ability are crucial to the design of vaccines and therapeutic
drugs. At current stage, the effect of ehIGD and rhIGD sites have been
verified by virtual protein-protein docking. The future biologic evaluation
is performing at cell level.
