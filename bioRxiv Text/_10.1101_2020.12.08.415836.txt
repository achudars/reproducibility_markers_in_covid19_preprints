ABSTRACT
The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) caused by a novel coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2)
has become a major health problem affecting more than fifty million cases with over one million
deaths globally. The effective antivirals are still lacking. Here, we optimized a high-content
imaging platform and the plaque assay for viral output study using the legitimate model of human
lung epithelial cells, Calu-3, to determine anti-SARS-CoV–2 activity of Andrographis paniculata
extract and its major component andrographolide. SARS-CoV-2 at 25TCID50 was able to reach
the maximal infectivity of 95% in Calu-3 cells. Post-infection treatment of A. paniculata and
andrographolide in SARS-CoV–2 infected Calu-3 cells significantly inhibited the production of
infectious virions with the IC50 of 0.036 µg/mL and 0.034 µM, respectively, as determined by
plaque assay. The cytotoxicity profile developed over the cell line representatives of major organs,
including liver (HepG2 and imHC), kidney (HK-2), intestine (Caco-2), lung (Calu-3) and brain
(SH-SY5Y), showed the CC50 of >100 µg/mL for A. paniculata extract and 13.2-81.5 µM for
andrographolide, respectively, corresponding to the selectivity index over 380. In conclusion, this
study provided experimental evidence in favor of A. paniculata and andrographolide for further
development as a monotherapy or in combination with other effective drugs against SARS-CoV–
2 infection.

INTRODUCTION
The outbreak of Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) is an emergent global health crisis
that requires urgent solutions. Since severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV2) has been emerged in Wuhan, Hubei, China at the end of 2019,1 the total confirmed cases are
approaching seventy millions with more than one million deaths globally at the end of December
2020. SARS-CoV–2 is a positive sense, single-stranded, enveloped RNA virus belonging to
Coronaviridae family, and categorized as a new member of Betacoronavirus genus together with
severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) in 2003 and middle east respiratory
syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) in 2012.2-4 The host range of SARS-CoV-2 is very broad
partly due to the relative conservation of the cellular receptor, angiotensin-converting enzyme 2
(ACE2), among mammals. This phenomenon could explain the interspecies transmission of the
virus from animals to cause disease in humans.5 Even though the majority of infection was
asymptomatic, clinical manifestations of COVID-19 varies widely, ranging from low-grade fever
to severe pneumonia and eventually death. The outcome of the infection depended largely on host
factors, e.g., age, previous health problems, and immunological status.6-8 Among critical
manifestations, acute respiratory distress syndrome, cytokine storm, and multi-organ failure are
the leading causes of death in COVID-19.9, 10
Lacking the effective antivirals against SARS-CoV-2 is undoubtedly one of the main
reasons of poor clinical outcomes in severe COVID-19 patients. Drug discovery and repurposing
strategies are pursuing to identify potential therapeutic agents.11-13 A beneficial instance of this
effort was repositioning of remdesivir (that originally developed for Ebola virus infection) for
COVID-19 treatment.14, 15 Unfortunately, subsequent well-conducted clinical trials revealed that
remdesivir had marginally clinical efficacy,15, 16 while the cost-effectiveness and accessibility are
still a huge concern.17 Therefore, further efforts should be made to identify new compounds with
the potent anti-SAR-CoV-2 activity. Among all promising candidates, natural products are
recognized as the major source for new drug discovery over decades.18 Ethnobotanical evidence
suggests plant-derived natural compounds are worth investigating to identify potent antivirals
against coronaviruses,19 while computational approaches have been applied for phytochemicals in
order to define their target-specific antiviral potential against SARS-CoV-2.20
One of prominent medicinal plants with various pharmacological activities is
Andrographis paniculate, known as “King of bitters”, which belongs to Acanthaceae family.21 A.
paniculate is currently used in the traditional medicine to treat common cold, diarrhea, fever due
to several infectious causes, and as a health tonic.22 A major bioactive component of A. paniculata
is andrographolide,23 a diterpene lactone in the isoprenoid family, which is known for its broadspectrum anti-viral properties.24 Andrographolide has recently predicted in silico to have a potent
anti-SARS-CoV-2 activity through specific targeting the host ACE2 receptor and the viral factors,
i.e., RNA-dependent RNA polymerase, main protease, 3-CL protease, PL protease, and spike
protein.25-28 Recently, Shi TH, et al., applied an enzyme-based assay to demonstrate an inhibitory
effect of andrographolide against SARS-CoV-2 main protease (Mpro).29 Furthermore, our group
has utilized a phenotypic cell-based immunofluorescent assay (IFA) to reveal the anti-SARS-CoV2 effect of A. paniculata extract and andrographolide in the African green monkey kidney cells
(Vero E6).30 Notably that the anti-SARS-CoV-2 activity of A. paniculata extract and
andrographolide has never been elucidated in the infected human lung epithelial cells.
This study aimed to evaluate the anti-SARS-CoV-2 activity of A. paniculata extract and
its major component andrographolide by using a legitimate model of infected human lung
epithelial cell, Calu-3.31 Cytotoxic profiles of A. paniculata extract and andrographolide over five

major human organs, including lung, brain, liver, kidney, and intestine were achieved by a panel
of cell line representatives. The results demonstrated that A. paniculata extract and
andrographolide have a potent anti-SARS-CoV-2 activity with a high safety margin for major
organs in cell culture models.
MATERIALS AND METHODS
Cell culture
African green monkey (Cercopithecus aethiops) kidney epithelial cells (Vero cells)
(ATCC® CCL-81), Vero cell derivative (Vero E6 cells) (ATCC® CRL-1586), human liver cancer
cell line (HepG2) (ATCC® HB-8065), human colon cancer cell line (Caco-2) (ATCC® HTB-37),
human airway epithelial cell line (Calu-3) (ATCC® HTB-55), human neuroblastoma cell line (SHSY5Y) (ATCC® CRL-2266) and human normal kidney (HK-2) (ATCC® CRL-2190) were
obtained from American Type Culture Collection (ATCC, Manassas, VA, USA). An
Immortalized Hepatocyte-Like Cell Line (imHC) was established in-house as previously
described56 and its hepatic phenotypes were characterized previously.57, 58 Vero cells were cultured
in Minimum Essential Medium (MEM) (Gibco, Detroit, MI, USA). Vero E6 cells and Caco-2
were cultured in Dulbecco's Modified Eagle's Medium (DMEM) (Gibco, Detroit, MI, USA).
HepG2, imHC, Calu-3, and SH-SY5Y cells were cultured in Dulbecco's Modified Eagle
Medium:Nutrient Mixture F-12 (DMEM/F-12) (Gibco, Detroit, MI, USA). HK-2 cells were
cultured in Dulbecco's Low Glucose Modified Eagles Medium (DMEM low glucose) (HyClone,
Logan, UT, USA). The culture media was supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS)
(Thermo Scientific Fisher, Waltham, MA, USA) and 100 µg/mL penicillin/streptomycin
(Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA, USA) and 1% GlutaMAX™ (Gibco, Detroit, MI, USA). Cells were
incubated at 37°C in a humidified incubator with 5% CO2.
Preparation of SARS-CoV–2 virus
SARS-CoV-2 virus was isolated from nasopharyngeal swabs of a confirmed COVID-19
patient in Thailand (SARS-CoV–2/01/human/Jan2020/Thailand). The virus was propagated in
Vero E6 cells as previous described30 and stored at -80°C. Viral titration as TCID50 titer/mL was
performed in the 96-well plate. In brief, the virus stock was titrated in quadruplicate in 96-well
plates on Vero E6 cells in serial dilution to obtain 50% tissue culture infectious dose (TCID50)
using the Reed Muench method.59 All the experiments with live SARS-CoV-2 viruses were
performed at a certified biosafety level 3 facility at Department of Microbiology, Faculty of
Science, Mahidol University.
Preparation of Andrographis paniculata extract and andrographolide
Plant material in this study was common herbs in Thailand, and it was listed in Thai Herbal
Pharmacopoeia 2019 (https://bdn.go.th/th/sDetail/10/34/). The plant was identified, authenticated
by Chao Phya Abhaibhubejhr Hospital, Prachin Buri, Thailand, and deposited at the herbarium
unit. The powder of Andrographis paniculata was weighed and soaked in 95% ethanol in a ratio
of 1:4. After 24 hours, liquid fraction was separated using a thin straining cloth then filtered
through filter paper by vacuum pump. The extract was obtained was concentrated using rotary
evaporator at temperature 45°C and then concentrated in water bath at 70°C until it turned
concentrated solution. The crude extract was stored at 4°C and protected from light until use.60
The andrographolide concentration in the crude extract was measured by HPLC method in

following Thai Herbal Pharmacopoeia 2019 protocol. The andrographolide content in crude
extract was 7.9% (w/w).61 The analytical standard andrographolide was used as a reference
(Sigma, St. Louis, MO, USA).
In vitro antiviral assay
Calu-3 cells were seeded at 1×104 cell per well in a 96-black well plate (Corning, NY,
USA) and incubated for 24 h at 37°C in 5% CO2 atmosphere. Then, culture media was discarded
and washed once with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS). Cells were infected with SARS-CoV-2 at
25TCID50 for 2 h at 37°C. After viral adsorption, the cells were washed twice with PBS to remove
the excessive inoculum, and the fresh culture medium (DMEM/F12 supplemented with 10% FBS,
100 µg/ml Penicillin/Streptomycin) was added. Each concentration of drugs, crude extract, or
active compound was inoculated into the culture medium. Infected cells were then maintained at
37°C in 5% CO2 incubator for 48 h. Positive convalescent serum (heat-inactivated at 56°C for 30
min) of a COVID-19 patient and anti-human IgG (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Dallas, TX, USA)
were used for a viral inhibition as positive control and negative control, respectively. The
experiment was performed in triplicate.
High-content imaging for SARS-CoV-2 nucleoprotein detection
The cells in the 96-well plate were fixed and permeabilized with 50% (v/v) acetone in
methanol on ice for 20 min. The fixed cells were washed once with phosphate-buffered saline
with 0.5% Tween detergent (PBST) and blocked with 2% (w/v) BSA in PBST for 1 h at room
temperature. Next, the cells were incubated with 1:500 dilution ratio of primary antibody specific
for SARS-CoV nucleoprotein56 (Rabbit mAb) (Sino Biological Inc. China), which cross-reacting
with the NP protein of SARS-CoV–2 as well, for 1 h at 37°C. After incubation, cells were washed
with PBST three times. Then, the Goat anti-Rabbit IgG Alexa Fluor 488 (Thermo Scientific
Fisher, Waltham, MA, USA) was used as the secondary antibody at 1:500 dilution. Hoechst dye
(Thermo Scientific Fisher, Waltham, MA, USA) was applied for nuclei staining. The fluorescent
signal was detected and analyzed by the Operetta high-content imaging system (PerkinElmer,
Waltham, MA, USA) as previously described.30 Percentage of the infected cells in each well was
automatically obtained from 13 fields per well using Harmony software (PerkinElmer, Waltham,
MA, USA). Data was normalized to the infected control, and IC50 value was calculated by
GraphPad Prism 7.
Plaque assay
The viral output in culture supernatants obtained from SARS-CoV-2-infected Calu-3 cells
were determined by plaque assay by using Vero cell monolayer. In brief, Vero cells were seeded
into 6-well plate 24-h prior to infection. A serial dilution of the virus-containing supernatants was
prepared for inoculation into Vero cell monolayer. The cells were incubated for viral adsorption
for 1 hr at 37°C incubator and then overlaid with 3 mL/well of MEM medium supplemented with
5% FBS and 1% agarose. The culture was incubated at 37°C in 5% CO2 for three days. Thereafter,
plaque phenotypes were visualized by staining with 0.33% Neutral Red solution (Sigma-Aldrich,
St. Louis, MO, USA) for 5 hrs. Plaque numbers were counted as plaque-forming units per milliliter
(PFUs/mL) and reported as the percentage of plaque reduction in comparison to supernatant
obtained from the infected Calu-3 without any treatment.

All human cell lines were plated in 96-well plates at 5×104 cells/well and treated with various
concentrations of Andrographis paniculata extract (0-100 µg/mL) and Andrographolide (0-100
µM) for 48 h. Cell viability was examined by an MTT colorimetric assay. In brief, the medium
was replaced with MTT [3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide] (SigmaAldrich, St. Louis, MO, USA) final concentration at 0.5 mg/mL and incubated for 4 h at 37°C in
a humidified incubator with 5% CO2. The rest of MTT solution was removed, and formazan
crystals were then dissolved with DMSO (Merck, Schuchardt, Darmstadt, Germany).
Absorbance was measured at a wavelength of 570 nm by EnVision Multilabel Reader
(PerkinElmer, Waltham, MA, USA). Data was normalized to the solvent control, and then CC50
values were calculated using GraphPad Prism 7.

RESULTS AND DISCUSSION
Optimization of human lung epithelial cells (Calu-3)-based anti-SARS-CoV-2 assay
Urgent demands of the effective anti-SARS-CoV–2 agents draw many attentions of
scientific communities to explore for new antiviral candidates. In this study, we aimed to document
the anti-SARS-CoV–2 activity of A. paniculata extract and andrographolide (Figure 1A) for
further drug development against COVID-19. Therefore, a robust anti-SARS-CoV-2 screening
platform established on the legitimate model is required to facilitate this process. For serving this
proposes, we optimized our antiviral assay (which previously established upon Vero E6 cells)30 to
use Calu-3 human lung epithelial cells as the legitimate host cell for SARS-CoV-2 infection,31 and
then validated the assay applicability by hydroxychloroquine and niclosamide (Figure 1B and 1C,
respectively), two FDA-approved drugs with anti-SAR-CoV-2 activities in vitro.31-33

Calu-3 cells were cultured until reach confluence, and then infected with various
concentrations of SARS-CoV-2, ranging from 0.25TCID50, 2.5TCID50, and 25TCID50 for 2 hrs.
The cells were washed twice to remove the excessive inoculum, and further incubated in the fresh
culture medium for 48 hrs in the absence or presence of the compounds of interest. To demonstrate

the degree of SARS-CoV-2 infectivity, the infected Calu-3 cells were strained by anti-SARSCoV2 nucleoprotein rabbit monoclonal antibody, following by goat anti-rabbit IgG Alexa Fluor
488, and counted the percentage of fluorescent positive cells by the high-content imaging platform.
The percentage of viral infectivity in Calu-3 cells at 48 hours post-infection achieved
approximately 1%, 18% and 95%, upon infection at 0.25TCID50, 2.5TCID50, and 25TCID50,
respectively (Figure 2A and 2B upper panel). Since SARS-CoV-2 at 25TCID50 was able to reach
maximal infectivity, it was served as the standard infectious dosage throughout all experiments.
To establish the positive control, the neutralizing serum derived from COVID-19 patients with
negative SARS-CoV-2 RNA was added to the infected Calu-3 cells. The high-content imaging
revealed viral suppression in Calu-3 cells with the percentage of SARS-CoV-2 infectivity of 0%,
10%, 60% and 80% at 1:100, 1:500, 1:2,500 and 1:25,000 dilutions of the neutralizing serum,
respectively (Figure 2A and 2B lower panel). In this study, anti-human IgG was served as the
negative control.

was used to detect the degree of SAR-CoV-2 viral replication. The positive control, neutralizing
serum, demonstrated the dose-dependent effect, whereas the negative control human IgG had no
antiviral activity. (B) Representative fluorescent images show SARS-CoV–2 infectivity at

Representative fluorescent images of niclosamide experiment.
As aforementioned, hydroxychloroquine and niclosamide31-33 were applied to evaluate the
validity of Calu-3-based anti-SARS-CoV-2 assay. Hydroxychloroquine, a classical anti-malarial
drug, had no inhibitory effect against SARS-CoV-2 infection in human lung epithelial cells
(IC50>50 µM) (Figure 2C and 2D), while niclosamide, a classical anti-helminthic drug, inhibited
SARS-CoV-2 infection with the IC50 of 0.90 µM (Figure 2E and 2F). Of note,
hydroxychloroquine can exhibit antiviral effect in Vero E6 cells30 but not Calu-3 human lung
epithelial cells.31 These results were consistent to previous reports 31, 32 and supported the validity
of Calu-3-based anti-SARS-CoV-2 assay used in this study.
Dose-response relationship of A. paniculata extract and andrographolide in SARS-CoV-2
infected human lung epithelial cells
To investigate whether A. paniculata extract and its major component andrographolide
have potentials for anti-SARS-CoV–2 agents, SARS-CoV–2 infected Calu-3 cells were treated for
48-h with 4-fold dilutions of A. paniculata extract (0.05-50 µg/mL) or andrographolide (0.05-50
µM), respectively. The results demonstrated both A. paniculata extract (Figure 3A and 3B) and
andrographolide (Figure 3C and 3D) inhibited SARS-CoV-2 replication in the dose-dependent
manner.

concentrations of A. paniculata extract or andrographolide for 48 h before harvesting for highcontent imaging analysis. (A) A. Paniculata extract showed the dose-dependent inhibition of

Andrographolide, the major component of A. Paniculata extract, exhibited potent anti-SARSCoV-2 activity. (D) Representative fluorescent images of andrographolide experiment. Inhibition
of infectious virions released from SARS-CoV-2 infected Calu-3 was evaluated by plaque
reduction assay after treatment with (E) A. paniculata extract and (F) andrographolide. All
experiments were performed in three biological replicates.
To confirm anti-SARS-CoV2 activity of A. paniculata extract and andrographolide,
analysis of viral output using plaque reduction assay was performed. At 48-h post-infection in the
absence or presence of compounds of interest, the culture supernatants were harvested to determine
the number of the infectious virion production from SARS-CoV-2 infected Calu-3 cells by plaque
assay. From the result, evaluation of viral output was consistent to that of high-content imaging
study (Figure 3A-3D), in which A. paniculata extract and andrographolide again demonstrated
the dose-response relationship (Figure 3E and 3F) with the IC50 of 0.036 µg/mL for A. paniculata
and 0.034 µM for andrographolide (Figure 3E and 3F).
It was interesting that the IC50 values of A. paniculata extract and andrographolide varied
between the high-content imaging IFA and viral output study using plaque assay. Taking our

previous study30 into account, the IC50 of A. paniculata extract and andrographolide by the types
of measure and cell host can be summarized in Table 1. The IC50 values of remdesivir30 served
as the comparator.

As shown in Table 1, the consistent pattern has been detected for A. paniculata extract,
andrographolide, and remdesivir; i) the IC50 values measured from the assays using Calu-3 were
lower than those of Vero E6; ii) the IC50 values measured by plaque assay were lower than those
of high-content imaging IFA. The deviation of drug response between two cells of differed species
and organs highlighted the importance of using Calu-3 human lung epithelial cells, but not Vero
E6 African green monkey kidney cells, as the host cells for in vitro SARS-CoV-2 infection
experiments.31 The dissimilarity of IC50 between the IFA and the plaque assay could be explained
by their different principle of SARS-CoV-2 detection. The IFA requires the specific antibody to
detect the SARS-CoV-2 nucleoprotein derived from the complete virions and sub-viral particles
within the host cells, while the plaque assay measures the infectivity of complete virions released
from the host cells. Accordingly, it was not surprising that the IC50 of the IFA was higher than the
plaque assay. Since the IC50 of the plaque assay is the standard measure to interpret antiviral
potency of the compound of interest, the IC50 based on the plaque assay of 0.036 µg/mL for A.
paniculata and 0.034 µM for andrographolide were applied for data interpretation.
Cytotoxicity profiles of A. paniculata extract and andrographolide
One of the main concerns in medicinal plant-derived drug development is herb-induced
injury of the vital organs, especially the liver. To address this issue, six human cell lines which
represent five major organs including liver (HepG2 and imHC), kidney (HK-2), intestine (Caco2), lung (Calu-3) and brain (SH-SY5Y) were applied to evaluate the cytotoxicity profiles of A.
paniculata extract and andrographolide by MTT assay. The results showed that A. paniculata
extract had no cytotoxicity to all cell lines examined with the CC50 of >100 µg/mL (Figure 4A4F). Considering the antiviral effect with the IC50 of 0.034 µM andrographolide (Figure 3F), this
diterpene lactone showed considerably low-to-no cytotoxic effects on HepG2, imHC, HK-2, Caco2 and Calu-3 with the CC50 of 81.52, 44.55, 34.11, 52.30 and 58.03 µM, and the selectivity index
(SI) of 2398, 1310, 1003, 1538 and 1707, respectively (Figure 4G-4K). Andrographolide treated
SH-SY5Y had the CC50 of 13.19 µM and the relatively narrower SI of 388 (Figure 4L). The
schematic diagram summarized the IC50 and the CC50 values of A. paniculata extract and
andrographolide is shown in Figure 5.

Figure 4. Cytotoxicity profiles of A. paniculata extract and Andrographolide over six cell
lines representing human major organ. After 48 h treatment of (A) A. paniculata extract and
(B) andrographolide in various cell lines representing liver (HepG2, imHC), kidney (HK-2),
intestine (Caco-2), lung (Calu-3), and brain (SH-SY5Y), MTT assay was applied to evaluate the
cytotoxicity effect. All experiments were performed in three biological replicates.

This finding pointed out that further development of A. paniculata extract and
andrographolide in preclinical models of COVID-19 should pay attention to the neurologic side
effects as well as the amount of andrographolide that pass through the blood brain barrier. In this
regard, the BOILED-egg plot using SwissADME program was performed for in silico prediction
of the probability of compounds being gastrointestinal absorption and barrier penetration.34, 35
Based on this prediction, andrographolide is a gastrointestinal absorbable compound without an
ability to pass through the blood-brain barrier (Supplementary Figure 1). The SwissADME
prediction also reveals that andrographolide is a P-glycoprotein (P-gp) substrate,36 suggesting that
andrographolide would be “pumped out” from central nervous system (CNS) tissues and may not
pose a significant neurotoxicity if used in further studies.
Potential clinical applications of A. paniculata extract and andrographolide
Andrographis paniculata has classified as an essential plant for traditional medicine in
various Asian countries for centuries.37 In Thailand, the Ministry of Public Health has registered
this plant, so-called Fah Talai Jone, to The National List of Essential Drugs A.D. 1999 (List of
Herbal Medicinal Products).38 A. paniculata extract has long been available in Thailand’s markets
as the herbal nutraceuticals in several recipes and brands, in which general population can access
and use to treat diarrhea, fever, common cold and viral infection. It is postulated that beneficial
effects of A. paniculata extract largely depended on its major component andrographolide, the
bicyclic diterpene lactone with multi-functionalities including anticancer, antioxidant, antiinflammatory, immunomodulatory, cardiovascular protection and hepatoprotection, antimicrobial,
antiprotozoal.37, 39-42
Andrographolide is also well-known for its broad spectrum antiviral properties.24 Studies
showed andrographolide has been effective against influenza A,43 hepatitis C virus,44 Chikungunya
virus,40 HIV,45 hepatitis B virus,46 Herpes simplex virus 1,47 Epstein-Barr virus,48 and human
papillomavirus.49 This study showed that both A. paniculata extract and its active component

andrographolide had potent inhibitory effect against SARS-CoV-2. This finding opens a
possibility to develop A. paniculata extract and andrographolide in the context of COVID-19
treatment. In comparison to our previous study,30 A. paniculata extract and andrographolide
exhibited the equivalent IC50 against SARS-CoV-2 infection to remdesivir30 (Table 1). This is an
additional rationale to support A. paniculata extract and especially andrographolide for further
antiviral development.
It has been proposed that andrographolide involves at multiple steps of viral life cycle
including viral entry, genetic material replication, protein synthesis and inhibit the expression or
function of the mature proteins.24 Previous studies suggested andrographolide targeted nonstructural proteins of SARS-CoV-2 as the mechanism of action. Enzyme-based assay and in silico
modelling prediction showed andrographolide could inhibit the main protease (Mpro) activities of
SARS-CoV-2 with the IC50 of 15 µM.26, 29 In addition, Maurya, VK, et al.,50 showed that
andrographolide has significant binding affinity towards spike glycoprotein of both SARS-CoV-2
and ACE2 receptor and could be develop as a prophylactic agent for limiting viral entry into the
host cells. In our study, andrographolide inhibited SARS-CoV-2 at the viral replication and viral
release as evidenced from the high-content imaging IFA and viral output study using plaque assay
(Figure 2). This finding highlighted andrographolide as a potential monotherapy, even though the
combinational regimens should be prioritized to increasing the efficacy and reducing the side
effects/toxicities.
This study associated with several limitations. Although our findings support
andrographolide as a promising candidate for further anti-SARS-CoV-2 development, the low
bioavailability of andrographolide might pose a limitation for clinical applications.51, 52 Several
strategies have been developed to improve andrographolide solubility and bioavailability, i.e.,
forming complexes with hydroxypropyl-β-cyclodextrin (HP-β-CD),53 solid dispersion using a
spray-drying technique,54 and loading into the nano-emulsion.55 Also, it should be noted that this
study was conducted using in vitro cellular model. The safety and efficacy of andrographolide
should be further investigated in preclinical animal models and clinical studies.
In conclusion, this study demonstrated anti-SARS-CoV-2 activity of A. paniculata and
andrographolide using Calu-3-based anti-SARS-CoV-2 assay. Potent anti-SAR-CoV-2 activities,
together with the favorable cytotoxicity profiles, support further development of A. paniculata
extract and especially andrographolide as a monotherapy or in combination with other effective
drugs against SARS-CoV–2 infection.
