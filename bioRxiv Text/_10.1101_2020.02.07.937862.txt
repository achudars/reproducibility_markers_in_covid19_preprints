Abstract
The present outbreak of lower respiratory tract infections, including respiratory distress
syndrome, is the third spillover, in only two decades, of an animal coronavirus to humans
resulting in a major epidemic. Here, the Coronavirus Study Group (CSG) of the International
Committee on Taxonomy of Viruses, which is responsible for developing the official
classification of viruses and taxa naming (taxonomy) of the Coronaviridae family, assessed the
novelty of the human pathogen tentatively named 2019-nCoV. Based on phylogeny, taxonomy
and established practice, the CSG formally recognizes this virus as a sister to severe acute
respiratory syndrome coronaviruses (SARS-CoVs) of the species Severe acute respiratory
syndrome-related coronavirus and designates it as severe acute respiratory syndrome
coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). To facilitate communication, the CSG further proposes to use the
following naming convention for individual isolates: SARS-CoV-2/Isolate/Host/Date/Location.
The spectrum of clinical manifestations associated with SARS-CoV-2 infections in humans
remains to be determined. The independent zoonotic transmission of SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV2 highlights the need for studying the entire (virus) species to complement research focused on
individual pathogenic viruses of immediate significance. This research will improve our
understanding of virus-host interactions in an ever-changing environment and enhance our
preparedness for future outbreaks.

Is the human coronavirus that emerged in Asia in December 2019 novel?
Is the outbreak of an infectious disease caused by a new or a previously known virus (Box 1)?
This is among the first and principal questions because the answer informs measures to detect
the causative agent, control its transmission and limit potential consequences of the epidemic.
It also has implications for the virus name. On a different time scale, the answer also helps to
define research priorities in virology and public health.
The questions of virus novelty and naming are now posed in relation to a coronavirus causing
an outbreak of a respiratory syndrome that was first detected in Wuhan, China, December
2019. It was temporally named 2019 novel coronavirus, 2019-nCoV. The term “novel” may refer
to the disease (or spectrum of clinical manifestations) that is caused in humans infected by this
particular virus, which, however, is only emerging and requires further studies1,2. The term
“novel” in the name of 2019-nCoV may also refer to an incomplete match between the
genomes of this and other (previously known) coronaviruses, if the latter was considered an
appropriate criterion for defining “novelty”. However, virologists agree that neither the disease
nor the host range can be used to reliably ascertain virus novelty (or identity), since few
genome changes may attenuate a deadly virus or cause a host switch3. Likewise, we know that
RNA viruses persist as a swarm of co-evolving closely related entities (variants of a defined
sequence, haplotypes), known as quasispecies4,5. Their genome sequence is a consensus
snapshot of a constantly evolving cooperative population in vivo and may vary within a single
infected person6 and over time in an outbreak7. If the strict match criterion of novelty was to be
applied to RNA viruses, it would have qualified every virus with a sequenced genome as a novel
virus, which makes this criterion poorly informative. To get around the potential problem,
virologists instead may regard two viruses with non-identical but similar genome sequences as
variants of the same virus; this immediately poses the question of how much difference is large
enough to recognize the candidate virus as novel or distinct? This question is answered in best
practice by evaluating the degree of relatedness of the candidate virus to previously known
viruses of the same host or established monophyletic groups of viruses, often known as
genotypes or clades, which may or may not include viruses of different hosts. This is formally
addressed in the framework of virus taxonomy (Box 2).
In this study, we present an assessment of the novelty of 2019-nCoV and detail the basis for
(re)naming this virus severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2, SARS-CoV-2, which will
be used hereafter.

Defining novelty and the place of SARS-CoV-2 within the taxonomy of the Coronaviridae
family
During the 21st century, researchers studying coronaviruses – a family of enveloped positivestranded RNA viruses of vertebrates8 – were confronted several times with the question of
coronavirus novelty, including two times when a severe or even life-threatening disease was
introduced into humans from a zoonotic reservoir: this happened with severe acute respiratory

syndrome (SARS)9-12 and, a few years later, with Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS)13,14.
Each time, the pathogen was initially called a new human coronavirus, as was the case with
SARS-CoV-2 during the current outbreak, every time the issue was resolved by the sequencebased family classification.
The current classification of coronaviruses includes taxa at eight out of the fifteen available
ranks15, and it recognizes forty-nine species in twenty-seven subgenera, five genera and two
subfamilies that belong to the family Coronaviridae, suborder Cornidovirineae, order
Nidovirales, realm Riboviria16-18. The family classification and taxa naming (taxonomy) are
developed by the Coronavirus Study Group (CSG), a working group of the International
Committee on Taxonomy of Viruses (ICTV)19. The CSG has responsibility in assessing the novelty
of viruses through their relation to known viruses in established taxa and, for the purpose of
this paper, specifically in the context of the species Severe acute respiratory syndrome-related
coronavirus.
To appreciate the difference between Severe acute respiratory syndrome-related coronavirus
and SARS-CoV, i.e. between species and virus, it may be instructive to look at their relation in
the context of the full taxonomy structure of several coronaviruses and in comparison with the
taxonomy of the virus host, specifically humans (Fig. 1). Thus, SARS-CoV-Urbani with a
particular genome sequence20 could be regarded as equivalent to a single human being, while
the species Severe acute respiratory syndrome-related coronavirus would be on a par with the
species Homo sapiens. This parallel could go beyond semantics and be biologically meaningful
because of how coronaviruses are assigned to species in practice, although the extension of this
concept to virology is yet to be developed and thoroughly tested21.
Even without knowing anything on the species concept of classifying different forms of life,
every human recognizes another human as being a member of the (same) species Homo
sapiens. However, for assigning individual living organisms to most other species, specialized
knowledge and tools for assessing inter-individual differences are required. The CSG uses a
computational framework of comparative genomics22 that is shared by several Study Groups
concerned with the classification and nomenclature of the order Nidovirales and coordinated
by the Nidovirales Study Group23 (Box 3). The Study Groups quantify and partition the variation
in the most conserved replicative proteins encoded in open reading frames 1a and 1b
(ORF1a/1b) of the coronavirus genome (Fig. 2A) to identify thresholds on pair-wise patristic
distances (PPD) that demarcate virus clusters at different ranks.
SARS-CoV-2 clusters with SARS-CoVs in trees of the species Severe acute respiratory syndromerelated coronavirus (Fig. 2B) and genus Betacoronavirus (Fig. 2C), as was also reported by
others24-26. Distance estimates between SARS-CoV-2 and the most closely related coronaviruses
vary among different studies, depending on the choice of measure (nucleotide or amino acid)
and genome region. Accordingly, researchers are split about the exact taxonomic position of
2019-nCoV (i.e., SARS-CoV-2). When we included SARS-CoV-2 in the dataset, including 2505
coronaviruses and used for the most recent update (May 2019) of the coronavirus taxonomy

that is currently being considered by ICTV18, the species composition was not affected and the
virus was assigned to the species Severe acute respiratory syndrome-related coronavirus, as
detailed below.
The species demarcation threshold/limit in the family Coronaviridae is defined/imposed by
viruses whose PPD may cross the inter-species demarcation threshold. Due to their minute
share of ~10-4 of the total number of all intra- and inter-species PPDs, they may not even be
visually recognized in a conventional diagonal plot clustering viruses on species basis (Fig. 3A).
Furthermore, these violators do not involve any virus of the species Severe acute respiratory
syndrome-related coronavirus species, as evident from the analysis of maximal intraspecies
PPDs of 2505 viruses of all 49 coronavirus species (Fig. 3B) and PDs of 256 viruses of this species
(Fig. 4). Thus, the genomic variation of the known viruses of this species is smaller compared to
that of other comparably well sampled species, e.g. those prototyped by MERS-CoV, HCoVOC43 and IBV (Fig. 3B), and this species is well separated from other known coronavirus species
in the sequence space. Both these characteristics of the species Severe acute respiratory
syndrome-related coronavirus facilitate the unambiguous species assignment of SARS-CoV-2 to
this species.
Intra-species PDs of SARS-CoV-2 belong to the top 25% of this species and also include the
largest PD, that between SARS-CoV-2 and an African bat virus isolate (SARSr-CoV_BtKY72)27
(Fig. 4), representing two basal lineages within the species Severe acute respiratory syndromerelated coronavirus that constitute very few known viruses (Fig. 2BC). These relationships stand
in contrast to the shallow branching of the most populous lineage of this species which includes
all the human SARS-CoV isolates collected during the 2002-2003 outbreak and the closely
related bat viruses of Asian origin identified in the search for the potential zoonotic source of
that epidemic28. (Note that this clade structure is susceptible to homologous recombination,
which is common in this species29 28,30; to formalize clade definition, it must be revisited after
the virus sampling of the deep branches was improved sufficiently). The current sampling
defines a very small median PD for human SARS-CoVs, which is approximately 15 times smaller
than the median PD determined for SARS-CoV-2 (0.16% vs 2.6%, Fig. 4). This small median PD of
human SARS-CoVs also dominates the species-wide PD distribution (0.25%, Fig. 4). Along with
the initial failure to detect the causative agent of the disease using SARS-CoV-specific PCR
setups, the separation from SARS-CoV in the phylogeny and the PD space explains why 2019nCoV (SARS-CoV-2) may be considered a novel virus by many researchers.

Designating 2019-nCoV as SARS-CoV-2 and providing guidance for naming its variants
The above results show that, in terms of taxonomy, SARS-CoV-2 is (just) another virus in the
species Severe acute respiratory syndrome-related coronavirus. In this respect, the discovery of
this virus differs considerably from the description of the two other zoonotic coronaviruses,
SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, introduced to humans in the 21st century (Fig. 5A). Both these viruses
were considered novel by this study group based on prototyping two species and two informal

subgroups of the Betacoronavirus genus that were recently recognized as subgenera
Sarbecovirus and Merbecovirus17,31,32. Due to being first, these viruses and their taxa were
assigned new names whose origins reflected the practice and the state of virus taxonomy at the
respective times (Fig. 5B) (Box 4). Neither of these circumstances are applicable to SARS-CoV-2,
which is assigned to an existing species of hundreds of known viruses predominantly isolated
from humans and diverse bats. All these viruses have names derived from SARS-CoV (directly or
through the species name), even though only the human isolates collected during the 20022003 outbreak have been confirmed to cause SARS in infected individuals. Thus, the reference
to SARS in all these virus names (combined with the use of specific prefixes, suffixes and/or
genome sequence IDs in public databases) acknowledges the phylogenetic grouping of the
respective virus with viruses isolated from SARS patients, for example SARS-CoV-Urbani, rather
than linking this virus to a specific disease (i.e., SARS) in humans. Based on the established
practice of virus naming in this species and the relatively distant relationship of SARS-CoV-2 to
the prototype SARS-CoV in a species tree and the distance space (Figs. 2B, and 4), the CSG
renames 2019-nCoV to SARS-CoV-2.
In contrast to SARS-CoV, the name SARS-CoV-2 has NOT been derived from the name of the
SARS disease (Fig. 5B), and in no way, it should be used to predefine the name of the disease
(or spectrum of diseases) caused by SARS-CoV-2 in humans, which will be decided upon by the
WHO. The available yet limited epidemiological and clinical data for SARS-CoV-2 suggest that
the disease spectrum, and transmission modes of this virus and SARS-CoV may differ1. Also, the
diagnostic methods used to confirm SARS-CoV-2 infections are not identical to those of SARSCoV. This is reflected by the specific recommendations for public health practitioners,
healthcare workers and laboratory diagnostic staff for SARS-CoV-2/2019-nCoV (e.g. WHO
guidelines for 2019-nCoV; https://www.who.int/emergencies/diseases/novel-coronavirus2019). By uncoupling the naming conventions used for coronaviruses and the diseases they may
cause in humans and animals, we wish to help the WHO with naming diseases in the most
appropriate way (WHO guidelines for disease naming;
https://apps.who.int/iris/handle/10665/163636) (Fig. 5B).
To facilitate good practice and scientific exchange, the CSG recommends that researchers
describing new isolates of this virus and other viruses in this species adopt a standardized
format for public databases and publications. The proposed naming convention includes a
reference to the host organism that the virus was isolated from, the time of isolation, and the
place of isolation (geographic location): Virus/Isolate/Host/Date/Location, e.g. SARS-CoV2/X1/Human/2019/Wuhan. This complete designation along with additional and important
characteristics, such as association with pathogenicity in humans or other hosts, should be
included in the submission of each isolate genome sequence to public databases, e.g. GenBank.
In publications, this name could be further extended with a sequence database ID, e.g. SARSCoV-2/X1/Human/2019/Wuhan_XYZ12345, when first mentioned in the text. We believe that
this format will inform about the major characteristics of each particular virus isolate (genome

sequence) that are critical for subsequent epidemiological and other studies, as well as control
measures.

Concluding remarks: from focusing on pathogens to understanding virus species
Historically, public health and fundamental research have been focused on the detection,
containment, treatment and analysis of viruses that are pathogenic to humans, with little
regard to exploring and defining their genetic diversity and biological characteristics as a
species. In this framework, the emergence of SARS-CoV-2 as a human pathogen in December
2019 may be perceived as completely independent from the SARS-CoV outbreak in 2002-2003.
Although SARS-CoV-2 is NOT a descendent of SARS-CoV (Fig. 2B) and the introduction of each
of these viruses into humans was likely facilitated by unknown external factors, the two viruses
are genetically so close to each other (Fig. 2C) that their evolutionary histories and
characteristics are mutually informative. Our understanding of these pathogens could be
significantly advanced if both viruses were characterized along with viruses of other origins,
known and yet-to-be discovered25, as part of the Severe acute respiratory syndrome-related
coronavirus species, with the long-term goal of comprehending the biology and evolution of
that species, as is the norm elsewhere in biology. To connect this development to health care,
diagnostic tools that target the entire species should complement existing tools that detect
individual pathogenic variants.
Although this paper focuses on a single virus species, the raised issues concern other species in
the family and possibly beyond. As a first step toward appreciation of this species and its
cousins, researchers, journals, databases, and other relevant bodies should adopt proper
referencing to the full taxonomy of coronaviruses under study. This includes that the relevant
virus species is explicitly acknowledged along with the viruses included in this species by
following the ICTV naming rules (Box 4) which, regretfully, are rarely observed in common
practice, contributing to the proliferation of mixing viruses and species in the literature (and the
authors of this paper wish to acknowledge that they were also not immune to this problem in
several cases). This necessary adjustment may be facilitated by the major revision of the virus
species nomenclature that is currently being discussed by ICTV and planned to be implemented
in the near future33. With this change in place, the CSG is resolved to address the existing
significant overlap between virus and species names that complicates the appreciation and use
of the species concept in its application to coronaviruses.

Box 1. Virus Discovery: from disease-based to phenotype-free
Understanding the cause of a specific disease that spreads among individuals of the same
biological species (infectivity) was the major driving force for the discovery of the first virus,
initially in plants, and many others in all types of life, including humans. The range of
diseases and hosts that specific viruses were confirmed to be associated with have been the

two key and most appreciated characteristics used to define viruses that are invisible to the
naked eye due to their minute size34. They belong to the so-called phenotype of viruses,
which includes those that – like a disease – are shaped by virus-host interactions, e.g.
transmission rate or immune correlates of protection, and others that are virus-specific, e.g.
the architecture of virus particles. These phenotypic features are of critical importance for
many decisions and actions related to medically and economically important viruses,
especially during outbreaks of severe infectious diseases, and they dominate the general
perception of viruses.
However, the host is not definitive nor is the pathogenicity known for a major (and fast
growing) share of viruses, including many coronaviruses discovered in metagenomics
studies using next generation sequencing technology35,36. These studies analyze diverse
environmental specimens and assemble genomic sequence of viruses, which circulate in
nature and have never been characterized on the phenotypic level. Thus, the genome
sequence is the only characteristic that is known for the vast majority of viruses, and its use
in defining virus identity in the virosphere is the only available choice going forward. In this
framework, a virus is defined by its genome sequence that instructs the synthesis of
polynucleotide molecules capable of autonomous replication inside cells and dissemination
between cells or organisms under appropriate conditions. It may or may not be harmful to
its natural host. Experimental studies may be performed for a fraction of known viruses,
while computational comparative genomics is used to classify (and deduce characteristics
of) all viruses.

Box 2. Recognizing virus novelty
Besides haplotypes of a virus quasispecies, the terms strains and isolates are in common use
to refer to virus variants with larger genome variations, although there are different
opinions as to which term should be used in a specific context. If a candidate virus clusters
within a group of isolates, it is a variant of this group and, in other words, may be
considered a known virus. On the other hand, if the candidate virus is outside of known
groups and its distances to viruses of these groups are comparable to those observed
between viruses of different groups (intergroup distances), the candidate virus is distinct
and could be considered novel. Commonly this evaluation is conducted in silico using
phylogenetic analysis that may be complicated by uneven rates of evolution that vary across
different virus lineages and genomic sites due to mutation, including exchange of genome
regions in closely related viruses (homologous recombination). Comparative genomics
forms also the basis for PCR assays that are suitable to detect established viruses and their
groups in vitro. If such PCRs do not recognize the candidate virus, it may be considered
novel. There are two caveats to the above approaches. Since the current sampling of viruses
is small and highly biased toward viruses of significant medical and economic interest, the
group composition varies tremendously among different viruses, making decisions on
novelty group-specific and dependent on the choice of specific criteria selected by

researchers. Practically, this means that definitive evidence for novelty in one group may
not stand up to scrutiny in another.
The challenges mentioned above are addressed specifically in the framework of virus
taxonomy, which partitions genomic variation above strain/isolate level and develops a
unique taxa nomenclature under the supervision of the ICTV21,37. To decide on virus novelty,
taxonomists use the results of different analyses, although comparative sequence analysis
plays an increasing role and is now the primary tool in the classification of coronaviruses
(Box 3). Taxonomical classification is hierarchical, using nested groups (taxa) that populate
different levels (ranks) of classification. Taxa of different ranks differ in respect to intrataxon pairwise divergence, which increases from the smallest at the species rank to the
largest at the realm rank. They may also be distinguished by taxon-specific markers that
characterize natural groupings. When classifying a virus, researchers are required to define
and name taxa only on the species and genus ranks while filling other ranks is optional.
Thus, species is the smallest and mandatory unit of virus taxonomy. Only if a virus
prototypes a new species, it will be regarded as truly novel, taxonomy-wise. Within this
framework, a virus that crosses a host barrier and acquires novel properties remains part of
the original species. This association may persist even after the virus established a
permanent circulation in the new host, as it likely happened with coronaviruses of four
species circulating in humans (reviewed in38).

Box 3. Classifying coronaviruses
In the past, the classification of coronaviruses was largely based on serologic (cross-)
reactivity involving the S protein till it became based on comparative sequence analysis of
replicative proteins. The choice of proteins and the methods used to analyze them have
gradually evolved since the start of this century19,31,32,39. Currently, the CSG analyzes 3CLpro,
NiRAN, RdRp, ZBD and HEL140 (Fig. 2A), which replaced the seven domains used for analysis
between 2009 and 201517. According to our current knowledge, these five most essential
domains are the only domains that are conserved in all viruses of the order Nidovirales;
they are used for the classification by all nidovirus SGs (coordinated by the NSG).
Since 2011, the classification of coronaviruses and other nidoviruses has been assisted by
the DEmARC (DivErsity pArtitioning by hieRarchical Clustering) software which defines taxa
and ranks22. Importantly, the involvement of all coronavirus genome sequences available at
the time of analysis allows family-wide designations of demarcation criteria for all ranks,
including species, regardless of the taxa sampling size, be it a single or hundreds of virus(es).
DEmARC delineates monophyletic clusters (taxa) of viruses, using weighted linkage
clustering in the pairwise patristic distance (PPD) space and according to the classification
ranks defined through clustering cost (CC) minima presented as PPD thresholds. The
persistence of thresholds in the face of increasing virus sampling is interpreted in the
DEmARC framework as a reflection of biological forces and environmental factors41.

Specifically, homologous recombination, which is common in coronaviruses42-44, is believed
to be restricted in the most essential proteins, like those used for classification, to within a
species. This restriction promotes intra-species diversity and contributes to inter-species
separation; hence, they are biological entities, which deviates from the current ICTV
definition of virus species as man-made constructs 21. To facilitate the use of rank
thresholds outside the DEmARC framework, they are converted into pair-wise differences
(PD) %, which researchers commonly use to arrive at a tentative assignment of a given virus
within the coronavirus taxonomy following conventional phylogenetic analysis of selected
viruses.

Box 4. Naming Viruses and Virus Species: roles of ICTV and WHO
Besides humans and their pets, viruses may be the only biological entities that have names
for virtually every single known representative, in addition to the groups (taxa) that
together constitute the official classification of virus taxonomy. This exceptional treatment
of viruses is a by-product of the historical perception of viruses as a feature of the diseases
they cause (Box 1) and the way we usually catalogue and classify newly discovered viruses,
rather than an expression of appreciation of virus individuality. Apart from disease, also
geography and the organism a given virus was isolated from dominate the name
vocabulary, occasionally engraving connections that may be accidental (rather than typical)
to the virus in nature. Virus naming is linked to the recognition of virus novelty (Box 2),
which is not formally regulated; and no national or global authorities have been established
to certify virus novelty and approve virus names. Thus, it is mainly up to virus discoverers or
other researchers to decide on these matters, and it is not uncommon to see two variants
of the same virus having very different names, if they were described by different
researchers.
One of the priorities of the World Health Organization (WHO), an agency of the United
Nations, is concerned with communicable diseases, including the coordination of
international public health activities aimed at containing (and mitigating the consequences
of) major virus epidemics. WHO also considers virus novelty and has responsibility in
naming the disease(s) caused by newly emerging human viruses. By doing so, WHO often
takes the traditional approach of linking viruses to specific diseases (Box 1) and assessing
novelty by an apparent failure to detect the causative agent by established diagnostic
assays. Formally, ICTV was involved in virus naming only until the grouping of the most
closely related viruses into clusters (taxa species) was introduced and their nomenclature in
the taxonomy established 45. Since then, the specialized Study Groups have been involved in
virus naming only on a case-by-case basis as an extension of their official remit and using
the special expertise of their members. However, since the study groups are responsible for
assigning viruses to virus species, they could play an important role in advancing the species
concept (which is yet to be fully appreciated) to the research community and others, who
may be uncertain about its significance 21. The CSG adopts the DEmARC-based approach to
define virus species (Box 3). Practically, virus species are often ignored or confused with
viruses that are part of the respective species. This problem may be alleviated by strictly

Figure Legends
Fig. 1. Taxonomies of coronaviruses and humans. Shown is a comparison of the taxonomies of
selected coronaviruses and the founders of virology for the shared taxonomic categories. Note
that these two taxonomies are independently developed using completely different criteria.
Fig. 2. Phylogeny of coronaviruses. (A) Concatenated MSAs of the protein domain combination
used for phylogenetic and DEmARC analyses of the Coronaviridae family. Shown are the
locations of the replicative domains conserved in the Nidovirales order (5d, 5 domains: 3CLpro,
3C-like protease; NiRAN, nidovirus RdRp-associated nucleotidyltransferase; RdRp, RNAdependent RNA polymerase; HEL1, superfamily 1 helicase with upstream Zn-binding domain
(ZBD)) in relation to several other ORF1a/b-encoded domains and other major open reading
frames in the SARS-CoV genome. (B) The Maximum-Likelihood (ML) tree of the species Severe
acute respiratory syndrome-related coronavirus was reconstructed by IQ‑Tree 1.6.1 using 83
sequences with the best fitting evolutionary model. Subsequently, the tree was purged from
the most similar sequences and midpoint-rooted. Branch support was estimated using the
Shimodaira-Hasegawa-like approximate likelihood ratio test (SH-aLRT) with 1000 replicates.
GenBank IDs for all viruses except four are shown; SARS-CoV, AY274119.3; SARS-CoV-2
MN908947.3; SARSr-CoV_BtKY72, KY352407.1; SARS-CoV_PC4-227, AY613950.1. (C) Shown is
an IQ‑Tree ML tree of single virus representatives of thirteen species and four representatives
of the species Severe acute respiratory syndrome-related coronavirus, genus Betacoronavirus.
The tree is rooted with HCoV-NL63 and HCoV-229E, representing two species of the genus
Alphacoronavirus. Red, zoonotic viruses with varying pathogenicity in humans; orange,
common respiratory viruses that circulate in humans. Asterisk, ICTV approval for the two
coronavirus species with non-italicized names is pending.
Fig. 3. Species pairwise distance demarcation in the family Coronaviridae. (A) Diagonal matrix
of PPDs of 2505 viruses clustered according to 49 coronavirus species and ordered from the
most to the least populous species, from left to right; green and white, PPDs smaller and larger
than the inter-species threshold (panel B), respectively. Areas of the green squares along the
diagonal are proportional to the virus sampling of the respective species, and virus prototypes
of the five most sampled species are specified to the left; asterisk, selected species including
viruses whose some PPDs crossed threshold (“violators”). Violators of the inter-species
threshold appear as white dots on the green squares along the diagonal and green dots off the
diagonal, respectively; as there are just 656 dots of this kind (out of a total of 6,275,025 dots) in
the panel, they may not even be visible; this is an indication of the strong support for intraspecies virus clustering. (B) Maximal intra-species PPDs (X axis, linear scale) plotted against
virus sampling (Y axis, log scale) for 49 species (green dots) of the Coronaviridae. Indicated are
the acronyms of virus prototypes of the seven most sampled species. Green and blue plot
sections, intra-species and intra-subgenera PPD ranges. Vertical black line, inter-species
threshold.

Fig. 4. Pairwise distances between selected viruses within the species Severe acute
respiratory syndrome-related coronavirus. Shown are the PDs in % of non-identical residues (Y
axis) for four viruses representing three major phylogenetic lineages of the species (Fig. 2B) and
all pairs of the 256 viruses of this species (“All pairs”). The PD values were derived from the PPD
values (Fig. 3).
Fig. 5. Virus novelty and naming of the three zoonotic coronaviruses emerging in the first
decades of the 21st century. Year, indicates the year in which the virus was first identified. (A)
Independent assessments of virus novelty by the ICTV-CSG and WHO performed during the
three outbreaks came to different conclusions. Vertical arrows indicate the degree of virus
novelty according to taxonomy. (B) History of coronavirus naming during the three zoonotic
outbreaks in relation to virus taxonomy and disease (clinical manifestation).
