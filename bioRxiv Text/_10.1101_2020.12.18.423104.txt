Abstract
The newly emerged coronavirus, which was designated as severe acute respiratory syndrome
coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is the causative agent of the COVID-19 disease. High effective
and well-tolerated medication for hospitalized and non-hospitalized patients is urgently
needed. Traditional herbal medicine substances were discussed as promising candidates for
the complementary treatment of viral diseases and recently suggested for the treatment of
COVID-19. In the present study, we investigated aqueous licorice root extract for its
neutralizing activity against SARS-CoV-2 in vitro, identified the active compound glycyrrhizin
and uncovered the respective mechanism of viral neutralization. We demonstrated that
glycyrrhizin, the primary active ingredient of the licorice root, potently neutralizes SARS-CoV2 by inhibiting the viral main protease. Our experiments highlight glycyrrhizin as a potential
antiviral compound that should be further investigated for the treatment of COVID-19.

Main Manuscript
The newly emerged coronavirus, which was designated as severe acute respiratory syndrome
coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is the causative agent of the COVID-19 disease. Even
presymptomatic patients or patients with mild symptoms are able to infect other people. Highly
effective and well-tolerated medication for hospitalized and non-hospitalized patients is
urgently needed. Besides compounds that were initially approved for the treatment of other
viral infections such as remdesivir1, traditional herbal medicine substances were discussed as
promising candidates for the complementary treatment of viral diseases and recently
suggested for the treatment of COVID-19.
In the present study, we investigated aqueous licorice root extract for its neutralizing activity
against SARS-CoV-2 in vitro, identified the active compound glycyrrhizin and uncovered the
respective mechanism of viral neutralization.
Dried licorice roots were brewed in PBS at a concentration of 8 mg/ml (w/v) and the fluid was
subsequently sterile filtered to obtain an aqueous licorice root extract. The neutralization
capacity of licorice root extract was determined in cell culture by endpoint dilution. For this
purpose, serial dilutions of the licorice root extract (0.004 mg/ml – 4 mg/ml) were pre-incubated
with 100 TCID50 of SARS-CoV-2 for 1 hour at 37 °C and subsequently incubated on confluent
Vero E6 cells grown in 96-well microtiter plates (pre-entry approach). After 48 hours, the cells
were stained with crystal violet and analysed for plaque formation. Cytotoxicity was determined
at four distinct time points (5 minutes, 12 hours, 24 hours and 4 hours) by using the “Orangu
cell counting solution” (Cell guidance systems, Cambridge, United Kingdom), which is a WTS8 based assay using NAD(P)H concentration and dehydrogenase enzyme activity to detect
the cell vitality. The aqueous licorice root extract showed neutralizing effects even at a subtoxic
concentration of 2 mg/ml, (Figure 1A and B). This concentration is lower than the normal
consuming dilution e.g. in tea (12.5 mg/ml). Although licorice root tea may represent a good
candidate for complementary use, the identification and characterization of the active
compound is of great importance for a potential clinical application.

Glycyrrhizic acid is a triterpene saponin and found in high concentrations in the root of the
Glycyrrhiza glabra plant. It was described as an antiviral active ingredient of the licorice root
and exhibits antiviral activity against herpes simplex viruses2, the human immunodeficiency
virus as well as human and animal coronaviruses3. Lastly, an in-silico simulation study
proposed an antiviral activity of glycyrrhizin against SARS-CoV-2, but this hypothesis remains
experimentally unproved by now4. Based on our results with the aqueous licorice root extract,
we investigated the antiviral activity of glycyrrhizin acid against a clinical SARS-CoV-2 isolate
and subsequently examined the underlying mechanism of viral neutralization.
The neutralizing activity of glycyrrhizin against a clinical SARS-CoV-2 isolate was investigated
in cell culture. Here, glycyrrhizin acid ammonium-nitrate was dissolved in DMEM containing
2% (v/v) FCS and 1% penicillin–streptomycin at 37 °C and adjusted to pH 7. A potential
cytotoxic effect of glycyrrhizin was investigated as described above. No cytotoxic effect could
be observed even at a concentration of 4 mg/ml (Figure 1B). The neutralization capacity of
glycyrrhizin was determined by endpoint dilution. The antiviral activity against SARS-CoV-2
was analysed under pre- and post-entry conditions. Descending glycyrrhizin concentrations
(0.002 – 4 mg/ml) were pre-incubated with 100 TCID50 SARS-CoV-2 for 1 hour at 37°C (preentry condition) and subsequently added to confluent Vero E6 cells in 96-well microtiter plates
for 48 hours. In a second approach, Vero E6 cells were inoculated with 100 TCID50 SARSCoV-2 for 4 hours before the glycyrrhizin-containing inoculation medium with various
glycyrrhizin concentrations (0.002 – 4 mg/ml end-concentration) was added (post-entry
conditions). Complete virus neutralization was achieved at subtoxic concentrations of 0.5
mg/ml under pre- and 1 mg/ml under post-entry conditions (Figure 1A and B). To further
investigate the antiviral efficacy of glycyrrhizin, we determined the half-maximal effective
concentration (EC50) sufficient to neutralize the virus. Confluent Vero E6 cells grown in 6-well
plates were infected with 1000 TCID50 SARS-CoV-2 and at the same time treated with various
concentrations of glycyrrhizin ranging from 0.0625 to 4 mg/ml. After 48 hours of incubation, the
supernatants were harvested and the viral loads were determined by endpoint dilution. The
experiment was performed in triplicates. The EC50 was calculated with 0.44 mg/ml, uncovering

glycyrrhizin as a potent compound effective against SARS-CoV-2 (Figure 1C). The initial
finding was supported by quantifying the SARS-CoV-2 RNA from the supernatants of SARSCoV-2 infected cells treated with glycyrrhizin. Confluent Vero E6 cells grown in 24-well plates
were infected with 500 TCID50 and simultaneously treated with 1 mg/ml of glycyrrhizin.
Supernatants were collected at seven different time points (0 hours, 4 hours, 8 hours,
24 hours, 28 hours, 32 hours and 48 hours) post-infection. Viral RNA was purified from the
supernatants with the “High Pure Viral RNA Kit” (Roche Diagnostics) and the genomic SARSCoV-2 RNA was quantified by RT-qPCR. Therefore, primer targeting the viral M or N gene
were used. M and N gene copy numbers were assessed using a 1:10 plasmid dilution series
as reference (details and sequence information available upon request). Glycyrrhizin treatment
significantly reduced the genomic SARS-CoV-2 RNA levels (Figure 1D). Taken together, we
demonstrated that glycyrrhizin exhibited a high antiviral activity against SARS-CoV-2. Next,
we investigated the underlying mechanism how glycyrrhizin may interfere with the virus
replication. Recently, protease inhibitory activity of glycyrrhizin was predicted by in silico
simulations5. The human transmembrane serine protease (TMPRSS2) was shown to cleave
the SARS-CoV-2 Spike protein thereby facilitating the virus entry into the host cell6. However,
since there was only a slight difference in antiviral activity of glycyrrhizin between pre- and
post-entry conditions, and only a minor affinity was simulated for the interaction between
glycyrrhizin and TMPRSS2, we concluded that glycyrrhizin neutralizes the virus by a
mechanism different from inhibiting TMPRSS2. Thus, we focused on the SARS-CoV-2 main
protease (Mpro) as a potential target for glycyrrhizin7. Mpro is essential for processing the viral
polyproteins that are translated from the viral RNA and thus, for virus replication7. Glycyrrhizin
was suggested as a possible inhibitor of Mpro by in silico analysis, but this hypothesis has never
been experimentally proven5. Here we provide evidence that glycyrrhizin potently inhibits Mpro
activity in vitro. The inhibition of SARS-CoV-2 Mpro by glycyrrhizin was measured by using the
“3CL Protease, MBP-tagged (SARS-CoV-2) Assay Kit”. Briefly, 90 ng of recombinant Mpro were
incubated with two different concentrations of glycyrrhizin (30 µM and 2000 µM, dissolved in
water). As control, the protease inhibitor GC376 was used. The enzyme-sample solution was

incubated at room temperature for 30 minutes. The enzyme activity was measured at 360 nm
excitation and 460 nm emission after overnight incubation of the inhibitor-Mpro mixtures with
substrate (Dabcyl-KTSAVLQ↓SGFRKM-E(Edans)-NH2) at room temperature. Glycyrrhizin
completely inhibited Mpro activity at a concentration of 2000 µM (1.6 mg/ml) and reduced its
activity by 70.3% at a concentration of 30 µM (0.024 mg/ml).
Glycyrrhizin was clinically evaluated in the context of a clinical trial and described to be a safe
and well-tolerated compound8. The pharmacological effects include antioxidative and antiinflammatory, corticosteroid-like activities9. The potent antiviral activity as well as antiinflammatory properties highlight glycyrrhizin as an excellent candidate for further clinical
investigations in COVID-19 treatment. A case report described compassionate use of
glycyrrhizin among other potential antivirals for the treatment of COVID-1910. Although the
patient recovered from disease, further controlled studies are needed to prove the therapeutic
effects of glycyrrhizin in COVID-19.
Taken together, we demonstrated that glycyrrhizin, the primary active ingredient of the licorice
root, potently neutralizes SARS-CoV-2 by inhibiting the viral main protease. Our experiments
highlight glycyrrhizin as a potential antiviral compound that should be further investigated for
the treatment of COVID-19.

Figure 1: Antiviral efficacy of glycyrrhizin on the replication of SARS-CoV-2 in vitro.
A Decreasing aqueous licorice root extract dilutions (0.004 mg/ml – 4 mg/ml) were preincubated with 100 TCID50/ml SARS-CoV-2 for 1 hour at 37°C and applied to a confluent layer
of Vero E6 cells. After 48 hours of incubation, cell cultures were stained with crystal violet and
analysed for plaque formation. The antiviral activity against SARS-CoV-2 was analysed under
pre- and post-entry conditions. Descending glycyrrhizin concentrations (0.002 – 4 mg/ml) were
pre-incubated with 100 TCID50 SARS-CoV-2 for 1 hour at 37°C (pre-entry condition) and
subsequently added to confluent Vero E6 cells in 96-well microtiter plates for 48 hours. In a
second approach, Vero E6 cells were inoculated with 100 TCID50 SARS-CoV-2 for 4 hours
before the glycyrrhizin-containing inoculation medium with various glycyrrhizin concentrations
(0.002 – 4 mg/ml end-concentration) was added (post-entry conditions). Plaque formation was
evaluated after 48 hours post infection (p.i.). Bars represent 200 µm. B The toxicity of the
treatment was tested by using “Orangu cell counting solution”. Different concentrations were
incubated with a confluent layer of Vero E6 cells and evaluated at four time points (5 minutes,
12 hours, 24 hours, 48 hours). C Vero E6 cells were infected with 1000 TCID50/ 1.5 ml in
different glycyrrhizin concentrations for 48 hours. The supernatant was titrated on microtiter
plates in 1:10 dilutions to determine the viral loads in triplicates. The EC50 value was calculated
using GraphPad Prism 8.0.1 (Graph Pad Software, San Diego, USA). D SARS CoV-2 RNA
levels in supernatants of SARS-CoV-2 infected Vero E6 cells (500 TCID50) treated with 1 mg/ml
glycyrrhizin or mock treated were determined at seven time points (0, 4, 8, 24, 28, 32 and 48
hours) p.i. by quantive RT-qPCR. E The inhibition of SARS-CoV-2 Mpro by glycyrrhizin was
measured by using the “3CL Protease, MBP-tagged (SARS-CoV-2) Assay Kit” (BPS
Bioscience, San Diego, United States).
