Abstract
Patients with chronic lung disease (CLD) have an increased risk for severe coronavirus disease19 (COVID-19) and poor outcomes. Here, we analyzed the transcriptomes of 605,904 single
cells isolated from healthy and CLD lungs to identify molecular characteristics of lung cells that
may account for worse COVID-19 outcomes in patients with chronic lung diseases. We observed
a similar cellular distribution and relative expression of SARS-CoV-2 entry factors in control
and CLD lungs. CLD epithelial cells expressed higher levels of genes linked directly to the
efficiency of viral replication and innate immune response. Additionally, we identified basal
differences in inflammatory gene expression programs that highlight how CLD alters the
inflammatory microenvironment encountered upon viral exposure to the peripheral lung. Our
study indicates that CLD is accompanied by changes in cell-type-specific gene expression
programs that prime the lung epithelium for and influence the innate and adaptive immune
responses to SARS-CoV-2 infection.

Introduction
In December 2019, a respiratory disease associated with a novel coronavirus emerged in Wuhan,
China 1–3. The syndrome, now called COVID-19, was caused by severe acute respiratory
syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) and has since rapidly spread worldwide 4. As of
December 1, 2020, a total of over 63.4 million confirmed COVID-19 cases and more than 1.4
million deaths have been reported around the globe (https://coronavirus.jhu.edu/).
The clinical manifestations of SARS-CoV-2 infection range from asymptomatic to fulminant
cases of acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) and life-threatening multi-system organ
failure. Development of ARDS in patients with SARS-CoV-2 dramatically increases the risk of
ICU admission and death 5–11. Risk factors for severe SARS-CoV-2 include age, smoking status,
ethnicity and male sex 12–14. Baseline comorbidities including hypertension, diabetes and obesity,
increase SARS-CoV-2 susceptibility and severity 9,15–19. In addition, chronic lung disease (CLD)
has been identified as a risk factor for hospitalization and mortality in patients with COVID-19
20–27
. Patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) and interstitial lung disease
(ILDs), especially Idiopathic Pulmonary Fibrosis (IPF), have a significantly higher COVID-19
mortality rate compared to patients without chronic lung disease 28. However, the molecular
mechanisms underlying the increased risk of SARS-CoV-2 severity and mortality in patients
with pre-existing lung diseases are not well understood.
To investigate the molecular basis of SARS-CoV-2 severity and mortality risk in CLD patients,
we performed an integrated analysis of four lung single cell RNA-sequencing (scRNA-seq)
datasets 29–32 in addition to unpublished data, together including 78 control and 132 CLD
samples (n=31 COPD, 82 IPF and 19 other interstitial lung diseases). We found that CLD is
associated with baseline changes in cell-type specific expression of genes related to viral
replication and the immune response, as well as evidence of immune exhaustion and altered
inflammatory gene expression. Together, these data provide a molecular framework underlying
the increased risk of SARS-CoV-2 severity and poor outcomes in patients with certain preexisting CLD.

Results
Expression profile of SARS-CoV-2 associated receptors and factors in the diseased lung
To determine why COVID-19 patients with CLD have a higher risk of severe infection and
poorer outcomes, we performed an integrated analysis of the transcriptomes from 605,904 single
cells derived from healthy donors (78 samples), COPD (31 samples), IPF (82 samples) and NonIPF ILD (Other ILD, 19 samples) (Supplementary Table 1, 2). Using published cell type specific
markers 31,32, we identified 38 distinct cell types in the dataset (Supplementary Fig. 1,
Supplementary Table 3).
SARS-CoV-2 utilizes the host ACE2, and other putative factors such as BSG, NRP1 and HSPA5,
as entry receptor and TMPRSS2, CTSL or FURIN as priming proteases to facilitate cellular entry
33–40
. Consistent with prior reports analyzing normal lung tissue 33,34,41, ACE2 and TMPRSS2 are
expressed predominantly in epithelial cell types (Fig. 1a), while other putative SARS-CoV-2
entry receptors (BSG, NRP1, HSPA5) and priming proteases (CTSL, FURIN) have substantially
more widespread expression in nearly all cell types (Supplementary Fig. 2). The number of
ACE2+ cells is highest in type 2 alveolar cells (AT2) and secretory cells, while TMPRSS2 is
widely expressed in all epithelial cell types. There were no significant differences in the
proportion of ACE2+ cells in any cell-type in diseased versus control groups (Fig. 1b). The
proportion of TMPRSS2+ AT2 cells are decreased in IPF lungs while TMPRSS2+
SCGB3A2+/SCGB1A1+ club cells are in significantly higher numbers in COPD and IPF patients
compared to controls (Fig. 1c). The putative priming protease CTSL is expressed in more ciliated
cells, proliferating macrophages, fibroblasts and pericytes isolated from Other-ILD samples
(Supplementary Fig. 2).
Next, we compared the number of double positive cells, i.e. cells co-expressing a receptor and
priming protease, in control and disease samples. Interestingly, a notable fraction of cells coexpresses all established and putative entry receptors (ACE2, BSG, NRP1, HSPA5) and proteases
(TMPRSS2, CTSL, FURIN) (Fig. 1d, Supplementary Fig. 3). While the percentage of cells coexpressing ACE2 and priming proteases (TMPRSS2, CTSL, FURIN) was similar across disease
subtypes (Fig. 1e, Supplementary Fig. 3), there are significant differences in the number of cells
co-expressing BSG, NRP1, HSPA5 with a priming protease in disease samples in multiple cell
types (Fig. 1f, Supplementary Fig. 3). Interestingly, the number of BSG+/TMPRSS2+ and
NRP1+/TMPRSS2+ cells is significantly higher in the SCGB1A1+/SCGB3A2+ club cells
isolated from IPF samples.
To examine whether CLD patients express higher levels of SARS-CoV-2 receptors and priming
proteases, we performed differential expression analysis of those genes in the disease versus
control samples. The two major SARS-CoV-2 cellular entry factors, ACE2 and TMPRSS2, have

similar expression profiles in the disease and control samples. ACE2 expression is highest in
AT2 and Ciliated Cells, but there were no significant differences in ACE2 expression in disease
groups compared to control (Supplementary Fig. 4a). The putative alternative receptor NRP1,
recently confirmed as another host entry factor for SARS-CoV-235, is up-regulated in the COPD
macrophages, but down-regulated in both IPF and Other-ILD macrophages (Supplementary Fig.
5). TMPRSS2 expression is highest in AT2 cells, and is lower in the COPD samples
(Supplementary Fig. 4b), similar to a recent publication demonstrating decreased TMPRSS2
expression in severe COPD 42. Two alternative priming proteases (CTSL and FURIN) showed no
significant differences in expression between control and disease samples (Supplementary Fig.
4e, f). However, the SARS-CoV-2 entry gene score (calculated on the average expression levels
of all SARS-CoV-2 entry factors over a random control gene set) is significantly increased in the
disease samples in many epithelial cell types, including AT1, AT2, Basal and Club cells, but not
in KRT5-/KRT17+ cells, an ECM-producing epithelial cell type enriched in the fibrotic lung 31,32,
(Fig. 2b, Supplementary Fig. 6a,b). Together, these data suggest CLD is associated with only
modest changes in expression of established SARS-CoV-2 entry factors, and an alternative
mechanism likely is responsible for observed differences in outcome severity.

Dysregulation of viral infection and innate immune response genes in disease epithelial cells
Given the relatively modest differences in SARS-CoV-2 entry factors in epithelial cells between
diseased and control lungs (Supplementary Fig. 4, 5), we hypothesized that rather than greatly
increased cellular susceptibility to SARS-CoV-2 infection, patients with CLD are predisposed to
severe lung injury due to underlying differences in epithelial gene expression in key pathways
mediating the antiviral response. Epithelial cells isolated from diseased lungs expressed higher
levels of genes thought to directly impact viral replication (PIKFYVE, TPCN2) and the immune
response to viral infection (Fig. 2a). The complement pathway genes C3 and C4B, important
components of the innate immune response and previously found to be elevated in SARS
patients 43, are upregulated in diseased samples. Interestingly, key regulators of the host viral
response including cytokine and inflammatory response genes (IFN type I and type II receptors,
SOCS1/2, CCL2, CSF3, TRIM28, EIF2AK2) are also differentially expressed in diseased
epithelial cells. Additionally, autophagy (ATG5, ATG7, BECN1) and ER stress response
(EIF2AK3, ATF6, ERN1) genes which are well known to be aberrantly regulated in IPF lungs
were also upregulated in epithelial cells in other types of chronic lung disease; these pathways
are important for propagating viral infection and the host response 44–46.
In the distal lung, AT2 cells have been proposed to be the primary targets of SARS-CoV-2
34,41,47
. Thus, we examined the gene expression profile of diseased AT2 cells in more detail. As
described above, AT2 cells in all disease subgroups have significantly higher SARS-CoV-2 entry
gene scores than control cells (Fig. 2b). Additionally, genes involved in the complement
pathway, immune response and autophagy pathway are upregulated in diseased AT2 cells (Fig.
2a). COPD and Other-ILD, but not IPF, AT2 cells express higher levels of CSF3, an important
cytokine in the regulation of granulocytes (Fig. 2d). The epithelial integrin ITGB6, involved in
wound healing and pathogenic fibrosis 48, and the suppressors of cytokine signaling-1 and -2
(SOCS1, SOCS2) are upregulated in all disease AT2 cells (Fig. 2d, Supplementary Fig. 6). Gene
correlation analysis showed strong positive correlation between ADAM17, the main enzyme
responsible for ACE2 shedding, and ACE2, NRP1 but negatively correlated with BSG and
HSPA5 in the COPD and IPF samples (Fig. 2c, Supplementary Fig. 7). Interestingly, NRP1
expression is also positively correlated with the proteases TMPRSS2 and CTSL in the AT2 cells
isolated from IPF samples (Supplementary Fig. 7c). These data suggest that there are basal
differences in the expression profiles of genes regulating viral infection and the immune
response in diseased epithelial cells, specifically AT2 cells, and that this epithelial “priming”
may contribute to COVID-19 severity and poor outcomes.

Disease specific ACE2 correlated gene profiles in AT2 cells
Since ACE2 is the best-established SARS-CoV-2 entry factor, we sought to identify ACE2correlated genes in the ACE2+ AT2 cells in different disease groups. Thus, identifying the
immediate cellular environment SARS-CoV-2 encounters upon infecting a host. We performed
Spearman correlation analysis with Benjamini-Hochberg adjusted p-values and identified distinct
gene profiles significantly correlated with ACE2 for each disease group (Fig. 2e). There were
only three ACE2 correlated genes in the Control samples with a cut-off of 99th percentile
Spearman rho values and q-value less than 0.03, none of those genes are associated with the
immune response. In the disease samples, we identified 671 genes (COPD: 429 genes, IPF: 140
genes and Other-ILD: 102 genes) with significant correlation to ACE2 (99th percentile rho
values, q-value less than 0.03) (Supplementary Table 7). Interestingly, many ACE2-correlated
genes in the disease samples are associated with the innate and antiviral immune response. In the
COPD samples, genes with strong correlation coefficients with ACE2 include several interferoninduced genes (IFI6, IFI27, IFIT1, IFIT2, IFIT3), integrin beta 7 (ITGB7), a modulator of innate
immune function (OAS1), the chemokine receptor ACKR4 and a gene associated with West Nile
viral infection (OASL). In the IPF samples, ACE2 expression is strongly correlated with the
interferon-induced gene GBP6 (Guanylate Binding Protein Family Member 6), the interleukin
receptor IL31RA, and DDX17, a gene downstream of the IFN pathway. In other ILD diseases
(non-IPF related), the cytokine IL10, a member of the TGF-ߚ superfamily (NRTN), and an innate
immune pathway component (ITLN1) are among the genes with high correlation with ACE2.
Interestingly, IFIT3 and GBP4 (a member in the same gene family of GBP6) were shown to
correlate with ACE2 in asthma patients 49, while OAS1 was among the top 50 genes with a
significant correlation coefficient with ACE2 in a previous study 33. The presence of immuneassociated genes in these gene correlation profiles suggests that in patients with CLD, ACE2+
AT2 cells are conditioned and primed to express these genes to cope with viral infection.

Elevated ACE2 protein expression level in the small airway in IPF lungs
To further study the expression of the major SARS-CoV-2 entry factor ACE2 in the fibrotic
lungs, we examined the protein level of ACE2 in different lung regions. In agreement with the
transcript quantification above and previous immunohistology analysis 50, we detected overall
low expression level of ACE2 across all tissue types in both IPF (Fig. 3a-c) and control lung
sections (Supplementary Fig. 8a). Notably, semi-quantitative evaluation of ACE2 expression
scoring showed elevated ACE2 expression in all IPF sections compared to control, reaching
statistical significance in the IPF small airway sections (Fig. 3a, g), suggesting that while overall

ACE2 expression is low, there is a regional concentration of ACE2+ cells within the distal IPF
lung that may promote a more severe localized viral response. Upregulation of the epithelial
integrin alpha-V beta-6 (αvβ6) plays an important role in enhanced fibrosis in response to lung
injury 51, and enhances TGFβ activation which can suppress type I interferon responses from
alveolar macrophages increasing susceptibility to viral infection 52. We detected a significant
increase of αvβ6 integrin expression in all lung sections isolated from IPF patients (Fig. 3d-f, h).
While there was additional positive staining in the peripheral lung, αvβ6 expression is highest in
the AT2 epithelial cells in the IPF samples compared to overall low expression level in the
normal lung sections (Supplementary Fig. 8b), mirroring the expression data of ITGB6 described
above (Fig. 2d).
Baseline differences in inflammatory response programs in chronic lung disease
Recent publications have suggested that immune dysregulation, including sustained cytokine
production and hyper-inflammation, is associated with SARS-CoV-2 severity 53–56. We
performed in-depth examination of the immune cell population to determine whether preexisting immune dysregulation in chronic lung disease patients could contribute to SARS-CoV-2
severity and mortality. We analyzed a total of 418,891 cells from 13 immune cell types
(Supplementary Table 3, Supplementary Fig. 1) and found significant increases in the proportion
of CD4, CD8, cDCs and NK cells in the disease groups, most notably in COPD samples (Fig.
4a). Moreover, many immune cells isolated from disease samples expressed higher levels of
genes in the interferon pathway, IL6-related cytokine pathway (IL6ST, TGFB1, AREG) and
especially major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class II genes (HLA type II genes) (Fig.
4b). Expression of HLA type II genes increased across all disease groups but especially in the
Other-ILD samples, compared to controls (Fig. 4d). Type I IFN response (IFNa score) is slightly
elevated in the diseased macrophages and pDCs (Supplementary Fig. 9a). IL6-associated
tocilizumab responsive genes (IL6 score) are expressed at a higher level in the disease groups
IPF and Other-ILD, but lower in the COPD samples (Supplementary Fig. 9b). Previous studies
demonstrated elevated exhaustion levels in CD8 T cells in severely affected COVID-19 patients
57,58
. Notably, diseased immune cells, especially CD8 T cells and NK cells, have higher
expression levels of cytotoxicity and exhaustion genes compared to controls (Fig. 4e, f). These
perturbations in the T Cell population of diseased lungs may diminish the host immune response
to viral infection, leading to a higher risk of severe disease and poor outcomes in response to
SARS-CoV-2 infection.
To further investigate differences in immune cell type-specific gene expression profiles, we
examined expression levels of genes associated with viral infection in disease versus control
samples. Amphiregulin (AREG), a ligand for epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR), is
known to have essential roles in wound repair and inflammation resolution; furthermore,
upregulation of AREG is associated with viral infections of the lung 59. In COVID-19 patients,
AREG is significantly upregulated in PBMCs 60, monocytes, CD4 T Cells, NK cells, neutrophils

and DCs 56, suggesting that upregulation of AREG may be an attempt to ameliorate the severe
injury induced by SARS-CoV-2 infection. We observed reduced expression of AREG in the
cDCs and macrophages, but not in the monocytes, in the disease samples (Fig. 4c,
Supplementary Table 6, Supplementary Fig. 10). SOCS1, a suppressor of cytokine signaling, was
shown to reduce the type I IFN antiviral response in bronchial epithelial cells after influenza
infection 61,62. Expression of the chemokine CXCL8 and the IL6 co-receptor IL6ST was elevated
in COVID-19 patients 63,64. In our study, CXCL8 expression is lower in the disease samples in
cDCs, macrophages and monocytes while SOCS1 expression is elevated in disease samples in
these cell types (Fig. 4c, Supplementary Table 6). Interestingly, IL6ST expression level is
elevated significantly in COPD but reduced dramatically in Other-ILD samples (average twofold down-regulation compared to Control samples in all three cell types) (Fig. 4c,
Supplementary Table 6). These basal differences in inflammatory gene expression programs
highlight how chronic lung disease alters the inflammatory microenvironment encountered upon
viral exposure to the peripheral lung.

Discussion
The COVID-19 pandemic, caused by the SARS-CoV-2 virus, has affected tens of millions of
individuals around the globe in just the first nine months of 2020. Patients with CLD have an
increased risk for severe SARS-CoV-2 infection: COPD patients have a five-fold increased risk
of severe COVID-19 23,24,65–67 and ILD patients have up to a four-fold increased odds of death
from COVID-19 28,68. Here, we performed an integrated transcriptomic analysis of scRNA-seq
data from healthy and CLD patients to identify potential molecular causative factors determining
SARS-CoV-2 severity. To summarize the results: (1) ACE2 and TMPRSS2 are expressed
predominantly in epithelial cells and there are no significant differences in the number of ACE2+
cells in all cell types in disease compared to control samples; (2) a viral entry score including
multiple entry factors is increased in cells isolated from diseased lungs; (3) diseased epithelial
cells exhibit pre-existing dysregulation of genes involved in viral infection and the immune
response; (4) a unique ACE2 correlated gene profiles for each diagnosis group included anti-viral
and immune regulatory genes; (5) ACE2 protein levels are elevated in the IPF small airway
sections; (6) there are baseline differences in the cellular immune population in disease
compared to control samples.
Similar to other coronaviruses, SARS-CoV-2 utilizes cellular receptors (ACE2 and putatively,
BSG, NRP1 and HSPA5 gene products) and priming proteases (TMPRSS2, CTSL, FURIN), for
viral entry. These factors are expressed predominantly in the upper and lower airways, with
ACE2 being expressed highly in nasal goblet and ciliated cells and in a subset of AT2 cells and
the absorptive enterocytes in the gut 33,34,41,47,50. We observed a similar expression pattern of
ACE2 in our dataset, with AT2 cells having the highest number ACE2+ cells. To our knowledge,
publications investigating baseline expression of these SARS-CoV-2 entry factors in lung
disease have been limited to asthma and COPD with variable results. For example, studies in
asthma patients showed elevated expression of ACE2, TMPRSS2 and FURIN in patients with
severe but not mild-moderate asthma 49,69. Leung et al. performed bulk RNAseq and
immunohistochemical staining on bronchial epithelial cells and showed significantly elevated
expression levels of ACE2 and ACE2 protein in the small airways of COPD patients compared to
control 70. Another study on bronchoscopically isolated tissue showed no relationship between
disease status (mild to moderate asthma or COPD) on the expression levels of all SARS-CoV-2
entry factors 42. Our study utilized scRNAseq technology to study gene expression at a very
granular level and did not identify increased ACE2 expression at the single cell level in CLD,
including COPD. However, in the IPF lung, there was a regional concentration of ACE2+ cells
in the small airways upon immunohistochemical examination (Fig. 3a, g), similar to the findings
of Leung et al 70. While the overall frequency of ACE2+ cells and the ACE2 expression level
may be low, changes in the proportional cellular makeup of the diseased lung epithelium may
lead to a proportionate increase in ACE2+ “infectable” cells into the distal lung. Importantly, IPF
lungs exhibit abnormal expansion of epithelial cell programs, specifically the presence of more

proximal specific cell types in the distal lungs 31,32. Thus, our data along with previously
published studies together suggest that while overall differences in ACE2 expression and other
entry factors may be minimal in CLD, the localization of susceptible cells in the distal lung may
promote disease pathogenesis and severity.
A balanced immune response is crucial to viral clearance and avoidance of excessive injury to
the host, as evidenced by poor outcomes related both to immunosuppression as well as
hyperinflammation in COVID-19 patients71. COPD patients with severe COVID-19 had elevated
serum levels of various inflammatory cytokines including IL-2R, IL-6, IL-8, IL-10 and TNF-ߙ
suggesting there may be global alterations in the immune response 27.We observed that COPD
AT2 cells expressed elevated levels of immune-response related genes (CSF3, ITGB6, SOCS1,
SOCS2). G-CSF (encoded by CSF3) is found at high levels in patients with severe COVID-19
and thought to play a role in the hyperinflammatory syndrome while SOCS1 and SOCS2 are part
of a negative feedback system that regulates the response to cytokines 72,73. ACE2 correlated
genes in this cell population were enriched for regulators of the immune response (Fig. 2e), with
several of these genes found to be upregulated in alveolosphere cultures infected with SARSCoV-2 36. In addition to alterations in the cytokine microenvironment, changes in cellular
immune populations were also identified in the COPD samples, dysregulation of several genes in
inflammatory pathways (AREG, CCL3, CXCL8, SOCS1), and high levels of cytotoxic and
exhaustion-related genes in CD4 and CD8 T Cells from COPD lungs. Expression of cytotoxic
and exhaustion genes was increased compared to controls but similar in IPF and Other-ILD
immune cell types. Together, our data suggest that the immune microenvironment at both the
molecular and cellular level in the fibrotic and COPD lung is dysregulated and may promote
severe infection and poor outcomes in COVID-19.
One limitation of our study is that we focus mainly on the peripheral regions of the lungs, and
did not analyze cells in the upper airways or trachea. It is possible that there are significant
differences in SARS-CoV-2 entry gene expression between disease and control samples in the
more proximal regions of the lungs. Our study is also limited to the expression profiles of
patients with CLD without SARS-CoV-2 infection, as the collection of samples from patients
who are both infected with SARS-CoV-2 and have chronic lung disease are difficult to collect at
present. Nevertheless, our study highlights that dysregulation of genes related to viral replication
and innate immune response in the epithelial cells, and basal differences in the inflammatory
gene expression programs are key factors leading to an increased risk of COVID-19 severity and
poorer outcomes in patients with CLD.

Methods
The code for genomic analyses in this paper is available at https://github.com/tgen/banovichlab/
scRNA-seq samples. scRNA-seq data were obtained from published data with samples in the
“VUMC/TGen” dataset from Habermann et. al. (2020) (GEO accession GSE135893), samples in
the “Yale/BWH” dataset came from Adams et. al. (2020) (GEO accession number GSE136831),
samples in the “Pittsburg” dataset from Morse et. al. (2019) (GEO accession GSE128033) and
samples in the “Northwestern” dataset from Reyfman et al. (2019) (GEO accession GSE122960)
(Supplementary Table 1, 2). Additionally, there are 39 unpublished scRNA-seq samples in the
“VUMC/TGen” dataset that were collected under Vanderbilt IRB #’s 060165, 171657 and
Western IRB # 20181836.
scRNA-seq data processing. Seurat v3.1.5 package 74 was used to process the scRNA-seq data.
Specifically, for the Pittsburgh, Northwestern datasets and 39 unpublished samples from the
VUMC/TGen, the CellRanger (10X Genomics) output files were read into Seurat using the
function Read10X, the remaining datasets were already in Seurat format and were loaded using
the function readRDS. To eliminate low-quality/dying cells or empty droplets, we removed any
cells containing fewer than 1,000 genes or more than 25% mitochondrial genes. Due to the large
size of the joint dataset, we performed SCTransform75 for normalization and scaling of each
dataset separately, split into four major cell populations using known markers: EPCAM+
(Epithelial), PECAM1+ PTPRC - (Endothelial), PTPRC + (Immune) and EPCAM- PECAMPTPRC- (Mesenchymal). Each population from the four datasets was then merged together to
generate four merged Seurat objects (Endothelial, Epithelial, Immune and Mesenchymal). Next,
each object was SCTransformed with “dataset” being used as batch_var to eliminate batch
effects between datasets. Cell type annotation was manually performed on each object using
known cell-type specific markers (Supplementary Fig. 1, 32). For each cell population, cell type
annotation was performed at four levels, ranging from the most general to more granular
annotation. After removing doublet cells, all four population datasets were merged to generate
the final ILD object containing a total of 605,904 cells and 38 distinct cell types (Supplementary
Table 2, Supplementary Fig. 1).
Integrated analysis of joint dataset. To calculate the percentage of single positive or double
positive cells for ACE2 and other cofactors, we counted the number of cells with >0 transcripts
of corresponding genes. For double positive, cells have >0 transcripts of both genes of interest.
Tukey Honest Significant Difference (Tukey_HSD) statistical test from the R package rstatix
with a confidence level of 0.95 was used to test statistical dependence of cells expressing the
SARS-CoV-2 mediators among chronic disease subsets.

To assess the expression profile of SARS-CoV-2 mediators (ACE2, BSG, NRP1, HSPA5), the
corresponding proteases (TMPRSS2, CTSL, FURIN) and other candidate genes involved in
SARS-CoV-2 infection in different chronic lung disease subset (COPD, IPF or Other-ILD), we
ran the function FindMarkers in Seurat package using the negative binomial test. To account for
batch effects, we used the parameter “latent_vars” to incorporate the four variables (Age,
Ethnicity, Smoking status and Dataset) into the negative binomial model. For the binary
heatmap, the differential expression analysis was performed between the Disease (including all
chronic disease subset) and Control samples. Then, log2 fold-change was converted into 0
(downregulated in the disease samples) or 1 (upregulated in the disease samples) regardless of
the Bonferroni adjusted p-values. Heatmaps were generated from the adjusted log2FC values
using the heatmap.2 function of the gplots R package 76, and exact binomial statistics tests were
performed to test whether the selected genes are upregulated in the disease samples across cell
types. For the boxplots, count numbers of selected genes were plotted using the geom_boxplot
and geom_jitter function of the ggplot2 R package 77. Significant differences in gene expression
in the boxplots were the Bonferroni adjusted p-values calculated from the FindMarkers function
between Control and Disease groups (COPD, IPF, Other ILD) using the fitted negative binomial
model and latent_vars parameters as described above.
Gene module score. To calculate the combined expression of genes, we used the
AddModuleScore in Seurat v3.1.5 package. SARS-CoV-2 entry gene scores were calculated on
SARS-CoV-2 receptors and mediators: ACE2, BSG (CD147), NRP1, HSPA5(GRP78),
TMPRSS2, CTSL, FURIN and ADAM17. HLA type II score includes HLA-DRA, HLA-DQA1,
HLA-DQA2, HLA-DPA1, HLA-DRB1, HLA-DPB1, HLA-DQB2, HLA-DRB5, HLA-DQB1, HLADMA, HLA-DMB. IFN score includes ISG15, IFI44, IFI27, CXCL10, RSAD2, IFIT1, IFI44L,
CCL8, XAF1, GBP1, IRF7, CEACAM1. IL6 scores were calculated on six tocilizumab
responsive genes: ARID5A, SOCS3, PIM1, BCL3, BATF, MYC that are associated with the IL-6
pathway 56. Cytotoxicity associated genes include PRF1, GZMH, IFNG, NKG7, KLRG1, PRF1 56
and GNLY, GZMB, GZMK 78. Exhaustion gene set: LAG3, TIGIT, PDCD1, CTLA4, HAVCR2,
TOX 58 and PRDM1, MAF 56. Significant differences between different groups were calculated
using the Tukey_HSD statistic test in the R package rstatix with a confidence level of 0.95
(Supplementary Table 5).
Gene correlation analysis. To identify genes that correlate with ACE2 in the AT2 ACE2+ cells,
we performed Spearman correlation coefficient analysis on the log-transformed and normalized
data using the function cor.test in the R stats v3.6.1 package with Benjamini-Hochberg
corrections for p_adjusted values.
Immunohistochemistry of ACE2 and anti-αvβ6 integrin. Formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded
histological sections of human lung were cut at 5-microns and dewaxed in xylene prior to
rehydration in decreasing concentrations of ethanol. The tissue samples were obtained after
informed consent and local ethics approval (South East Scotland SAHSC Bioresource-reference

Samples; non-diseased controls- reference number (Q)GM030404 and Nottingham BRC
samples- reference number 08/H0407/1). IHC staining was performed using the Novocastra
Novolink™ Polymer Detection Systems kit (Code: RE7280-K, Leica, Biosystems, Newcastle,
UK) as previously described 79. Heat-induced citrate antigen retrieval (pH 6.0) and pepsin
antigen retrieval was performed for Rabbit monoclonal ACE2 (ab108252, EPR4435(2) Abcam,
UK) and the anti-αvβ6 integrin antibody (6.2A1; Biogen, Cambridge, MA, USA), respectively.
Rabbit monoclonal ACE2 (1:400) and anti-αvβ6 integrin (1:3000) was diluted in Leica antibody
diluent (RE AR9352, Leica, Biosystems, UK) and incubated with the sections overnight at 40C.
Novolink DAB substrate buffer plus was used as the chromogen and the slides were
counterstained with Novolink haematoxylin for 6 min, dehydrated and cover slipped. A negative
control without the application of the primary antibody, and was also used to ensure staining was
only related to the presence of the antibody.
The immunohistochemically stained slides were scanned using a ScanScope XT Slide Scanner
(Leica Aperio Technologies, Vista, CA, USA) under 20x objective magnification (0.5µm
resolution) using Pannoramic Viewer (3DHISTECH Ltd Budapest, Hungary) slide viewing
software. Both the percentage of staining and staining intensity of ACE2 expression in lung
sections were individually assessed. For ACE2 quantification, the following scoring system of
six high-power fields at X40. per tissue section were used:
The coding was performed prior to scoring/analysis as: 0-Negative; 1-0–10%; 2-11–25%; 326%. Statistical analyses were completed using GraphPad Prism 7.0 (GraphPad Software, San
Diego, CA, USA). One-way analysis of variance was used for comparison of more than two data
sets and significant differences between diagnosis groups were calculated using Tukey HSD test.
