Since its debut in mid-December, 2019, the novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) has rapidly spread
from its origin in Wuhan, China, to several countries across the globe, leading to a global health
crisis. As of February 7, 2020, 44 strains of the virus have been sequenced and uploaded to
NCBI’s GenBank [1], providing insight into the virus’s evolutionary history and pathogenesis.
Here, we present the WashU Virus Genome Browser, a web-based portal for viewing virus
genomic data. The browser is home to 16 complete 2019-nCoV genome sequences, together
with hundreds of related viral sequences including severe acute respiratory syndrome
coronavirus (SARS-CoV), Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV), and
Ebola virus. In addition, the browser features unique customizability, supporting user-provided
upload of novel viral sequences in various formats. Sequences can be viewed in both a trackbased representation as well as a phylogenetic tree-based view, allowing the user to easily
compare sequence features across multiple strains. The WashU Virus Genome Browser
inherited many features and track types from the WashU Epigenome Browser, and additionally
incorporated a new type of SNV track to address the specific needs of viral research. Our Virus
Browser portal can be accessed at https://virusgateway.wustl.edu, and documentation is
available at https://virusgateway.readthedocs.io/.

On December 12, 2019, the first case of a novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) was reported in
Wuhan, China, and by February 6, 2020, the virus spread to 24 additional countries, infecting
more than 27,000 individuals and resulting in 565 fatalities, according to the World Health
Organization (WHO) [2]. The 2019-nCoV is a member of the Betacoronavirus genus, which is
one of four genera of coronaviruses of the subfamily Orthocoronavirinae in the family
Coronaviridae, of the order Nidovirales [3, 4]. The species in this genus are enveloped, contain
a positive single-stranded RNA genome, and are of zoonotic, likely bat, origins [5]. 2019-nCoV
is one of the largest RNA virus genomes varying from 27kb to 32kb in size, with this particular

strain ringing in at 29,903 bps long [6]. The virus is one of 7 coronaviruses known to infect
humans, and along with the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) and
the Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV), 2019-nCoV is one of the
species responsible for severe respiratory distress in humans as well as other animals [4]. In an
effort to better understand the pathogenesis of this family of viruses, several groups have
sequenced individual strains, providing a powerful resource hosted by NCBI.
The WashU Epigenome Browser is a powerful tool for visualizing multiple functional genomic
datasets and data types simultaneously [5-8]. The general layout of the Epigenome Browser
displays the genome on the x-axis, and individual tracks encompassing many different varieties
can be loaded and viewed in the context of the genome and accompanying metadata. Recent
updates to the browser have incorporated new functionality, including live browsing, greatly
enhancing its functionality [5]. With this powerful tool in-hand, we sought to adapt the browser
for use of visualizing viral genomes, to support more efficient research and more rapid
knowledge dissemination in response to the recent 2019-nCoV outbreak. To accomplish this,
we created the WashU Virus Genome Browser, adapted from the WashU Epigenome Browser.
The Virus Genome Browser houses reference genomes for 2019-nCoV, MERS, SARS, and
Ebola virus, along with several annotation tracks including gene annotation, putative antibodybinding epitopes, CG density, and sequence diversity. Complete genomes of individual strains
of each virus species (16, 551, 332, and 1574, respectively as of February 7, 2020, and
periodically updated) are available as a database for instant viewing on the Virus Browser via
multiple track types designed to display pairwise comparison to the references. Additionally, we
aligned the genomes of all available strains in the database and generated a phylogenetic tree
for each virus species that allows the user to directly select strains from the tree and view as
tracks in the genomic display. In addition to all track types supported by the Epigenome
Browser, we designed a new SNV track type to display sequence variation. Users can upload
their own alignment results from any aligner and display them as SNV tracks on the browser.
The functionality of the Virus Browser is not limited to the 4 species currently housed. Users can
upload their own reference genome in FASTA format and display tracks in the context of the
user-specified reference. While maintaining the same functionality as that of the Epigenome
Browser and providing novel functionality to aid specifically in viral genome research, we hope
that the Virus Browser may facilitate research against new epidemic viruses.

MERS, SARS, and Ebola were downloaded (n=16, 551, 332, and 1574, respectively). The
reference genomic sequence of the selected virus (2019-nCoV: NC_045512.2; MERS:
NC_019843.3; SARS: NC_004718.3, Ebola: KM034562.1) is automatically displayed as a color
coded track when opening the genomic track browser viewing format. Genic annotations of
reference genomes were downloaded as GFF3 files from NCBI and converted to refBed format
for viewing on the browser.

The genomes of all individual strains of each virus were aligned to the reference genome using
the pairwise alignment tool stretcher [9] with parameters “-gapopen 16 -gapextend 4”. To
generate the phylogenetic trees, we used the MAFFT program, employing the fast option to
align individual strains of each viral genome to its reference [10, 11]. Phylogenetic trees were
built using FastTree with the GTR model [12, 13].

We wrote a text processing utility to import antibody-binding epitopes curated by the Immune
Epitope Database and Analysis Resource (IEDB) for MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV [15].
Subsequently, we used tblastn to align linear epitopes to the Wuhan seafood market pneumonia
virus isolate Wuhan-Hu-1 (Taxonomy ID: 2697049; NCBI:txid2697049). We found 955 out of
2,817 linear epitopes identified in SARS had at least 1 “hit” in the 2019-nCoV genome
[Supplementary Data 1]. Three epitopes have 2 “hits” each. However, the secondary hit is on
the negative strand with very low percent identity (37.5% to 53.8%) to the 2019-nCoV genome
and are hence filtered out as 2019-nCoV is a (+) ssRNA virus. Similarly, we found 1 hit out of 38
linear epitopes identified in MERS. We also provide scripts [14] that can be used to obtain a
quick overview of the similarity of linear epitopes identified in other viruses in databases like
IEDB. These tracks can provide researchers preliminary data to support exploratory analyses
pertaining to the immunogenicity of 2019-nCoV—an actively explored vertical of 2019-nCoV
research.

Sequence Diversity Track and Shannon Track:

We developed the SNV track type to display sequence variation of individual strains relative to
their reference. Variations from the reference genome, including mismatches and deletions, are
displayed with customizable colors. Insertions compared to the reference genome can be
expanded upon selecting to show the nucleotides inserted. When viewing large regions, such as
the whole genome, it is not possible to display all individual variation events. Therefore, the
frequency of variation events is also displayed in a “density mode” where a high value over a
region signifies multiple sequence variation events within the region.

GC density tracks were created for each reference genome, displaying the percentage of G
(guanine) and C (cytosine) bases in 5-bp windows.

In order to display a measure of sequence conservation across the genome, we calculated the
percentage of each of the 4 nucleotides at each position in the genome across all strains for a
given virus species. The resulting bed tracks display the percentages each nucleotide
comprises across all strain for each genomic position. We also calculated Shannon entropy for
each position along the genome using the percentages of each of the 4 nucleotides. A high
Shannon entropy at a position signifies that the 4 possible nucleotides are equally likely across
all strains of this virus, and thus the position is likely divergent. A low Shannon entropy at a
position means that the identity of the nucleotide at this position is highly conserved across all
strains. The entropy() function of the R package “entropy” was used for calculations.

Resources for User-Defined Bed and Categorical Tracks:
In addition to our housed data tracks, we also offer scripts (“publicParseAlignment.py”,
“publicAlignment.py”, and “publicConvertMarkx3.py”) to convert any markx3 or FASTAformatted alignment into displayable bed and categorical formats, and a script
(“publicJsonGen.py”) to generate a json file for uploading multiple data files together for display
[https://github.com/debugpoint136/WashU-Virus-Genome-Browser]. A default color code for
sequence variation is also included in the script.

The WashU Virus Genome Browser houses consensus reference genomic sequences for 4
different pathogenic virus species: 2019-nCoV, MERS, SARS, and Ebola, as well as a
comprehensive set of genome assemblies for the individual strains of each virus (16, 551, 332,
and 1574, respectively). When users first navigate to the WashU Virus Browser and select
“Browse Data”, they are directed to a page with several customizable options, including a dropdown menu from which they may choose a reference genome [Figure 1]. Corresponding with
the reference genome selected, a metadata table is displayed containing sortable features such
as species, strain, isolate, isolation source, host, country, and collection date, to allow for quick
and easy sorting of individual strains. The user may select viral isolates from the metadata table
to be visualized in one of our two displayable platforms: the track view (green arrow, Figures 2
and 3) or the phylogenetic tree view (orange arrow, Figures 4 and 5).

The track view option has a standard genome browser layout similar to that of the WashU
Epigenome Browser, in which a reference genome sequence is visualized as a sliding window.
Various annotation data tracks are hosted on the browser and can be loaded for visualization in
a genomic context. For each virus, we downloaded publicly available annotations of the
reference genome and converted these annotations into refBed tracks that can be visualized in
the genome browser. Likewise, immune epitopes identified in SARS were aligned to the 2019nCoV reference [Materials and Methods], and a track displaying their coordinates in 2019-nCoV
is provided. GC-density tracks were also created for each reference genome, and display the
percentage of Gs (Guanines) and Cs (Cytosines) per 5bp window. An entropy track [Materials
and Methods] showing the degree of sequence diversity at each position and a diversity track
[Materials and Methods] showing the percentage of each of the 4 nucleotides at each position
across all strains of the given virus species are also included in the database. In addition to

hosting 4 virus species reference genomes, The Virus Genome Browser also supports
displaying user-specified genomes provided in FASTA format, as shown in the top left part of
Figure 2A, under the browser logo.
The WashU Virus Browser supports a “zoomed-out” view of the entire viral genome. The
zoomed-out view can help the user quickly determine the regions of interest that have high
frequencies of variation from the reference (SNV track), and also the regions with high
nucleotide diversity among all strains (Shannon tracks) [Figure 2A]. Figure 2A illustrates a
genome-level browser view of the 2019-nCoV reference genome and 2 SARS strains, each
aligned to the SARS reference genome (AY278488.2 = BJ01, DQ071615.1 = Bat rp3,
NC_045512.2 = 2019-nCoV). Sequence variation displayed in density mode [Materials and
Methods] shows that the divergence between the 2019-nCoV reference genome (red) and the
SARS reference genome is higher than the divergence between the two additional SARS
strains (green) and the SARS reference genome. For AY278488.2, the variation from reference
is mainly confined to the beginning of the genome, while the remainder of the genome is
relatively consistent with the reference. However, for DQ071615.1 (bat-derived), the 5’ end of
gene S displays high variation from the reference genome. Likewise, the SARS Shannon track
shows that the SARS genome is highly diverse across different strains at gene S.
Once a region of interest is identified, the standard magnification tool of the browser can be
used to quickly zoom into the region [Figure 2A]. Upon zooming in, a genome comparison track
can be used to inspect variations from the reference genome, particularly useful for comparing
cross-species alignments and viewing structural variations [Figure 2B]. The genome comparison
track is adopted from the Epigenome Browser. The top navy-colored horizontal bar represents
the reference genome loaded (SARS in the case of Figure 2B) and the bottom purple-colored
horizontal bar represents the sequence being aligned to the reference (the 2019-nCoV
reference sequence, NC_045512.2, in this case). Insertions and deletions are represented as
gaps in either the reference or the query. Matches are represented by black lines linking the 2
genomes while mismatches are distinguished by omission of the black bar. When the user
hovers over a specific nucleotide, the alignment details around that specific nucleotide are
shown.
Upon further magnification, regions can be inspected on a nucleotide level. Mismatches,
insertions, and deletions are color-coded in the SNV tracks and stretches of grey signify
positions matching the reference [Figure 2C]. Detailed information, such as inserted
nucleotides, is displayed upon clicking. When zoomed into individual nucleotides, as shown in
Figure 2C, The diversity bed track shows the percentage of each nucleotide across all strains of
SARS at the specific position.
The versatility of the WashU browser framework makes it possible to adapt the browser to
address various questions of interest. Figure 3 demonstrates the utility of using the browser for
immune epitope conservation discovery. We recapitulated Zhou et al.’s [16] alignment results of
two SARS strains to the reference 2019-nCoV nucleocapsid protein sequence [Figure 3A, 3B].
Upon inspection of the region, we could directly observe that many immune epitopes are
conserved between SARS and 2019-nCoV [Figure 3C]. The user can identify the amino acid
sequence of an epitope by simply clicking the track.
Encouraged by the high sequence similarity between SARS-CoV and the 2019-nCoV reference
strain (NCBI:txid2697049), we mined the list of experimentally identified linear epitopes from Tcell, B-cell and MHC-ligand assays from IEDB [15]. We identified a list of 320 high-confidence

linear epitopes [Supplementary Table 2] whose amino acids are identical to predicted translated
products from the 2019-nCoV reference strain. These provide a catalogue of epitopes for
researchers testing immune targets that can potentially elicit T-cell, B-cell and antibody
response to 2019-nCoV.

The second viewing option offered by the WashU Virus Genome Browser is a “tree” format, in
which the evolutionary relationships of different viral isolates can be visualized as a
phylogenetic tree [17]. When the user navigates to the data page of the browser, and selects
“Tree View” [Figure 1], all viral genomes hosted on the browser for the selected virus species
are displayed in the form of a right-aligned phylogenetic tree, where solid lines indicate branch
lengths [Figure 4]. To the right of the tree is a metadata heatmap displaying strain-specific
details such as isolate, isolation source, host, country, and collection date. Additionally, if the
user added any individual tracks to their cart from the main page, those selected will display a
checkmark to the right, allowing the user to easily see where their strains of interest lie among
all other strains.

We also provide these as an annotated bed track to the reference 2019-nCoV genome. Along
with the individual strains’ SNV tracks, the epitope tracks can provide a quick, intuitive and
visual resource to guide prioritization of experimental resources towards developing diagnostics
and therapeutics against 2019-nCoV. The value of our novel SNV tracks will only increase as
additional strains are sequenced, helping us better understand the evolving 2019-nCoV genome
and prioritize epitopes.

In addition to the right-aligned tree view, the browser also supports a more traditional leftaligned linear tree view and a radial view. The left-aligned tree view displays branch lengths
indicating relatedness of isolates [Figure 5A]. We noticed that in each virus type, several
individual strains maintained high sequence similarity, resulting in several short branch lengths
and a long vertical tree. In order to improve visualization, we also created a radial tree view
[Figure 5B].

Maps help us understand the world around us and navigate it. Moreover, they play a critical role
in disaster management during disease outbreaks. Herein, we describe the first genetic
mapping, exploration, and visualization tool from the WashU Epigenome Browser team that is
specifically dedicated to viral genomes. We provide reference genome maps and genomic
datasets related to 4 viral disease outbreaks: SARS (2002-03), MERS (2012), Ebola (2014-16)
and the latest nCoV (2019-20). More importantly, we not only present publicly available
information in the format of easily accessible data tracks, but also offer a platform with high
customizability and flexibility where individual investigators and teams can upload and visualize
their own genomic datasets in a plethora of formats. In this report, we have demonstrated using
the Virus Browser to 1) quickly and intuitively compare multiple viral genomes and study the
viral genome at multiple levels [Figure 2, Figure 4, Figure 5]; and 2) combine viral genome
information with other functional genomic information (amino acid sequence and putative

supports, and identify potential therapeutic targets.
We expect that the WashU Virus Browser can support research related to the latest novel
Coronavirus outbreak of 2019-20, and hope that this tool helps accelerate research to further
our understanding of 2019-nCoV and aid in the development of therapeutics. In addition, our
platform supports the study of any user-specified viral genome, and can be expanded to other
viral research.
To aid in the battle against this crisis, we are releasing the browser at first moment. The browser
is still under active construction and is constantly being updated. General feedback, suggestions
for additional tracks, and bug reports may be sent to the WashU Virus Genome Browser team
by opening an issue request at https://github.com/debugpoint136/WashU-Virus-GenomeBrowser/issues.

Figure Captions
Figure 1: Screenshot of the WashU Virus Genome Browser data page. This view demonstrates
several customizable features of the browser, including which genome reference to use, which
data tracks to select based on several metadata features, and which browser view to use:
“genomic” view (green arrow) or phylogenetic tree view (orange arrow).
Figure 2: Illustration of genomic-level and nucleotide-level track views. A: “zoomed out” track
view of the entire genome. 2019-nCoV reference genome (shown in red, NC045512.2) and 2
SARS strains (shown in green, DQ071615.1 and AY278488.2) are aligned to the SARS
reference genome (NC_004718.3). The box in the top left corner allows users to upload and use
any sequence in FASTA format as the reference genome. The shaded vertical bar
demonstrates the user’s ability to select a region by mouse for further magnification. B:
“Zoomed in” view of the sequence flanking the 5’ end of the S protein. C: A further “zoomed in”
view to the level of individual nucleotides. Stretches of grey indicate matching while variations
are color coded.
Figure 3: Alignment of the genomic region encoding the nucleocapsid protein. A: 2 SARS
strains (DQ071615.1 and AY278488.2) and 5 2019-nCoV strains (MN938384.1, MN975262.1,
MN985325.1, MN988668.1, and MN988669.1) are aligned to the 2019-nCoV reference. The
region encoding the nucleocapsid protein is shown. Putative SARS immune epitopes [Materials
and Methods] are displayed in “density mode”.
B: A zoomed-in view of A (orange box), displaying the first 9 amino acids of the reference.
Results show a “TCA” insertion in the AY278488.2 alignment between positions 28294 and
28295 of the 2019-nCoV reference sequence, which is not present in DQ071615.1. These
results are consistent with the results reported in Extended Data Figure 5 of Zhou et al. [16]. C:
A zoomed-in view of A (purple box), displaying a region conserved between SARS and 2019nCoV, overlapping several putative immune epitopes.
Figure 4: Screenshot of a linear, right-aligned tree view displaying all housed 2019-nCoV
sequences with accompanying metadata. Solid lines signify distance.
Figure 5: A: Screenshot of a linear, left-aligned phylogenetic tree view, displaying all 2019nCoV strains hosted by the browser. B: Screenshot of a radial tree view for all 2019-nCoV
strains.
