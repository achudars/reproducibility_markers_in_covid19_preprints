Abstract.

28

Lower respiratory tract infections are a leading cause of mortality driven by infectious

29

agents. RNA viruses such as influenza virus, respiratory syncytial virus and the new pandemic

30

coronavirus SARS-CoV-2 can be highly pathogenic. Clinical and experimental evidence indicate

31

that most severe and lethal cases do not depend on the viral burden and are, instead,

32

characterized by an aberrant immune response. In this work we assessed how the innate immune

33

response contributes to the pathogenesis of RNA virus infections. We demonstrate that type III

34

interferons produced by dendritic cells in the lung in response to viral recognition cause barrier

35

damage and compromise the host tissue tolerance. In particular, type III interferons inhibit tissue

36

repair and lung epithelial cell proliferation, causing susceptibility to lethal bacterial superinfections.

37

Overall, our data give a strong mandate to rethink the pathophysiological roles of this group of

38

interferons and their possible use in the clinical practice against endemic as well as emerging

39

viral infections.

Main text.

43

The ability to resolve viral infections of the lung is dependent on the actions of interferons (IFNs)

44

and inflammatory cytokines. These molecules are induced during viral infections, yet the relative

45

contributions of each interferon or cytokine to host defense and a return to homeostasis remains

46

undefined. In particular the actions of type III IFNs (IFN-λ) have attracted much attention, as

47

these cytokines operate primarily at mucosal surfaces, in part due to the selective expression of

48

the type III IFN receptor in epithelia and neutrophils (1–3). Recent work established that unlike

49

their type I or II counterparts, type III IFN signaling induces antiviral activities while simultaneously

50

minimizing the tissue destructive activity of neutrophils (4–6). When considered in the context of

51

an increasing number of viral infections, including the recently emerged severe acute respiratory

52

syndrome (SARS)-coronavirus (CoV)-2, where inflammation appears to be the primary driver of

53

life threatening symptoms (7–12) , the ability of type III IFNs to limit immunopathology but maintain

54

antiviral activity is significant. Indeed, discussions on the possible use of IFN-λ against SARS-

55

COV-2 have begun (13) and a clinical trial (14) has been initiated with the human pegylated-IFN-

56

λ1a. Despite this interest of the use of type III IFNs to treat viral infections, we know very little

57

about the short- and long-term actions of this family of secreted factors.

58

During viral infections of the lung, immunopathology may predispose the host to opportunistic

59

bacterial infections, referred to as superinfections, which take advantage of this unbalanced status

60

and often lead to lethal consequences (15–17). In contrast to its protective effect against acute

61

viral infections, IFN-λ was found to decrease bacterial control in virus-bacteria superinfection

62

models(18–20) . Whether this is due to the anti-inflammatory activity of IFN-λ that results in a

63

reduced resistance of the host to a subsequent bacterial infection or to the capacity of this group

64

of interferons to alter the physiology of the lung upon a viral encounter remains unresolved. As

65

of present the contribution of type III IFN to the human pathology of severe viral infections and

66

bacterial superinfections is unknown. Superinfections represent the first cause of lethality upon

67

influenza virus infection (21) and correlate with severity in coronavirus disease (COVID)-19

68

patients (11, 22–24). Mouse models of SARS, middle east respiratory syndrome (MERS) (25, 26)

69

and influenza (5, 27–29) are characterized by a robust induction of IFN-λ, however, the

70

involvement of this group of interferons in COVID-19 is more controversial. Although in vitro

71

studies on nasal and bronchial primary epithelial cells demonstrate IFN-λ induction by SARS-

72

CoV-2 (30), another study found a reduced production of both type I and type III IFNs in vitro and

73

ex vivo (31).

74

To directly evaluate the capacity of SARS-CoV-2 to induce interferons in the upper or

75

lower airways, we tested the presence of IFNs, and other inflammatory cytokines, in the swabs

76

of COVID-19 patients and healthy controls, as well as the bronchoalveolar (BAL) fluid of severe

77

SARS-CoV-2-positive patients. Although we confirmed that COVID-19 patients present a scarce

78

production of inflammatory mediators in the upper airways, the BAL fluid of patients with severe

79

disease presented elevated levels not only of inflammatory cytokines, but also of specific

80

members of the type III IFN family (Fig. 1A-E). Thus, IFN-λ production is associated with the most

81

pathogenic endemic as well as emerging RNA viral infections.

82

In order to directly evaluate the contribution of IFN-λ to the immune pathology driven by

83

RNA respiratory viruses uncoupled from its effect on viral replication, we devised an experimental

84

system in which pattern recognition receptors (PRR) involved in viral sensing were stimulated

85

with their cognate ligands in mice that can, or cannot, respond to IFN-λ. RNA viruses are directly

86

sensed by two major classes of PRR (32, 33) . Toll-like receptors (TLR) recognize viral nucleic

87

acids in the endosomal compartment with TLR7 recognizing single-stranded RNA directly from

88

virions in the endosomes (34) and TLR3 recognizing double-stranded RNA intermediate derived

89

from dying infected cells (35). The cytosolic sensors retinoic acid-inducible gene I (RIG-I) and

90

melanoma differentiation-associated protein 5 (MDA5) instead, recognize double strand and

91

hairpin RNA from replicating viruses (32, 33) in association with the common adaptor

92

mitochondrial antiviral signaling protein (MAVS). We thus intra-tracheally instilled the TLR7 ligand

93

R848 and the synthetic analog of double-stranded RNA, polyinosine-polycytidylic acid (poly (I:C))

94

that stimulates both TLR3 and the RIG-I/MDA5-MAVS pathway in vivo (36, 37). Viral-sensing

95

PPRs were stimulated over the course of six days to simulate prolonged innate immune activation

96

in the lung. Only poly (I:C) treatment induced morbidity as measured by body weight and

97

temperature drop (Fig. 1F and Fig. S1A), and only poly (I:C) treatment compromised barrier

98

function as measured by the level of total protein and lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) in the

99

bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) (Fig. 1G and Fig. S1B). Increase in morbidity and decrease in

100

barrier function correlated with the levels of IFN-I and IFN-λ, whose mRNAs are strongly

101

upregulated in the lung of mice treated with poly (I:C) but not in mice treated with R848 (Fig. 1H,

102

I). In contrast R848 treatment induced upregulation of pro inflammatory cytokines (i.e. IL-1β) but

103

had no correlation with barrier function or temperature decrease (Fig. 1F-J).

104

Alterations in the epithelial barrier are known to predispose to lethal bacterial

105

superinfections (38–40), we therefore infected mice treated with either R848 or poly (I:C) with

106

Staphylococcus aureus (S. aureus). Only poly (I:C) treatment was sufficient to induce lethality

107

upon S. aureus infection (Fig. 1K). Moreover poly (I:C) treated mice displayed a higher bacterial

108

burden (Fig. 1L), a stronger hypothermia upon S. aureus infection, and higher barrier damage

109

(Fig. S2A, B). S. aureus infection did not alter the pattern of IFN production as only poly (I:C)

110

induces upregulation of interferons’ mRNAs (Fig. S2C-E). While both IFN-I and IFN-λ transcripts

111

are upregulated over time upon poly (I:C) treatment (Fig. S3A, B), IFN-I protein levels measured

112

in whole lung lysates are low and plateau after 1d of treatment while IFN-λ protein levels increase

113

over time (Fig. S3C, D) and their increase correlates with S. aureus bacterial burden (Fig. S3E).

114

Moreover, transcript levels of CXCL10, which is induced by IFN-I and not by IFN-λ (5, 41) peak

115

at day 1 and reach a plateau over the following days (Fig. S3F), consistent with IFN-I protein

116

expression kinetics. Conversely, the expression of the interferon-stimulated gene (ISG) Rsad2,

117

which is induced similarly by both IFN classes, increases over time and, thus, correlates with

118

increasing IFN-λ production (Fig. S3G). As expected, pro-inflammatory cytokines are expressed

119

at low levels throughout the kinetic study (Fig. S3H, I). The correlation of bacterial burden with

120

IFN-λ protein kinetics suggests a causal relationship between IFN-λ production and susceptibility

121

to superinfection. Indeed, administration of exogenous IFN-λ concomitantly with R848, which

122

induces immune activation but not interferon production, was sufficient to induce sensitivity to S.

123

aureus infection, increasing morbidity and bacterial burden (Fig. 1M, N). Overall, these data

124

indicate that IFN-λ is sufficient to break the lung tolerance and induce susceptibility to subsequent

125

bacterial infections.

126

Next, we examined if IFN-λ is not only sufficient but also necessary to establish morbidity

127

and sensitize to bacterial superinfection upon viral exposure. Contrary to wild-type (WT) mice,

128

mice deficient in interferon lambda receptor 1 expression (Ifrnlr1-/- mice) are completely protected

129

from poly (I:C) induced morbidity, both in terms of hypothermia induction and weight loss (Fig.

130

2A, and Fig. S4A), and do not develop barrier damage (Fig. 2B, and Fig. S4B). Consistently with

131

the absence of barrier defects, Ifnrl1-/- mice are completely protected from lethality upon S. aureus

132

superinfection (Fig. 2C) and show lower bacterial burden (Fig. 2D), lower barrier damage and

133

decreased hypothermic response (Fig. 2E, F) compared to WT mice. Deletion of IFNLR1 doesn’t

134

impact levels of mRNA or protein of IFNs or pro-inflammatory cytokines (Fig. S4C-H), confirming

135

the direct role of IFN-λ in this context. Collectively these observations show that sustained

136

expression of IFN-λ after RNA virus recognition is both necessary and sufficient to induce barrier

137

breach and sensitization to S. aureus infection.

138

Our data demonstrate that IFN-λ alters the lung epithelial barrier function, but we and

139

others also showed that this group of interferons downmodulates host immune resistance, by

140

inhibiting ROS release, migration , and pro-inflammatory cytokine release by neutrophils(4–6), a

141

key immune cell population involved in the response against lung viral infections(42, 43). Both

142

decrease in barrier integrity(39, 40, 44), and decreased microbicidal activity of myeloid cells (45–

143

47) are known to influence superinfection sensitivity. Therefore, we analyzed the relative

144

contribution of IFN-λ to directly modulate immune functions and epithelial cell biology to the

145

establishment of morbidity and S. aureus superinfection sensitivity in response to poly (I:C)

stimulation. To this end we generated reciprocal bone marrow chimeras in which either the

147

hematopoietic compartment (Ifnlr1-/-à WT) or the stromal compartment (WTà Ifnlr1-/-) were

148

defective for IFN-λ signaling, and the appropriate controls (Ifnlr1-/-à Ifnlr1-/-, WTà WT). WTà

149

Ifnlr1-/- mice phenocopied complete Ifnlr1-/-à Ifnlr1-/- chimeras, displaying lower barrier damage

150

before and after S. aureus infection (Fig. 2G, and Fig. S5), and decreased bacterial burden (Fig.

151

2H). In contrast, Ifnlr1-/-à WT behaved like WTà WT mice (Fig. 2G, H). While IFN-λ may

152

modulate immune function indirectly (71), we did not observe differences in myeloid immune cell

153

recruitment in Ifnlr1-/- mice compared to WT (fig. S6A-D). Moreover, depletion of neutrophils did

154

not impact bacterial burden under our experimental conditions (Fig. S6E), further supporting a

155

direct role of IFN-λ on the epithelial barrier. Overall, these data demonstrate that IFN-λ signaling

156

in epithelial cells is necessary and sufficient to impair lung tolerance, inducing barrier damage

157

and susceptibility to a secondary infection.

158

In order to determine the molecular mechanisms elicited by IFN-λ in epithelial cells, we

159

performed a targeted transcriptomic analysis on sorted epithelial cells from either WT or Ifnlr1-/-

160

mice after poly (I:C) treatment (Fig. 3A, S7). Pathway analysis of

161

differentially expressed genes (DEGs), revealed a potent downregulation of the IFN signature in

162

Ifnlr1-/- compared to WT epithelial cells (Fig. 3B), confirming the predominant role of this group of

163

IFNs compared to IFN-I during prolonged viral stimulation in the lung. Consistent with the

164

observed defect in barrier function, genes associated with apoptosis and the activation of the p53

165

pathway (Fig. 3B) were enriched in WT epithelial cells compared to Ifnlr1-/- (Fig. 3B), while

166

pathways involved in positive regulation of the cell cycle were enriched in Ifnlr1-/- cells (Fig. 3C).

167

Accordingly, epithelial cells in Ifnlr1-/- mice proliferate more efficiently after poly (I:C) administration

168

(Fig. 3D) (as well as after S.aureus superinfection (Fig. 3E)) as measured by 5-Ethynyl-2´-

169

deoxyuridine (EdU) incorporation, or expression of the proliferation marker Ki67 (Fig. 3F). In

170

agreement with these data, epithelial cells in WTà Ifnlr1-/- chimeras also proliferate more

171

efficiently than mice that bear WT stromal cells, and phenocopy Ifnlr1-/- à Ifnlr1-/- chimeras (Fig.

172

3G). These data further support the direct activity of IFN-λ on epithelial cells.

173

Interestingly, the gene that was most downregulated in Ifnlr1-/- epithelial cells compared to

174

WT cells is the E3 ubiquitin-protein ligase makorin-1 (Mrkn1) (Fig. 3A),

175

which controls p53 and p21 stability by favoring their proteasomal degradation (48). Under

176

oxidative stress condition and DNA damage, a hallmark of severe viral infections (49), p53 is

177

stabilized by phosphorylation and p21 degradation, mediated by Mkrn1, favors apoptosis over

178

DNA repair (48). Indeed, Ifnlr1-/- epithelial cells, that express lower levels of Mkrn1, have elevated

179

levels of p21 as measured by flow cytometry (Fig. 3H, I). These data indicate that the capacity of

180

IFN-λ to reduce tissue tolerance stems from its capacity to inhibit tissue repair by directly

181

influencing epithelial cell proliferation and viability. Also, that p21 degradation via Mrkn1

182

upregulation is potently influenced by IFN-λ signaling.

183

RNA viruses can use several strategies to modulate the immune response to their

184

advantage(33, 50), therefore it is crucial to understand the molecular pathways involved in the

185

maintenance of sustained IFN-λ production. Moreover, the difference between mRNA expression

186

and protein levels of interferons suggest that a low abundance cell type with high secretory

187

capacity may be responsible for long term IFN-λ production. We thus investigated the cellular

188

source and molecular pathways that drive IFN-λ production in our model. Early after initial

189

influenza virus infection, IFN-λ is expressed by infected epithelial cells, however, at later time

190

points, DCs from the parenchyma of the lung start to express high levels of the IFN-λ transcript(5).

191

We thus hypothesized that lung DCs are the main producers of IFN-λ and are responsible for the

192

secretion of IFN-λ during viral infections. Accordingly, sorted lung resident dendritic cells express

193

high levels of IFN-λ transcript after 5 days of poly (I:C) treatment, in contrast to epithelial cells,

194

alveolar macrophages and monocytes (Fig. 4A), which, instead, express IFN-I and pro-

195

inflammatory cytokines (Fig. S8A, B). Moreover, diphtheria toxin (DT)-mediated depletion of

196

CD11c+ cells in CD11c-DT receptor (DTR) mice was sufficient to completely abolish IFN-λ

197

transcript and protein upregulation upon 6 days of poly (I:C) treatment (Fig. 4B, C), while IFN-I

198

production remained unaltered (Fig. S8C, D). Having established that DCs are the main cell type

199

involved in IFN-λ production, we analyzed the relevance of the three main RNA virus recognition

200

pathways in the induction of IFN-λ in dendritic cells (i.e. TLR7-MyD88, RIG-I/MDA5-MAVS, TLR3-

201

TRIF). We thus generated DCs from FMS-like tyrosine kinase 3 ligand (FLT3L)-derived bone

202

marrow cell cultures (FLT3L-DCs). In vitro derived FLT3L-DCs comprise plasmacytoid DCs

203

(pDCs), cDC1 and cDC2 like cells (53) and are well suited to model tissue DC responses in vitro.

204

IFN-λ was induced only when the TLR3-TRIF pathway was activated by administering poly (I:C)

205

in the supernatant, while neither stimulation of the RIG-I/MDA5-MAVS pathway by intracellular

206

delivery of poly (I:C), nor stimulation of TLR7 were able to induce IFN-λ (Fig. 4D). Consistently

207

with the response measured in vivo, TLR7 stimulation did not induce IFN production while it

208

induced upregulation of pro-inflammatory cytokines, and intracellular delivery of poly (I:C) induced

209

high levels of IFN-I but not IFN-λ (Fig.4D, Fig. S9A, B). In agreement with the key role of TLR3,

210

IFN-λ production upon extracellular poly (I:C) encounter was abolished by genetic deletion of the

211

signaling adaptor TRIF (encoded by the gene Ticam1) but not by deletion of the RIG-I/MDA5

212

adaptor MAVS (Mavs) (Fig. 4D). Conversely, IFN-I production in response to intracellular delivery

213

of poly (I:C) was largely dependent on the signaling adaptor MAVS (Fig. S9A). Consistent with

214

our previous data, when the RIG-I/MAVS pathway was activated by transfection of the influenza

215

A virus derived pathogen-associated molecular pattern (PAMP) 3-phosphate-hairpin-RNA (3p-

216

hpRNA), IFN-I but not IFN-λ, was efficiently induced in a MAVS-dependent manner (Fig. S10A-

217

E, poly (I:C) was used as a control). Finally, inhibition of endosomal acidification by treatment with

218

the pharmacological agent chloroquine abolished IFN-λ induction in response to extracellular poly

219

(I:C), while it preserved IFN-I production upon intracellular poly (I:C) delivery (Fig. S11A, B).

220

These evidences clearly indicate that TLR3 stimulation potently induces IFN-λ production by DCs

221

in vitro. We, thus, explored the importance of the TLR3-TRIF pathway in vivo under our

222

experimental conditions. Dendritic cells sorted from Ticam1-/- mice treated with poly (I:C) for six

223

days did not express appreciable levels of IFN-λ transcripts while still produced type I interferons

224

(Fig. 4E, F). Moreover, poly (I:C) treated Ticam1-/- mice were protected from S. aureus

225

superinfections (Fig. 4G), and the decrease in bacterial burden correlated with lower IFN-λ

226

transcript levels in the lung, although IFN-I levels remained similar to those of WT mice (Fig. 4H,

227

I). Confirming the crucial role of TLR3 signaling in DCs for IFN-λ production, chimeric mice in

228

which Ticam1-/- bone marrow (BM) cells are transferred in a WT irradiated host (Ticam1-/àWT)

229

phenocopied Ticam1-/- animals (Fig. 4J-L).

230

The immune system evolved to prevent and resist to pathogen invasion but doing so often

231

threatens host fitness and causes disease in the form of immunopathology (51). RNA viruses are

232

the major cause of most severe lower respiratory tract viral infections (52, 53). While most virus

233

infections manifest as self-limiting upper respiratory tract infections, influenza viruses, SARS-

234

CoV, SARS-CoV-2 and MERS-CoV can progress to severe lung disease with potentially lethal

235

outcomes(50, 54, 55). Although different viruses vary in their virulence and pathogenic potential,

236

the most severe cases of lung RNA viral infections share similar features that suggest an immune

237

pathological etiology. In COVID-19, SARS, MERS and flu, severe symptoms and death occur late

238

after the initial symptoms onset, and after the peak in viral load (56–61) further indicating a central

239

role for an immune etiology of the most severe forms.

240

While IFN-λ is uniquely equipped to induce a gentler immune response that favors viral

241

clearance in the lungs without inducing overt immune activation (1, 3, 62), its impact on epithelial

242

cell biology and its effect on the maintenance of tissue integrity and tolerance to pathogen invasion

243

is incompletely understood. In a system that allowed us to isolate the effect of immune activation

244

from resistance to viral infection, we demonstrate that sustained IFN-λ production in the lung in

245

response to viral PAMPs compromises epithelial barrier function, induces lung pathology and

246

morbidity and predisposes to lethal secondary infections by impairing the capacity of the lungs to

247

tolerate bacterial invasion. Loss of lung barrier tolerance is sufficient to induce lethality upon

248

bacterial challenge independently of bacterial growth (39), and alteration of the repair response

249

in the lung can favor bacterial invasion independently from immune cell control (63). In our model

250

immune cell recruitment is not affected by IFN-λ and neutrophils are dispensable for the impaired

251

control of bacterial infections, while IFN-λ signaling on epithelial cells is necessary and sufficient

252

to cause heightened bacterial invasion.

253

Under our experimental conditions, TLR3-TRIF signaling in conventional lung DCs is

254

responsible for the induction of IFN-λ. This is consistent with reports indicating that Tlr3-deficient

255

mice are protected from influenza-induced immune pathology(64). Moreover, TLR3 detects

256

replication intermediates from necrotic cells (35) and is, thus, insensitive to viral immune evasion.

257

This is of particular interest during highly pathogenic human coronavirus infections, whose

258

success in establishing the initial infection is partly due to their ability to dampen TLR7 and MAVS

259

dependent early IFN responses(50), as indicated by their poor ability to induce IFN responses in

260

vitro in epithelial cells (31). Indeed, severe clinical manifestations and surge of IFN and cytokine

261

production are evident after the initial infection has peaked, as demonstrated by the analysis of

262

the BAL of ICU-hospitalized COVID-19 patients.

263

IFN-λ has recently been proposed as a therapeutic agent for COVID-19 infections (13),

264

and clinical trials have been initiated for mild and early SARS-CoV-2 infections (14) by virtue of

265

its unique antiviral and immune modulatory activity. However, our discovery reveals not only that

266

the most severe COVID-19 patients present high levels of type III IFNs in the lower airways, but

267

also a previously unappreciated capacity of IFN-λ to interfere with repair processes, which renders

268

treatment of severe COVID-19 patients with IFN-λ extremely dangerous. By contrast, existing

269

clinical trials are exploring inhibition of the type II cytokine signaling adaptors Janus Kinases

270

(JAKs) in severe COVID-19 patients (65). In light of our discoveries, inhibition of JAK kinases

271

could be successful by both inhibiting detrimental activities of proinflammatory cytokines such as

272

IL-6 and IFN-I, and mitigating the antiproliferative effect of IFN-λ. Intriguingly, in vitro treatment of

273

dendritic cells with chloroquine, a controversial therapeutic proposed against COVID-19(66–68),

274

completely blocks TLR3-dependent IFN-λ production. Whether this inhibitory effect translates in

275

therapeutic settings, and whether it could have beneficial outcomes in COVID-19, remains an

276

open question.

277

Collectively we demonstrate that sustained activation of antiviral immunity in the lungs

278

induces the production over time of high levels of IFN-λ by DCs through the TLR3-TRIF pathway.

279

Prolonged IFN-λ stimulation interferes with tissue repair by inhibiting epithelial cell proliferation

280

and favoring p53 mediated apoptosis. This inhibitory effect toward barrier repair induced by IFN-

281

λ can drive immunopathogenesis in severe viral infections and predispose the host to impaired

282

tolerance against opportunistic bacterial infections.

Dextran (MW:10,000da) (FD10S), Deoxyribonuclease (DNase) I from bovine pancreas
(DN25) and Dispase II (D4693) were purchased from MilliporeSigma.

In vivo treatments and infection
Intratracheal instillations (i.t.) were performed as previously described in (69) 0.5mg/kg of poly
(I:C) HMW, R848 or saline were administered i.t. daily for 6 days or as indicated in the figure
legends. Where indicated, mice were treated i.t. with recombinant 50μg/kg PEG-IFN-λ
concomitantly from day 2 post-treatment, with R848 stimulation. Staphylococcus aureus subsp.
aureus Rosenbach (ATCC® 25904™) was grown at 37°C in Tryptic Soy Broth (TSB) for 16h to
the autolytic phase, then subcultured and grown to an optical density (OD600) of 0.4, centrifuged
and resuspended in PBS immediately prior to infection. Each mouse was infected by i.t. instillation
of 0.5 x 108 CFU of S. aureus and sacrificed 12 hours post-infection, except for in survival studies.
Rectal temperature and body weights were monitored daily.

Survival study and endpoints
Mice were deemed to have reached endpoint at 75% of starting weight or after reaching body
temperature of 25°C or lower.

Generation of bone-marrow chimeras
To generate mice with hematopoietic-specific deletion of Ifnlr1 or Ticam1, 6-week-old CD45.1+
mice were exposed to lethal whole-body irradiation (950 rads per mouse) and were reconstituted

weeks. A similar procedure was used to generate bone-marrow chimeras with stromal cellsspecific deletion in Ifnlr1. Here, recipient WT or Ifnlr1-/- mice underwent irradiation and were
reconstituted with BM cells derived from CD45.1+ mice similarly as described above.
To evaluate the percentage of chimerism, a sample of peripheral blood was taken from chimeric
mice after 4 weeks of reconstitution and stained for CD45.1 and CD45.2 (antibodies as identified
under ‘Reagents and antibodies’) and were analyzed by flow cytometry.

Depletion of Dendritic cells and Neutrophils
In order to deplete CD11c+ cells, CD11c-DTR mice received 16μg/kg diphtheria toxin (DTx)
intravenously starting one day before TLR ligand or saline administration and continuing every
other day until day 6 post-treatment to maintain depletion.
In vivo depletion of neutrophils was carried out by injecting anti-Ly6G antibody (100μg/mouse)
intraperitoneally, starting one day before treatments and then continuing every other day through
the duration of the treatment. As controls for no depletion, mice were injected with rat IgG isotype
control.

Barrier permeability assessment
To assess lung permeability, treated mice were administered FITC-dextran (10μg/mouse) i.t.
before or after S. aureus infection. After 1hr of dextran instillation, blood was collected from the
retro-orbital sinus, and the plasma was separated by centrifugation. Leakage of dextran in the
bloodstream was measured as FITC fluorescence in the plasma compared to plasma from mocktreated mice.

Bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) and lung collection.
BAL was collected as described in (70) Briefly, the lungs of euthanized mice were lavaged through
the trachea with 3ml PBS to collect the BAL. Samples were centrifuged and the supernatants

were used for total protein measurement (Pierce BCA Protein Assay, Thermo Fisher Scientific
#23227) and LDH quantification (Pierce LDH Cytotoxicity Assay, Thermo Fisher Scientific
#C20301). Lungs were excised and used for RNA extraction using TRI Reagent (Zymo Research
#R2050-1-200).

Bacterial load and lung cytokine production measurement
The left lobe of the lung was weighed and homogenized in 1ml of sterile D.I. water in a
Fisherbrand™ Bead Mill 24 Homogenizer. To calculate bacterial load, homogenate was serially
diluted and plated on TSB-Agar plates in duplicate. Colonies were counted after 16h incubation,
and bacterial burden in the lungs was calculated as CFU normalized to individual lung weight.
Cytokines production in the lungs was measured in the supernatants collected after centrifuging
the lung homogenates.

Flow cytometry and cell sorting
Lung cells were isolated as described in (71) Briefly, mice were euthanized and perfused. 2 ml of
warm dispase solution (5mg/ml) were instilled into the lungs followed by 0.5ml of 1% low-melt
agarose (Sigma #A9414) at 40°C, and allowed to solidify on ice. Inflated lungs were incubated in
dispase solution, for 30’ at RT. The lungs were then physically dissociated, incubated 10’ with
DNAse I 50 μg/ml and filtered through 100μm and 70μm strainers. Red blood cells were lysed
using ACK buffer. Single cell suspensions were stained for live/dead using Zombie Red or Zombie
Violet, and then with antibodies against surface antigens diluted in PBS + BSA 0.2% for 20
minutes at 4°C. Cells were then washed, fixed with 3.7% paraformaldehyde for 10 minutes at
room temperature, washed again and resuspended in PBS + BSA 0.2%. Samples were acquired
on a BD LSRFortessa flow cytometer and data were analyzed using FlowJo v.10 software (BD
Biosciences). CountBright Absolute Counting Beads (Invitrogen #C36950) were used to quantify
absolute cell numbers.

For cell sorting, FACS samples were prepared as described above, and sorted on Sony MA900
Cell Sorter following the sorting strategy indicated in Fig. S12. The sorted cells were collected
directly into TRI Reagent for RNA extraction. For detecting cell proliferation, fixed cells were
treated to assess for 5-Ethynyl-2′-deoxyuridine (EdU) incorporation as described below
(‘Epithelial cell proliferation’) before being stained with antibodies against cell-surface antigens.
Intracellular staining of Ki67 and p21 were carried out using FoxP3 Fix/Perm Buffer set (Biolegend
#421403) following the manufacturer’s instructions.

Epithelial cell proliferation
Proliferation of lung epithelial cells was monitored by assessing the incorporation of EdU (100
mg/kg, intraperitoneally, 12h before end-point euthanasia), and analyzed by flow cytometry or
histology. Briefly, single cell suspensions of lung cells from mice injected with EdU were isolated
as described before (‘Flow cytometry and cell sorting’). Single cell suspensions were assessed
for live/dead and fixed using 3.7% PFA. Staining for EdU was carried out by Click-chemistry
reaction. Fixed cells were permeabilized with 0.1% Triton X100 (Millipore-Sigma) for 15 min. After
permeabilization cells were washed and incubated with 4 mM Copper sulphate (Millipore-Sigma),
100 mM Sodium ascorbate (Millipore-Sigma) and 5 μM sulfo-Cyanine3-azide (Lumiprobe
#A1330) in Tris Buffered Saline (TBS) 100mM, pH 7.6, for 30 min at room temperature.

Ion Torrent
For targeted transcriptome sequencing, 20 ng of RNA isolated from sorted cells was retrotranscribed to cDNA using SuperScript VILO cDNA Synthesis Kit (ThermoFisher Scientific).
Barcoded libraries were prepared using the Ion AmpliSeq Transcriptome Mouse Gene Expression
Kit as per the manufacturer’s protocol and sequenced using an Ion S5 system (ThermoFisher
Scientific). Differential gene expression analysis was performed using the Transcriptome Analysis
Console (TAC) software with the ampliSeqRNA plugin (ThermoFisher Scientific).

Genes were called expressed (n=11,294) if they had average log2 expression of 2 or greater in
either WT or Ifnlr1-/-. Differentially expressed genes (DEGs) between WT and Ifnlr1-/- were
selected by thresholding on fold change (+/-1.5) and p value (0.005). In heatmaps, DEGs were
Z-scaled and clustered (Euclidean distance, Ward linkage). Pathway analysis was performed with
the R package hypeR, using Gene Set Enrichment Analysis on genes ranked according to their
Log2(Fold Change).

Cell culture
FLT3L-DCs were differentiated from bone marrow cells in Iscove’s Modified Dulbecco’s Media
(IMDM; Thermo Fisher Scientific), supplemented with 30% B16-FLT3L derived supernatant and
10% fetal bovine serum (FBS) for 9 days.
Differentiated cells were stimulated with poly (I:C), R848, or 3p-hpRNA. Where indicated poly
(I:C) and 3p-hpRNA were transfected with Lipofectamine 300 (Invitrogen #L3000015) according
to manufacturer’s instructions at the concentrations indicated in the figure legends. Where
indicated poly (I:C) stimulated cells were pre-treated with 10μg/ml chloroquine for 5 minutes prior
to stimulations.

qRT-PCR and ELISA
RNA was isolated from cell cultures using a GeneJET RNA Purification Kit (Thermo Fisher
Scientific #K0731) according to manufacturer’s instructions. RNA was extracted from excised
lungs by homogenizing them in 1ml of TRI Reagent. RNA was isolated from TRI Reagent samples
using phenol-chloroform extraction or column-based extraction systems (Direct-zol RNA
Microprep and Miniprep, Zymo Research #R2061 and #R2051) according to the manufacturer’s
protocol. RNA concentration and purity (260/280 and 260/230 ratios) were measured by
NanoDrop (ThermoFisher Scientific).

Purified RNA was analyzed for gene expression on a CFX384 real-time cycler (Bio-Rad) using a
TaqMan RNA-to-CT 1-Step Kit (Thermo Fisher Scientific) or SYBR Green (Bio-Rad). Probes
specific for Ifnl2/3, Ifnb1, Il1b, Rsad2, Gapdh were purchased from Thermo Fisher Scientific,
and SYBR-Green primers for Rsad2, Cxcl10, Gapdh were purchased from Sigma. Cytokine
analyses were carried out using homogenized lung supernatants, and cell supernatants from
stimulated FLT3L-DCs. IFNλ2/3 ELISA (R&D Systems DY1789B) and mouse IFNβ, IL1β, IL-6,
TNFα ELISA (Invitrogen) were performed according to manufacturer’s instructions.

Clinical samples
Bronchoalveolar lavages (BAL) were obtained from five intensive care unit (ICU)-hospitalized
SARS-CoV-2-positive patients. In parallel, five naso-oropharyngeal swabs were collected from
both SARS-CoV-2-positive and -negative subjects. Among positive patients, two were
hospitalized but without the need of ICU support, whereas three out of five did not require any
hospitalization. The negative swabs were obtained from subjects undergoing screening for
suspected social contacts with COVID-19 subjects. Swabs were performed by using
FLOQSwabs® (COPAN) in UTM® Universal Transport Medium (COPAN). All samples were
stored at -80°C until processing. The study involving human participants was reviewed and
approved by San Raffaele Hospital IRB in the COVID-19 Biobanking project. The patients
provided written informed consent.

RNA extraction protocol and Real-Time PCR of clinical samples
RNA extraction was performed by using PureLink™ RNA Thermo Fisher Scientific according to
manufacturers’ instruction. In particular, 500 µL for each BAL and swab analyzed sample were
lysed and homogenized in the presence of RNase inhibitors. Then ethanol was added to
homogenized samples which were further processed through a PureLink™ Micro Kit Column for
RNA binding. After washing, purified total RNA was eluted in 28 µL of RNase-Free Water.

Reverse transcription was then performed according to SuperScript™ III First-Strand Synthesis
System (Invitrogen™) protocol by using 8 µL of RNA extracted from each BAL and swab sample.
qRT-PCR analysis for was then carried out for evaluating IL6, IL1B, IFNB1, IFNA2, IFNL1 and
IFNL2 expression. All transcripts were tested in triplicate for each sample by using specific
primers. GAPDH was also included. Real-time analysis was then performed according to
manufacturer instructions by using TaqMan® Fast Advanced Master Mix (Applied Biosystems™
by Thermo Fisher Scientific). Real-Time PCR Analysis was performed on ABI 7900 by Applied
Biosystems.

Statistical Analyses
Statistical significance for experiments with more than two groups was tested with one-way
ANOVA, and Dunnett’s multiple-comparison tests were performed. Two-way ANOVA with Tukey’s
multiple-comparison test was used to analyze kinetic experiments. Two-way ANOVA with Sidak’s
multiple-comparison test was used to analyze experiments with 2 grouped variables (i.e.
treatment, genotype). Statistical significance for survival curves were evaluated with the Log-rank
(Mantel-Cox) test and corrected for multiple comparisons with Bonferroni’s correction. To
establish the appropriate test, normal distribution and variance similarity were assessed with the
D’Agostino-Pearson omnibus normality test using Prism8 (Graphpad) software. When
comparisons between only two groups were made, an unpaired two-tailed t-test was used to
assess statistical significance. To determine the sample size, calculations were conducted in
nQuery Advisor Version 7.0. Primary outcomes for each proposed experiment were selected for
the sample size calculation and sample sizes adequate to detect differences with an 80% power
were selected. For animal experiments, four to ten mice per group were used, as indicated in the
figure legends.

Figure S12. Sorting and cytofluorimetry strategy. Depiction of gating strategy for cell sorting.
Cells were gated on FSC and SSC to eliminate debris, on FSC-A -FSC-H to select single cells
and cells negative for live/dead dye and Lineage markers (CD3, CD19, Ter119). Epithelial cells
were gated as CD45- EpCAM+CD31-. The EpCAM- cells were sorted for immune cells as
follows: aMac were gated as CD45+Ly6g-CD11chiSiglec-F+, monocytes and monocyte-derived
cells (Mo) were gated as CD45+Ly6g-Siglec-F-Ly6C+, cDCs were gated as CD45+Ly6g-Siglec-FLy6C-CD11c+MHC-IIhi.
