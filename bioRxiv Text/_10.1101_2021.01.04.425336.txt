Coinfection with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) and other
viruses is inevitable as the COVID-19 pandemic continues. This study aimed to evaluate cell lines
commonly used in virus diagnosis and isolation for their susceptibility to SARS-CoV-2. While
multiple kidney cell lines from monkeys were susceptible and permissive to SARS-CoV-2, many
cell types derived from human, dog, mink, cat, mouse, or chicken were not. Analysis of MDCK
cells, which are most commonly used for surveillance and study of influenza viruses,
demonstrated that they were insusceptible to SARS-CoV-2 and that the cellular barrier to
productive infection was due to low expression level of the angiotensin converting enzyme 2
(ACE2) receptor and lower receptor affinity to SARS-CoV-2 spike, which could be overcome by
over-expression of canine ACE2 in trans. Moreover, SARS-CoV-2 cell tropism did not appear to
be affected by a D614G mutation in the spike protein.

INTRODUCTION:

Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) has resulted in more than 70 million laboratory confirmed
cases and more than 1.6 million deaths in less than a year since the first case was confirmed.
Coinfection with SARS-CoV-2 and other viruses, such as influenza virus, has been reported (14). As cases of COVID-19 continue to climb sharply, more coinfections are expected, especially
in the current and future influenza seasons.

Isolation and propagation of virus from clinical specimens in cell cultures or embryonated chicken
eggs are widely used for virus diagnosis and vaccine production, mostly under biosafety level 2
(BSL2) containment. Currently, SARS-CoV-2 should only be isolated and propagated under BSL3
containment due to its risk to laboratorians and the general public. Therefore, if any of these cell
lines or eggs support productive replication of SARS-CoV-2, then a validated procedure should
be implemented to rule out the presence of SARS-CoV-2 in the specimens prior to their
inoculation. However, adding a diagnostic step specific to SARS-CoV-2 in many circumstances
is impractical or substantially increases the cost and labor required.

We conducted the present study to determine whether cell lines and eggs commonly used for
isolation and propagation of influenza virus, poliovirus and other human viruses can support
productive replication of SARS-CoV-2. If a substrate is confirmed to be insusceptible to SARSCoV-2, modification of procedures for diagnosis and isolation of susceptible viruses in that
substrate may be unnecessary. While all results were repeated under the same or slightly different
conditions, some of our results were further confirmed using two divergent SARS-CoV-2 strains,
with multiple assay methods, and in cell lines from different sources.

Our study provides important information on the risk of inadvertent propagation of SARS-CoV-2
in cell lines and/or substrates when conducting diagnosis, isolation, propagation, or vaccine
production of other viruses.

SARS-CoV-2/USA-WA1/2020 (USA-WA1) was isolated from the specimen of the first confirmed
case in the United States as described previously (5). SARS-CoV-2/Massachusetts/VPT1/2020
(MA/VPT1) was isolated in Vero E6 cells from a nasopharyngeal specimen collected in April 2020.
The recombinant fluorescent reporter virus icSARS-CoV-2-mNG was generated as described
previously (6). The spike gene of all working stocks was sequenced. While USA-WA1 and
MA/VPT1 did not have mutations or variations (at 20% cut off level), icSARS-CoV-2-mNG
acquired a 5-residue insertion at the furin cleavage site resulting in a sequence change from
“PRRARS” to “PRRNIGERARS” in majority of the viral population.

Corporation (San Diego, CA) in pre-seeded 24-well plates except for CRFK and RhMK cells,
which were obtained in T-75 flasks and seeded into 24-well plates in the lab one day prior to

Cells were seeded in 6-, 12-, or 24-well plates a day prior to infection or used directly upon receipt
from a commercial source (Quidel). Infection dose for each experiment is specified in the results
section or figure legends. Infection temperature was always 37oC. In general, inoculum was saved
for back titration and the result was shown as 0 hours post inoculation (hpi) in some figures. Cells
were then washed at 1-2 hpi and supernatants or cell lysates were collected daily for at least 3
days and up to 5 days for infectious virus titration and for viral RNA quantification, respectively.
Cytopathic effect (CPE) and fluorescence signals (for icSARS-CoV-2-mNG) were observed daily.

Specific-pathogen-free (SPF) embryonated chicken eggs were obtained from Charles River
Laboratories (North Franklin, CT, USA). USA-WA1 was inoculated into the allantoic cavity of 24
8- to 12-day-old eggs at 105 TCID50/egg and incubated at 37°C for 3 days. Allantoic fluid was
collected from individual eggs separately as E1 samples. One hundred µl of each E1 sample was
passaged into a corresponding egg and 24 E2 samples were collected after 3 days of incubation.
Similarly, 24 E3 samples were generated from passage of E2 samples in 24 eggs. All E1, E2, and
E3 samples, as well as samples from cell lines, were titrated by TCID50 assay and viral RNAs
were quantified by real-time reverse transcription PCR (rRT-PCR) assay (7). Synthetic RNA was
used in the rRT-PCR assay to generate the standard curve for absolute quantification.

As the prevalence of SARS-CoV-2 infection increases during the pandemic, or when socialdistancing restriction is relaxed in the post-pandemic era, additional coinfections with various
human viruses are inevitable. Therefore, we assessed 25 cell substrates commercially available
from Quidel (Table 1), some of which are widely used for virus diagnosis in clinical laboratories.
The cells were seeded in 24-well plates and inoculated with 5x104 TCID50/well of a fluorescent
reporter virus in which the ORF7a gene was replaced by the mNeonGreen gene (icSARS-CoV2-mNG), allowing successful infection to be visualized by green fluorescence signal (6). Almost
all non-human primate cell lines in this panel were susceptible to icSARS-CoV-2-mNG infection
except for CV-1 cells (Figure 1). In contrast, none of the human, mouse, mink, dog, or cat cell
lines tested yielded fluorescent cells after infection. The Super-E Mix cells were likely susceptible
because this cell culture is a mixture containing BGMK cells, which were found to be susceptible
to SARS-CoV-2 (Figure 1). We then inoculated all these cell lines with 5x104 TCID50/well of the
wild type SARS-CoV-2/USA-WA1/2020 (USA-WA1) strain and titrated supernatants collected
over 5 days. Consistent with the results from icSARS-CoV-2-mNG infection, all non-human
primate cell lines except CV-1 cells supported productive virus replication, whereas all other cell
lines failed to generate infectious virus (Figure 2). It should be noted that viral titers in CRFK cells
increased slightly at 2 dpi (Figure 2), suggesting that this cell line may support a low level of
replication. The results along with the cell substrates’ information are summarized in Table 1.

MDCK cells and embryonated chicken eggs are widely used for influenza virus isolation and
propagation. There are multiple lineages or derivatives of MDCK cells used by laboratories for
different types or subtypes of influenza viruses. Some lineages, such as MDCK-SIAT1 and hCK
cells, were genetically modified and cloned from single cells, resulting in altered cell morphology
and enhanced susceptibility to some subtypes of influenza viruses compared to their parental
MDCK cell lines (8, 9). The different lineages of MDCK cells have altered gene expression profiles
and surface glycans, and it is unclear whether that would affect their susceptibility to SARS-CoV2. Therefore, we examined the susceptibility to SARS-CoV-2 in representative lineages of MDCK
cells that are used widely in different laboratories, including MDCK-NBL-2, MDCK-Atlanta, MDCKLondon, MDCK-SIAT1, and MDCK-hCK.

We inoculated Vero E6 cells (as a positive control) and various MDCK cell lines with 5x104
TCID50/well of USA-WA1 and incubated for 1-2 hours at 37oC. Cells were then washed to remove
the inoculum, and influenza virus infection media containing TPCK-trypsin and bovine serum
albumin (BSA) was added to mimic the conditions used in influenza virus isolation. Supernatants
were collected at the indicated times post-infection and viral titers measured. Vero E6 cells
supported robust viral replication and reached peak titer within 2 days (Figure 3A), and infection
killed most cells (data not shown). In contrast, none of the five MDCK cell lines tested supported
SARS-CoV-2 replication. While residual infectious virus was present in some MDCK supernatant
samples at 2 hpi, it was below the limit of detection (LOD) by 1-day post-infection (dpi) and did
not cause any cytopathic effect (CPE) through 5 dpi. Similar experiments were conducted with
the MDCK cell lines in which the infection media contained FBS rather than BSA, and again
SARS-CoV-2 failed to replicate in any of the 5 MDCK cell lines (data not shown but almost
identical to Figure 3A).

Embryonated chicken eggs are another common substrate for influenza virus isolation,
propagation, and vaccine production. We inoculated 24 eggs each with 105 TCID50 of USA-WA1
and blindly passaged the virus in eggs for 3 passages (E1, E2, and E3). Viral titers in the allantoic
fluid of E1, E2, and E3 eggs were below the limit of detection (101.5 TCID50/ml) even in E1 eggs
(data not shown). We then used an rRT-PCR assay to quantify the viral RNA levels in the
inoculum and allantoic fluid samples (7). Viral RNA decreased steadily over the 3 passages in
eggs (Figure 3B). We also inoculated chicken embryo fibroblasts (CEF) with USA-WA1, and no
infectious virus was produced from the cells (Figure 3A). These results clearly demonstrate that
embryonated chicken eggs are not a susceptible substrate for the SARS-CoV-2 replication.

Collectively, the data show that substrates commonly used to culture influenza A and B viruses
are not susceptible to SARS-CoV-2 infection.

From patients potentially infected with polio or enteroviruses, stool specimens are used to
inoculate appropriate cell lines for surveillance. As SARS-CoV-2 virus can infect multiple organs
and tissues and its presence in stool specimens has been reported (10-16), it is important to
determine if cell lines commonly used for polio and enterovirus culture could inadvertently
propagate SARS-CoV-2. Therefore, RD, HeLa, Hep-2C, and L20B cells were inoculated with
USA-WA1 at MOI of 0.1 and incubated for 2 hours after which the inoculum was removed and
cells were washed 3 times to remove residual virus. No CPE was observed over a 4-day period,
and SARS-CoV-2 was not detectable in supernatant collected at 1-4 dpi (data not shown). This

result was confirmed by rRT-PCR of cell lysate, which revealed that the total viral RNA levels
decreased compared to the inoculum, indicating that virus did not efficiently initiate RNA
transcription or replication (Figure 4). These results indicate that cell substrates regularly used for
polio and enterovirus cultures are not susceptible to SARS-CoV-2 infection when cultured under
these standard conditions.

During this study, we noticed that the proportion of naturally circulating virus containing a D614G
substitution in the spike protein was rapidly increasing. The USA-WA1 strain is an early isolate
that expresses spike with D614. To confirm that the cell susceptibility data obtained using this
virus were valid with recent strains, a subset of representative cell lines were inoculated with high
titer (5x105 TCID50/well) of SARS-CoV-2/Massachusetts/VPT1/2020 (MA/VPT1), which encodes
a spike with G614. In selection of cell lines for the subset, we included Vero E6 cells as a cell line
that should support replication of MA/VPT1 given our previous findings with USA-WA1 (Figure
3A). Indeed, Vero E6 cells supported similar replication kinetics for MA/VPT1 as USA-WA1
(Figure 5A). Even with a 10-fold higher inoculum of MA/VPT1 than previously used for USA-WA1
tests (5x104 TCID50/well) , CV-1, A549, Mv1Lu, MDCK-NBL-2, and MDCK-SIAT1 cell lines were
not susceptible to this SARS-CoV-2 strain encoding spike-G614. CRFK cells inoculated with
MA/VPT1 generated virus titers slightly above the LOD at 1 dpi, after which titers decreased
(Figure 5A). Viral titers were further confirmed by rRT-PCR. Similar to the virus titer data,
inoculated CRFK cells had a 5-fold increase of viral RNA at 1 dpi compared to 2 hpi, but the RNA
levels decreased over the next two days. In contrast, CV-1, A549, Mv1Lu, MDCK-NBL-2, and
MDCK-SIAT1 cells did not shown any noticeable increase of viral RNA levels during the time
course of this study (Figure 5B). All the 7 cell lines in this subset demonstrated very similar viral
replication kinetics for both MA/VPT1 and USA-WA1 virus strains (Figures 2-5), indicating that
the currently dominant virus strains with spike-G614 likely have the same cell susceptibility profile
as earlier strains encoding spike-D614.

Coronavirus spike-host receptor interactions play the major role in species specificity (17). SARSCoV-2 uses human angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (hACE2) as the host cell receptor (18).
Multiple species including humans, monkeys, cats, minks, ferrets, hamsters, and dogs have been
infected by SARS-CoV-2 in experimental and/or natural settings (19-24). To further investigate
the mechanism of susceptibility or resistance and gain insight into SARS-CoV-2 species
specificity, we analyzed the ACE2 expression levels in various cell lines. Multiple anti-ACE2
antibodies were screened to identify a polyclonal antibody that reacts with ACE2 from African
Green Monkey (Vero and CV-1), Mink (Mv1Lu), Canine (MDCK), and feline (CRFK) (data not
shown). Using this antibody, we determined by immunoblot that endogenous ACE2 levels were
very high in Vero E6 cells derived from African Green Monkey kidney but extremely low in the
other African green monkey kidney cell line CV-1, which could explain the drastic difference in
infectivity between these two cell lines. Canine ACE2 protein was not detectable in MDCK cells,
which surely plays a role in their resistance to SARS-CoV-2 infection. Similarly, the feline CRFK,
mink Mv1Lu and human A549 cells had very low or undetectable endogenous ACE2 expression
(Figure 6). The low protein levels of ACE2 in those cells coincided with low mRNA levels
determined by rRT-PCR (data not shown).

Since MDCK cells are the most important cell line for influenza virus isolation and propagation
and dogs have been infected with SARS-CoV-2, we selected canine ACE2 (cACE2) for additional
analysis. To better understand resistance of MDCK cells to SARS-CoV-2, constructs coexpressing ACE2 protein (hACE2 or cACE2) under a CMV promoter and mCherry2 protein
through an IRES element were transfected into MDCK-SIAT1 cells. MDCK cells expressing
hACE2 (MDCK-hACE2) or cACE2 (MDCK-cACE2) as determined by mCherry2 expression were
efficiently infected by icSARS-CoV-2-mNG (Figure 7A). As a control, MDCK cells were also
transfected with an empty vector plasmid that expresses mCherry2 via the IRES element but does
not encode an ACE2 protein (MDCK-vector). Consistent with wild type MDCK cells the MDCKvector control cells were not susceptible to SARS-CoV-2 (Figure 7A). These results were further
confirmed by infecting MDCK-hACE2 and MDCK-cACE2 cells with the wild type virus USA-WA1
and assaying viral replication kinetics. Viral infectious titers and viral RNA levels were elevated in
MDCK cells overexpressing either hACE2 or cACE2 relative to MDCK-vector cells (Figure 7B and
7C).

These results indicate that the resistance of MDCK cells to SARS-CoV-2 occurs at the virus entry
step. Once bound, the genome is released, transcribed, translated, replicated and packaged into
particles that bud from infected cells fairly efficiently. However, overexpression of ACE2 in MDCK
cells could result in greater ACE2 expression as compared to most natural cell lines. Thus, even
if cACE2 does not bind the spike protein as efficiently as hACE2, overexpression could facilitate
entry of SARS-CoV-2 into MDCK-cACE2 cells. To determine if cACE2 binding affinity to SARSCoV-2 spike was an additional factor preventing infection of MDCK cells, we conducted bio-layer
interferometry (BLI) assays to compare the binding affinity of spike with cACE2 and hACE2. We
identified that SARS-CoV-2 spike bound to cACE2 (KD = 19.5 nM) 15-fold less efficiently than
hACE2 (KD = 1.30 nM) (Figure 8). The reduced binding affinity to cACE2 is likely a result of the
sequence differences between the hACE and cACE2 in regions directly involved in spike binding
(Figure 9). Thus, both low expression of cACE2 by MDCK cells and low binding affinity of cACE2
to SARS-CoV-2 spike contribute to the resistance of MDCK cells to SARS-CoV-2.

In this study, we determined the SARS-CoV-2 susceptibility of more than 30 cell lines or
derivatives and embryonated chicken eggs. This study corroborates and complements other
susceptibility studies published in the past few months (25, 26). For example, Barr et al. recently
showed that MDCK cells and embryonated eggs do not support productive SARS-CoV-2 infection
(26). The data presented here are consistent with that study, and our infectious virus titration
assay data further showed that SARS-CoV-2 loses infectivity rapidly in cells and eggs, while the
viral RNA levels decreased quite slowly. In addition, the majority of currently circulating strains
contain the D614G substitution in the spike protein, which could impact binding, entry, and/or
species specificity, and viruses with this change were not tested in previous studies. Herein, we
showed that the spike-D614G substitution does not alter cell susceptibility of the cell lines tested
including those with low levels of human (A549), non-human primate (CV-1), mink (Mv1Lu), cat
(CRFK), or dog (MDCK) ACE2. In the future, even in the unlikely event that other spike
substitutions render the binding of spike to cACE2 stronger (Fig 8), the low expression level of
cACE2 in MDCK cells (Figure 6) still poses a high barrier for SARS-CoV-2 to overcome. Therefore,
two independent studies together illustrate that MDCK cells and commonly utilized derivatives are
not susceptible to SARS-CoV-2 and can be safely used for influenza virus isolation, propagation,

virus vaccines do not support replication of SARS-CoV-2.

We expanded our examination to other clinically relevant cell lines used in diagnosis and isolation
of a wide array of human viruses, particularly respiratory viruses (Table 1). While many of those
cells were tested with SARS-CoV-1 virus previously (25, 27-36), it is worth noting that cell
susceptibility conclusions derived from SARS-CoV-1 studies do not always apply to SARS-CoV2. For example, we and others previously showed that Mv1Lu cells supported a moderate level
of SARS-CoV-1 virus replication (31, 34), but they are not susceptible to SARS-CoV-2 replication
as demonstrated in this study. This finding could be justified by the difference in ACE2 binding
positions between SARS-CoV-1 and SARS-CoV-2 (37-40). Considering that mink ACE2 is only
83% identical to human ACE2 (Figure 9), some of the different ACE2 residues may have more
adverse impact on the SARS-CoV-2 entry than on the SARS-CoV-1 entry. This idea does not
necessarily contradict recent reports of SARS-CoV-2 infections among mink on farms (20, 41-44);
ACE2 expression is relatively low in Mv1Lu cells (Figure 6) but likely higher in various epithelial
cells in vivo, enabling productive infection in minks even through a weaker spike-receptor
interaction.

Overall, our study provides important information on multiple cell lines and chicken eggs regarding
their susceptibility to SARS-CoV-2. This study is important from a biosafety standpoint; humans
can be coinfected by multiple pathogens. Specimens collected for testing and culture may contain
SARS-CoV-2 and these data should help laboratories avoid inadvertent propagation. The data on
canine ACE2 shed light on the relationship between SARS-CoV-2 susceptibility and ACE2
receptor affinity (species specificity) and expression level, suggesting that even ACE2 proteins
with a number of substitutions at key residues that contact SARS-CoV-2 spike protein can still
serve as functional receptors when expressed at high levels.

Figure 1. SARS-CoV-2 infects select commercially sourced cell lines. Cell lines were inoculated with the
SARS-CoV-2 reporter virus encoding mNeonGreen (icSARS-CoV-2-mNG) at 5x104 TCID50/well in 24-well
plates, and infected cells were identified by green fluorescence. Microscopy images were captured at 24 hpi
using 10X magnification. Representative images at 1 dpi are shown but similar results were observed through 5
dpi, and all mNeonGreen-negative cell lines remained negative.

Figure 8. Canine ACE2 has lower affinity to SARS-CoV-2 spike protein compared to human ACE2. Biolayer interferometry assay was used to determine the equilibrium dissociation constant (KD) of hACE2 or
cACE2 protein with SARS-CoV-2 spike protein. hACE2 or cACE2 recombinant protein was loaded onto surface
of biosensor at 100 nM and association was conducted at 10-100 nM of S1-Fc for hACE2 and 25-200 nM of S1Fc for cACE2, followed by dissociation.

Figure 9. ACE2 protein sequences vary across species. ACE2 protein sequences from human, rhesus
macaque, African green monkey, cat, dog, American mink, mouse, and chicken were aligned using MUSCLE.
Residues involved in interaction with SARS-CoV-2 spike protein (based on ref (37-40)) are shown using hACE2
numbering, and residues varying from hACE2 are highlighted in yellow. A gap in alignment is indicated with a
dash. Percent identity to hACE2 across the entire protein is shown.
