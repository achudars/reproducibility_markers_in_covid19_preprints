Abstract (no-technical summary)
Virus cause multiple outbreaks, for which comprehensive tailored therapeutic strategies are still
missing. Virus and host cell dynamics are strictly connected, and convey in virion assembly to ensure
virus spread in the body. Study of the systemic behavior of virus-host interaction at the single-cell
level is a scientific challenge, considering the difficulties of using experimental approaches and the
limited knowledge of the behavior of emerging novel virus as a collectivity. This work focuses on
positive-sense, single-stranded RNA viruses, like human coronaviruses, in their virus-individual host
interaction, studying the changes induced in the host cell bioenergetics. A systems-thinking
representation, based on stock-flow diagramming of virus-host interaction at the cellular level, is
used here for the first time to simulate the system energy dynamics. We found that reducing the
energy flow which fuels virion assembly is the most affordable strategy to limit the virus spread, but
its efficacy is mitigated by the contemporary inhibition of other flows relevant for the system.

Summary
Positive-single-strand ribonucleic acid ((+)ssRNA) viruses can cause multiple outbreaks, for which
comprehensive tailored therapeutic strategies are still missing. Virus and host cell dynamics are
strictly connected, generating a complex dynamics that conveys in virion assembly to ensure virus
spread in the body.
This work focuses on (+)ssRNA viruses in their virus-individual host interaction, studying the
changes induced in the host cell bioenergetics. A systems-thinking representation, based on stockflow diagramming of virus-host interaction at the cellular level, is used here for the first time to
simulate the energy dynamics of the system.
By means of a computational simulator based on the systemic diagramming, we identifid host protein
recycling and folded-protein synthesis as possible new leverage points. These also address different
strategies depending on time setting of the therapeutic procedures. Reducing the energy flow which
fuels virion assembly is addressed as the most affordable strategy to limit the virus spread, but its
efficacy is mitigated by the contemporary inhibition of other flows relevant for the system.
Counterintuitively, targeting RNA replication or virion budding does not give rise to relevant systemic
effects, and can possibly contribute to further virus spread. The tested combinations of multiple
systemic targets are less efficient in minimizing the stock of virions than targeting only the virion
assembly process, due to the systemic configuration and its evolution overtime. Viral load and early
addressing (in the first two days from infection) of leverage points are the most effective strategies
on stock dynamics to minimize virion assembly and preserve host-cell bioenergetics.
As a whole, our work points out the need for a systemic approach to design effective therapeutic
strategies that should take in account the dynamic evolution of the system.

interaction between a (+)ssRNA virus and the host cell and therefore addressing effective
intervention strategies.

Systems-thinking diagram of the virus-host interaction
Starting from the knowledge of relevant processes in (+ss)RNA virus replication, transcription,
translation, virions budding and shedding and their energy costs (reported in Supplementary
Methods Table 1), we built up a systems-thinking (ST) based energy diagram of the virus-host
interaction. Figure 1 shows the stock-flow diagram for the system at issue, where each stock was
quantified in terms of embedded energy of the corresponding variable. Symbols are borrowed from
the energy language 51,52: shields indicate the stocks, big solid arrows the processes and line arrows
the flows, whereas dashed lines indicate the controls exerted by the stocks on the processes. All
stocks, flows and processes are expressed in terms of the energy embedded, transmitted and used
during the infection. We used ATP-equivalents (ATP-eq) as energy unit 53 referred to cellular costs,
by using the number of ATP (or GTP and other ATP-equivalents) hydrolysis events as a proxy for
energetic cost

53,54

. The dynamic determination of flows was based on the knowledge of

characteristic time-scales of well-established biological processes (for more details see
Supplementary Methods). The output flows J4 and J5 were set to be effective only if the value of
the respective stocks Q3 and Q5 is higher than a threshold, as represented by the two switch symbols
in the diagram.
The stock Q1 represents the embedded energy of resources addressed to protein synthesis in the
host cell. The dynamics of allocation for protein synthesis depends on the cell bioenergetics, e.g.,
the number of mitochondria, OX-PHOS activity levels, and the cell cycle phase 55-57 (for more details,
see Supplementary Methods). In the absence of virus, energy flows from Q1 (flows J1, J2A and J2B)
to produce short-half-life proteins (stock Q2A) and long-half-life proteins (stock Q2B), whose synthesis,
degradation and secretion follow dynamic stationary conditions. In particular, typical of the
specialized cells such as those of the pulmonary epithelium, there is a flow of proteins destined for
degradation and recycling through the recruitment of autophagic receptors or organelles or
proteasomes (identified in the diagram by the flows J21A and J21B, Supplementary Methods Table
1). The outflow of folded, fully functional proteins addressed to secretion or surface exposure is
represented by flows J20A and J20B, grouped into the flow J20. At the time of infection, the presence
of viral load in the system, expressed by the stocks Q3 (viral RNA content to be used for viral
transcription and translation), Q4 (translated viral proteins content) and Q5 (full assembled virions to
shed virus outside) diverts resources directly from Q1 (through flows J13, J15 and J17) and Q2B (through
flows J23, J25 and J27). Virions shedding is represented by the flows J7 and J50 through the contribution
of the host-flows J17 and J27 (see Figure 1).

From the energy ST diagram, we derived the equations to set up a computer simulator of the system
(Supplementary Methods Table 1). Each flow was represented by an equation to explicit the
dependence of the processes on the various stocks. To this end, we applied the standardized
workflow of systemic modeling (Extended Data Figure 1) 51, typically used to model the dynamics
of resources within a complex system 58. Calibration values were determined for the set of Qi initial
conditions and the set of phenomenological coefficients k, derived from established characteristic
time-scales for each process in the diagram (further details and references are available in
Supplementary Methods).
First, we investigated the system dynamics under different initial conditions, exploring the possible
role of different initial viral loads (Figure 2). In the configuration of initial null viral load (Q3 stock
value=0) the value of stocks Q1, Q2A and Q2B were constant and the system behavior was stationary
(Figure 2A). Assuming a different viral loads (time zero) in the 10-10,000 virions range, we found
that there is a threshold in the initial viral load for triggering the progressive reduction of Q1, whose
amount could in turn trigger the cell death in different ways. Apoptosis is a cellular process requiring
energy, and a deflection in Q1, as shown in Figure 2F, Extended Figure 2 and Supplementary
Methods, suggesting that cell lysis due to energy catastrophe can occur in an infected cell when the
baseline viral load is high (range 5,000-10,000 virions). Progressive increase of initial viral load
contained in Q3 and Q4 stocks interfers with the processes of the host cell, forcing host-proteins Q2B
to favor the production of virions (progressive increase of the Q5 stock value) through increased J23,
J25 and J27 flows (Figure 2B-F). Thus, the Q5 dynamic evolution is significantly dependent on the
initial configuration (baseline amount of Q3, Q4, Q2B and cell bioenergetics, represented by J0 and
baseline Q1 amount). This could favor virions spread to other cells and changing the system output,
with a bulk release of the content of Q5 outside the cell. For a given Q1 basal amount (which
represents a specific phase of cell cycle, since Q1 by definition is the amount of ATP-eq allocated
for protein synthesis in the cell) and Q3 (equivalent to 10k virions infection), the configuration of the
system should be therefore simulated at different time points. The behavior of Q1 following different
initial values of Q3 could explain why infections due to hCoVs have a wide incubation time, and in
most cases occur asymptomatic, since in half of the possible configurations no relevant changes in
the host cell energetics were observed. This phenomenon can have clinical implications, providing
a better understanding of the configurations that can favor the action of external driving forces (e.g.,
drugs).

Dynamics of the systems configuration in response to target therapy
When a (+)ssRNA virus enters the single host cell, the Q3 stock is fed, and its proteins can interact
with the host proteome to sustain RNA replication. Based on previous works in the field

59-63

, we

identified a time delay of 2 to 6 hours required to record changes in the Q5 stock. Moreover, the value
of Q5 varies over the time due to changes occurred at a different timepoints in the stocks Q2B, Q3

and Q4. To be effective, a therapeutic strategy should limit the outflows of virions, J7 and/or J50.
However, minimization of J7 seems to be counter-effective in our simulation, due to the increase of
Q5 as consequence of the feedback action in the virus replication (VR) process. The minimization of
J50 prevents the outflow (viral shedding) from Q5 without stopping its growth. At the same time, this
leads to increased resources diverting from Q1 and Q2B that could promote the cell death, with
consequent spread of the virions in the environment.
We applied the search of systemic leverage points by simulations of the diagram dynamics of
multiple scenarios. We evaluated several systemic configurations leading to the minimization of the
Q3 and/or Q5 stock over time upon the action of a generic external driving force (D). We simulated
the effects of full (100%) or partial (50%) reduction of either J3 (flow of energy required for RNA
replication), or J4 (flow of energy required for viral RNA translation), or J5 (flow of energy required for
virions assembly), or J50 (flow of energy required for virions budding), which are typically dependent
on intrinsic viral biological properties. The amount of stocks Q2A and Q2B remained constant in all
simulations, suggesting that the host-cell bioenergetics does not modify protein synthesis, that is
used to feed viral protein synthesis as well.
Full (100%) or partial (50%) reduction of J4 and J50 flows at day 0 did not affect the dynamics of the
system (Extended Data Figures 3 A-E, B-F, D-H and Figure 3, respectively), suggesting that these
are not good leverage points at this timepoint. On the contrary, external driving forces able to half
flows J3 and J5 could induce progressive reduction of Q3, associated to increase in Q1 (Figure 3).
Full reduction of J5 at Day 0 can recover the systems dynamics in a stationary status (Extended
Data Figure 3 C), while a partial reduction can only reduce at each timepoint the stock values of Q4
(Extended Data Figure 3 G) and Q5 (Figure 3). Only reduction in J5 could also reduce Q5 at Day 1,
alone or in combination with reduction of J50 and J21. However, the positive effects on Q1, Q3 and Q5
arising from targeting J5 was mitigated by the combination with reduction of J50 or J21 (Figure 3). The
partial reduction of J21, alone or in combination, did not change significantly the dynamic growth of
Q5, induced increase of Q3 at Day 5, though it could prevent a reduction of Q1, to preserve the cell
bioenergetics and preventing the cell death by ATP lack.

Dynamics of the systems coonfiguration to target therapy given at different times
from infection
We also simulated the effect of applying the same external inputs at different times: after 1
(Extended Data Figure 4), 3 (Extended Data Figure 5) or 5 days (Extended Data Figure 6) from
the initial infection, alone or in combination (Figure 4). Application of external forcing factors at Day
1, Day 3 or Day 5 could affect in a non-linear way the system response, with the largest efficacy
targeting J5 (Figures 4-5). The combination of external driving forces acting on J5 and J21 did not
result to be significantly synergic, while targeting J50 and J21 increased the Q5 stock value instead of
the expected reduction. It is worth stressing that this kind of behavior is a typical systemic feature,
where an intervention on a specific local process may lead to counterintuitive rearrangements in the

system dynamics as a whole. Late suppression of J5 and J50 at Day 5 could reduce only the stock
values of Q4. Only early full reduction of J5 (by Day 1) could significantly limit the growth of Q5, while
the combination of contemporary suppression of J5 and J50 could not prevent Q5 growth (Figure 5).
Thus, application of external driving forces at different timepoints is expected to model additional
resilience configurations.

Discussion
In this work, we approached the host-virus interaction dynamics as a systemic problem and, for the
first time in the field, we used combined Systems Thinking tools as a conceptual framework to build
up a systemic description of the viral action and host response, critically depending on the existing
metabolic environment. The complex dynamic behavior was described in terms of underlying
accessible patterns, hierarchical feedback loops, self-organization, and sensitive dependence on
external parameters, that were analytically computed by a simulator. The following novelties were
addressed: i) the use of energy language as a common quantitative unit for different biological
elements in modelling cell-virus dynamics co-evolution; ii) the description of the virus infection
dynamics in terms of systemic interaction between virus and host cell stocks, that are included in the
same system; iii) the use of a dynamical simulator, that can describe the evolution of cell infection
under different conditions; iv) the setting up of a model for different systemic responses to external
driving forces (e.g., drugs), that identify different leverage points.
In general, our results address the conceptualization of diseases as complex systems, like in the
case of cancer 64,65. In fact, the multiple interactions between virus RNA and host cells operate as a
dynamic system, capable to overcome the action of external driving forces. This systemic behavior
is a major obstacle in the understanding of how developing novel therapies 66. Infection works across
a range of intertwined spatial and temporal (hours to days) scales

32

, suggesting that a description

able to connect all the levels at which the infection proceeds is needed 49.
The presence of a (+)ssRNA-virus stock within the system is one of the possible self-organized
patterns (configurations) of a single cell. The virus-host co-evolution

67

was represented as an

evolving pattern, to which the RNA-virus has given access, using pre-existing stocks, processes and
flows of the host cell. Conversely, healthy host-cell dynamics can be represented through a transient
stationary state of relevant stocks (i.e., Q1, Q2A and Q2B). The use of energy as key parameter in
modelling the virus-host co-evolution, at the level of the single cell, complies with the medical
literature evidence, showing the relevance of energy as a descriptor of biosystems in medicine 68-71.
Addressing the requirement of a poly-target approach

72

, our work implemented the description of

virus energetics, previously given in terms of predicted energy use in different steps of the viral
evolution 53,73. Our observations were indirectly confirmed by the data recently published by Gordon
et al., who cloned, tagged and expressed 26 of 29 SARS-CoV-2 proteins individually in HEK293T
cells and used mass spectrometry to measure protein–protein interactions 6. With this experimental
approach, they identified 332 interactions between viral and host proteins, and noted 69 existing
drugs, known to target host proteins or associated pathways, which interact with SARS-CoV-2,
addressing the importance to target the host-virus interaction at the level of RNA translation.
There are known advantages of in silico modelling the action of therapeutic agents on known
diseases through

agent-based modelling

limitations on the choice of parameters, like the size of investigated populations

problems are related to model validation 75,76, also requiring to supplement the models with adequate
formal ontologies 77. Thanks to its abstract nature, stock-flow description can be used in a wide range
of different fields, realizing the conceptual bridge that connects the language of biological systems
to that of ecology.
Our approach unveils the potential of systems thinking for the study of other diseases or classes of
disease, since it appears more and more clear how some incurable pathologies can be described
only by adopting a more comprehensive systemic approach, in which the network of relationships
between biological elements are treated in quantitative way similar to that applied in this paper.

Methods
The method used to study the dynamics of the virus-host interaction system is structured in 3 basic
steps, namely, the development of a flow-stock diagram, that describes the virus-host interactions,
the development of a virus-host systemic simulator, and, finally, its calibration and validation
(Extended Data, Figure 1).
Development of the stock-flow diagram
A typical Systems Thinking diagram is formed of stocks, flows and processes. Stocks are
countable extensive variables Qi, i=1,2,...,n, relevant to the study at issue, that constitute an n-ple
of numbers that at any time represents a state of the system. A stock may change its value only
upon its inflows and/or its outflows, represented by arrows entering or exiting the stock. Processes
are any occurrence capable to alter – either quantitatively or qualitatively – a flow, by the action of
one or more of the system elements. In a stationary state of the system, stocks values are either
constant or regularly oscillating. In the dynamics of a system, stocks act as shock absorbers, buffers,
and time-delayers. Processes are all what happens inside a system that allows the stationarity of its
state, or that may perturb the state itself. To occur, a process must be activated by another driver,
acting on the flow where the process is located. These interaction flows may be regarded as flows
of information, that control the occurring processes and so the value and nature of the matter flows.
The pattern of the feedbacks acting in the system configurations is the feature that utlimately defines
the systems dynamics.
Development of the systemic simulator
We adopted an energyy approach, where stocks, flows and processes are expressed in terms of the
energy embedded, transmitted and used, respectively, during the system operation. The equations,
that characterize the flows relevant to the diagram, are typical of dynamic ST analysis 51,78, and their
setting up is linked in many respects to the energy network language 79. In this approach, each flow
depends on the state variables Qi by relationships of the kind dQi/dt=kf(Qj), i,j=1,...,n, where n is the
number of stocks in the system. Given a set of proper initial conditions for the stocks (i.e., the initial
system state) and a properly chosen set of phenomenological coefficients k, the set of
interconnected equations will be treated by standard finite-different method, taking care of choosing
a time-step short enough to evidence the possible dynamics of any of the studied processes. The
coefficients ki are calculated using data on the dynamics of any single stock, in particular, by
estimating the flows and the stocks during the time interval set for the simulation steps (as described
in Supplementary Methods). When different flows co-participate in a process, a single coefficient
will gather all the actions that concur to the intensity of the outcoming flow(s). These
phenomenological coefficients are not, therefore, related to specific biophysical phenomena or
processes, but are set to describe how and how fast any part of the system react to a change in any
of the other ones. In general, our model may be then regarded as based on a population-level model

(PLM) as defined by 80, which can be run at different scales from organism to sub-cellular ones (see
for example

58,81,82

), that already increased the existing knowledge on the life cycle of different

infections, like for example the ones generated by HIV and Hepatitis C virus

83

. To obtain the

simulations, we used the open-source computation software SCILAB (https://www.scilab.org).
Calibration and validation of the simulator
The model simulations are developed based on the choice of the initial stock conditions, as well as
of the parameters ki (see Supplementary Information for further details). A model is valid as far as
its output reproduces the reality, and systems modelling must be tested under two aspects,
concerned with the capability to correctly describe the system and its dynamics, respectively 84. The
former aspect has to do with the completeness of the choice of stocks and of inflows-outflows
structure. The latter is related to the completeness and the correctness of the relationships between
the stocks, i.e., the setting up of the equations that represent the matter flows as well as the control
actions that the stocks exert on processes. A single comprehensive procedure for the of validation
of all dynamic models however does not exist

85

, since the validity of a well-made model is anyway

dependent also on its usefulness, referred to the very purpose of the model itself. Knowledge in the
field must guide the setting up of the model, in order to legitimate the choice of the elements that
form the systemic simulator (see Supplementary Materials for further details). This was done using
both information from existing knowledge on the biological mechanisms at issue, and experimentbased calculations, that allow to the identification of the variables and parameters necessary to set
up the equations describing the system dynamics. This evaluation procedure encompasses both the
static features and the dynamics of the system. In our case, the first fundamental test was the
verification of the prediction of a stationary state for the values of the stocks of the system in the
absence of contagion, i.e., when no competition is occurring between virus and the host. The model
itself was set up by an iterative process, in which the scientific medical knowledge about the virus
was used to draw a first model, then converted to a simulator, refined and integrated by testing its
ability to simulate real data and the actual evolution of the disease under different conditions. The
reliability of both available data and modelling were tested by evaluating the variation of the model
output upon “artificial” changes of each of the most relevant input data. Some of these numbers are
affected by relatively high uncertainties. Thus, a sensitivity analysis was performed on the outcome
of the simulations, testing to what extent a possible variation on these values lead to incorrect
evaluation of the system dynamics. For this reason, we applied a 50% variation (either positive or
negative), in different combinations, to the parameters on which the results are more sensitive. As
expected, the corresponding simulations vary as well, but the general dynamics of any of them
resulted unchanged, especially concerning the overall trends shown by comparing the groups of
simulation, as in the figures presented in this work.

Figures legend
Figure 1. The energy systemic diagram of a cell infected by ss+RNA virus
Stock-flow diagram of the virus-host interaction system. In the upper right box are the meaning of
symbols. The color code is: blue for host cell energy stocks and relative inflows and outflows; red for
virus energy stocks and relative inflows and outflows; green for external energy inputs and external
driving forces F corresponding to different therapic strategies. The lower box lists the biological
contents of the stocks, all expressed in terms of energy (ATP-equivalent units).
Figure 2. Effects of initial viral load on the energy dynamics of a cell infected by a ss+RNA
virus
Stock values, expressed in ATP-eq, are shown from Day 0 Time 0 from infection as a function of
different initial viral loads (Initial Q3 values respectively: A=0 virions, B=10 virions, C=100 virions,
D=1,000 virions, E=5,000 virions, F=10,000 virions). Color codes for each stock is addressed on the
bottom.

Extended data
Extended Data Figure 1. Workflow of study design
In order to set up suitable diagram simulators and so to operate quantitative analyses, a proper
knowledge of the biology of the system is necessary, along with reliable and comprehensive data
sets (medical knowledge). Once defined the boundary conditions, stocks, flows and processes are
included in the ST diagram. An inventory including the initial values, expressed in the same unit of
measure, and the phenomenological coefficients required for the differential equations that make the
simulator runs. Resulting simulations are compared with the experimental observations and
validated by knowledge in the field.
Extended Data Figure 2. Early and late changes in stocks values based on viral load at Day 0
Time change of the stocks values, expressed in ATP-eq, from infection (Day 0, Time 0) through the
next 7 days, using different initial values in Q3 (amount of 1,000-5,000-10,000 virions, expressed in
ATP-eq). The difference between the value at Day 0, Time 0 and that after 48 hours (at the end of
Day 1) or 144 hours (at the end of Day 5) is plotted for each stock.
