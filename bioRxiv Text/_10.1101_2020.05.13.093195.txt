Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) emerged in December

21

20191,2 and is responsible for the COVID-19 pandemic3. Vaccines are an essential

22

countermeasure urgently needed to control the pandemic4. Here, we show that the

23

adenovirus-vectored vaccine ChAdOx1 nCoV-19, encoding the spike protein of SARS-

24

CoV-2, is immunogenic in mice, eliciting a robust humoral and cell-mediated response.

25

This response was not Th2 dominated, as demonstrated by IgG subclass and cytokine

26

expression profiling. A single vaccination with ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 induced a humoral and

27

cellular immune response in rhesus macaques. We observed a significantly reduced viral

28

load in bronchoalveolar lavage fluid and respiratory tract tissue of vaccinated animals

29

challenged with SARS-CoV-2 compared with control animals, and no pneumonia was

30

observed in vaccinated rhesus macaques. Importantly, no evidence of immune-enhanced

31

disease following viral challenge in vaccinated animals was observed. ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 is

32

currently under investigation in a phase I clinical trial. Safety, immunogenicity and efficacy

33

against symptomatic PCR-positive COVID-19 disease will now be assessed in randomised

34

controlled human clinical trials.

35

36

Main

37

We previously demonstrated that a single dose of ChAdOx1 MERS, a chimpanzee adeno

38

(ChAd)-vectored vaccine platform encoding the spike protein of MERS-CoV, protected non-

39

human primates (NHPs) against MERS-CoV-induced disease5. Here, we designed a ChAdOx1-

40

vectored vaccine encoding a codon-optimised full-length spike protein of SARS-CoV-2

41

(YP_009724390.1) with a human tPA leader sequence, provisionally named ChAdOx1 nCoV-

42

19, similar to the approach for ChAdOx1 MERS5.

Immunogenicity in mice

45

Two mouse strains (BALB/c, N=5 and outbred CD1, N=8) were vaccinated intramuscularly (IM)

46

with ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 or ChAdOx1 GFP, a control vaccine expressing green fluorescent

47

protein. Humoral and cellular immunity were studied 9-14 days later. Total IgG titers were

48

detected against spike protein subunits S1 and S2 in all vaccinated mice (Figure 1a). Profiling of

49

the IgG subclasses showed a predominantly Th1 response post vaccination (Extended Data

50

Figure 1a). Virus-specific neutralising antibodies were detected in all mice vaccinated with

51

ChAdOx1 nCoV-19, whereas no neutralisation was detected in serum from mice vaccinated with

52

ChAdOx1 GFP (Figure 1b). Splenic T-cell responses measured by IFN-γ ELISpot and

53

intracellular cytokine staining (ICS) were detected against peptides spanning the full length of

54

the spike construct (Figure 1c). Again, a strong Th1-type response was detected post vaccination

55

as supported by high levels of IFN-γ and TNF-α, and low levels of IL-4 and IL-10 (Figure 1d &

56

Extended Data Figure 1b-c).

model that displays robust infection of upper and lower respiratory tract and virus shedding upon

70

inoculation with SARS-CoV-26. Twenty-eight days before challenge, 6 animals were vaccinated

intramuscularly with 2.5 x 1010 ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 virus particles each, half of the dose

72

currently administered in human clinical trials. As a control, three animals were vaccinated via

73

the same route with the same dose of ChAdOx1 GFP (Figure 2a). Spike-specific antibodies were

74

present as early as 14 days post vaccination and endpoint IgG titers of 400-6400 were measured

75

on the day of challenge (Figure 2b). Virus-specific neutralising antibodies were detectable in all

76

vaccinated animals before challenge (VN titer = 5-40), whereas no virus-specific neutralising

77

antibodies were detected in control animals (Figure 2c). Finally, SARS-CoV-2 spike specific T-

78

cell responses were detected by IFN-γ ELISpot assay and involved stimulation of peripheral

79

blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) with a peptide library spanning the full length of the spike

Clinical signs

91

Upon challenge with 2.6 x 106 TCID50 SARS-CoV-2 to both the upper and lower respiratory

92

tract the average clinical score of control animals was higher compared to ChAdOx1 nCoV-19

93

vaccinated animals. This was significantly different as determined via Mann-Whitney’s rank’s

94

test on 3 and 5 DPI (Figure 3a). All control animals showed an increase in respiratory rate,

95

compared to 3 out of 6 vaccinated animals. Respiratory signs persisted longer in control animals

96

(Extended Data Table 1).

97

98

Viral load in respiratory tract samples

99

In the control animals, viral genomic RNA (gRNA) was detected in BAL fluid on all days and

100

viral subgenomic RNA (sgRNA), indicative of virus replication, was detected at 3 and 5 days

101

post inoculation (DPI). In contrast, viral gRNA was detected in only two animals, either on 3 or

102

7 DPI, and no viral sgRNA could be detected in BAL fluid obtained from vaccinated animals

103

(p=0.0119, Figure 3b). Viral gRNA was detected in nose swabs from all animals and no

104

difference in viral load in nose swabs was found on any days between vaccinated and control

105

animals (Figure 3c).

118

Cytokines in serum were analysed after challenge to monitor immune responses. We observed an

119

upregulation in IFN-γ at 1 DPI in ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 vaccinated animals, but not in control

120

animals. No significant differences were observed between ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 and control

121

animals for TNF-α , IL-2, IL-4, IL-6, and IL-10 (Extended Data Figure 2).

122

123

Pulmonary pathology

124

At 7 days post inoculation, all animals were euthanized, and tissues were collected. None of the

125

vaccinated monkeys developed pulmonary pathology after inoculation with SARS-CoV-2. All

126

lungs were histologically normal and no evidence of viral pneumonia nor immune-enhanced

127

inflammatory disease was observed. In addition, no SARS-CoV-2 antigen was detected by

128

immunohistochemistry in the lungs of any of the vaccinated animals. Two out of 3 control

129

animals developed some degree of viral interstitial pneumonia. Lesions were widely separated

130

and characterized by thickening of alveolar septae by small amounts of edema fluid and few

131

macrophages and lymphocytes. Alveoli contained small numbers of pulmonary macrophages

132

and, rarely, edema. Type II pneumocyte hyperplasia was observed. Multifocally, perivascular

133

infiltrates of small numbers of lymphocytes forming perivascular cuffs were observed.

134

Immunohistochemistry demonstrated viral antigen in type I and II pneumocytes, as well as in

135

alveolar macrophages (Figure 4).

152

below limits of detection in two vaccinated animals. Viral sgRNA was detected in lung tissue

153

obtained from 1 out of 6 vaccinated animals (p<0.0001, Figure 3d). Viral gRNA could be

154

detected in other tissues but was low in both groups (Extended Data Figure 3).

155

156

Discussion

157

Here, we showed that a single vaccination with ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 is effective in preventing

158

damage to the lungs upon high dose challenge with SARS-CoV-2. Similarly a recent study

159

showed that a triple vaccination regime of a high dose of whole inactivated SARS-CoV-2

160

protected rhesus macaques from SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia7.

161

Viral loads in BAL fluid and lung tissue of vaccinated animals were significantly reduced,

162

suggesting that vaccination prevents virus replication in the lower respiratory tract. Despite this

163

marked difference in virus replication in the lungs, reduction in viral shedding from the nose was

164

not observed. However, animals were challenged with a high dose of virus via multiple routes,

165

which likely does not reflect a realistic human exposure. Whether a lower challenge dose would

166

result in more efficient protection of the upper respiratory tract remains to be determined.

167

Several preclinical studies of vaccines against SARS-CoV-1 resulted in immunopathology after

168

vaccination and challenge, with more severe disease in vaccinated animals than in controls8-10.

169

Importantly, we did not see any evidence of immune-enhanced disease in vaccinated animals.

170

The immune response was not skewed towards a Th2 response in mice nor in NHPs, there was

171

no increase in clinical signs or virus replication throughout the study in vaccinated NHPs

172

compared to controls and no markers of disease enhancement in lung tissue of NHPs, such as an

173

influx of neutrophils were observed. These data informed the start of the phase I clinical trial

174

with ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 on April 23, 2020. As of May 13, 2020, more than 1000 volunteers

175

have participated in the clinical trials. This study is thus an important step towards the

176

development of a safe and efficacious SARS-CoV-2 vaccine.

following the basic principles and guidelines in the NIH Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory

213

Animals, the Animal Welfare Act, United States Department of Agriculture and the United States Public

214

Health Service Policy on Humane Care and Use of Laboratory Animals. Rhesus macaques were housed in

215

individual primate cages allowing social interactions, in a climate-controlled room with a fixed light/dark

216

cycle (12-hours/12-hours) and monitored a minimum of twice daily. Commercial monkey chow, treats,

217

218

consisted of a variety of human interaction, commercial toys, videos, and music. The Institutional

219

Biosafety Committee (IBC) approved work with infectious SARS-CoV-2 virus strains under BSL3

222

Generation of vaccine ChAdOx1 nCoV-19

223

The spike protein of SARS-CoV-2 (Genbank accession number YP_009724390.1), the surface

224

glycoprotein responsible for receptor binding and fusion/entry into the host cell, was codon optimised for

225

expression in human cell lines and synthesised with the tissue plasminogen activator (tPA) leader

226

sequence at the 5’ end by GeneArt Gene Synthesis (Thermo Fisher Scientific). The sequence, encoding

227

SARS-CoV-2 amino acids 2-1273 and tPA leader, was cloned into a shuttle plasmid using InFusion

228

cloning (Clontech). The shuttle plasmid encodes a modified human cytomegalovirus major immediate

229

early promoter (IE CMV) with tetracycline operator (TetO) sites, poly adenylation signal from bovine

230

growth hormone (BGH), between Gateway® recombination cloning sites. ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 was

231

prepared using Gateway® recombination technology (Thermo Fisher Scientific) between the shuttle

232

plasmid described and the ChAdOx1 destination DNA BAC vector described in11 resulting in the

233

insertion of the SARS-CoV-2 expression cassette at the E1 locus. The ChAdOx1 adenovirus genome was

234

excised from the BAC using unique PmeI sites flanking the adenovirus genome sequence. The virus was

235

rescued and propagated in T-Rex 293 HEK cells (Invitrogen) which repress antigen expression during

236

virus propagation. Purification was by CsCl gradient ultracentrifugation. Virus titers were determined by

237

hexon immunostaining assay and viral particles calculated based on spectrophotometry12,13.

Cells and virus

258

SARS-CoV-2 strain nCoV-WA1-2020 (MN985325.1) was provided by CDC, Atlanta, USA. Virus

259

propagation was performed in VeroE6 cells in DMEM supplemented with 2% fetal bovine serum, 1 mM

260

L-glutamine, 50 U/ml penicillin and 50 μg/ml streptomycin. VeroE6 cells were maintained in DMEM

261

supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum, 1 mM L-glutamine, 50 U/ml penicillin and 50 μg/ml

262

streptomycin.

264

Sera were heat-inactivated (30 min, 56 °C), two-fold serial dilutions were prepared in 2% DMEM and

265

100 TCID50 of SARS-CoV-2 was added. After 1hr incubation at 37 °C and 5% CO2, virus:serum mixture

266

was added to VeroE6 cells and incubated at 37°C and 5% CO2. At 5 dpi, cytopathic effect was scored.

267

The virus neutralization titer was expressed as the reciprocal value of the highest dilution of the serum

268

which still inhibited virus replication.

269

RNA extraction and quantitative reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction

270

Tissues (up to 30 mg) were homogenized in RLT buffer and RNA was extracted using the RNeasy kit

271

(Qiagen) according to the manufacturer's instructions. RNA was extracted from BAL fluid and nasal

272

swabs using the QiaAmp Viral RNA kit (Qiagen) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Viral

273

gRNA14 and sgRNA15 specific assays were used for the detection of viral RNA. Five μl RNA was tested

274

with the Rotor-GeneTM probe kit (Qiagen) according to instructions of the manufacturer. Dilutions of

275

SARS-CoV-2 standards with known genome copies were run in parallel.

276

Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay for mouse sera

277

MaxiSorp plates (Nunc) were coated with S1 or S2 (The Native Antigen Company; 50 ng/well) in PBS

278

for overnight adsorption at 4°C. Plates were washed in PBS/Tween (0.05% v/v) and wells blocked using

279

casein (ThermoFisher Scientific) for 1hr at RT. Serially diluted mouse serum samples were added and

280

incubated overnight at 4°C. Plates were washed and Alkaline Phosphatase-conjugated goat anti-mouse

281

IgG (Sigma) was added to all wells for 1hr at RT. After washing pNPP substrate (Sigma) was added.

282

Optical density (OD) values for each well were measured at 405 nm. Endpoint titers were calculated as

283

follows: the log10 OD against log10 sample dilution was plotted and a regression analysis of the linear part

284

of this curve allowed calculation of the endpoint titer with an OD of three times the background. The

285

same calculation was used for diluting the sera to the same amounts of total IgG for further testing on

286

different IgG subclasses with anti-mouse IgG subclass-specific antibodies (Abcam). The results of the

287

IgG subclass ELISA are presented using OD values.

289

Stabilized SARS-CoV-2 spike protein was obtained from the Vaccine Research Centre, Bethesda, USA.

290

Maxisorp plates (Nunc) were coated overnight at 4°C with 100 ng/well spike protein in PBS. Plates were

291

blocked with 100 µl of casein in PBS (Thermo Fisher) for 1hr at RT. Serum serially diluted 2x in casein

292

in PBS was incubated at RT for 1hr. Antibodies were detected using affinity-purified polyclonal antibody

293

peroxidase-labeled goat-anti-monkey IgG (Seracare, 074-11-021) in casein and TMB 2-component

294

peroxidase substrate (Seracare, 5120-0047), developed for 5-10 min, and reaction was stopped using stop

295

solution (Seracare, 5150-0021) and read at 450 nm. All wells were washed 4x with PBST 0.1% tween in

296

between steps. Threshold for positivity was set at 3x OD value of negative control (serum obtained from

297

non-human primates prior to start of the experiment) or 0.2, whichever one was higher.

298

ELISpot assay and ICS analysis

299

Single cell suspension of murine splenocytes were prepared by passing cells through 70μM cell strainers

300

and ACK lysis prior to resuspension in complete media. Rhesus macaque PBMCs were isolated from

301

ethylene diamine tetraaceticacid (EDTA) whole blood using LeucosepTM tubes (Greiner Bio-one

302

International GmbH) and Histopaque®-1077 density gradient cell separation medium (Sigma-Aldrich)

303

according to the manufacturers’ instructions.

304

Mice - For analysis of IFN-γ production by ELISpot, cells were stimulated with pools of S1 or S2

305

peptides (final concentration of 2μg/ml) on IPVH-membrane plates (Millipore) coated with 5μg/ml anti-

306

mouse IFN-γ (AN18). After 18-20 hours of stimulation, IFN-γ spot forming cells (SFC) were detected by

307

staining membranes with anti-mouse IFN-γ biotin (1μg/ml) (R46A2) followed by streptavidin-Alkaline

308

Phosphatase (1μg/ml) and development with AP conjugate substrate kit (BioRad, UK).

309

For analysis of intracellular cytokine production, cells were stimulated at 37oC for 6 hours with 2μg/ml S1

310

or S2 pools of peptide, media or cell stimulation cocktail (containing PMA-Ionomycin, Biolegend),

311

312

313

together with 1μg/ml Golgi-plug (BD) with the addition of 2μl/ml CD107a-Alexa647. Cell supernatant

was collected and frozen at –20C for subsequent analysis by MesoScaleDiscovery (MSD) assay (see
below). Following surface staining with CD4-BUV496, CD8-PerCPCy5.5, CD62L-BV711 and CD127-

314

BV650, cells were fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde and stained intracellularly with TNF-α-A488, IL-2-

315

PECy7, IL-4-BV605, IL-10-PE and IFN-γ-e450 diluted in Perm-Wash buffer (BD).

316

Sample acquisition was performed on a Fortessa (BD) and data analyzed in FlowJo v9 or FlowJo V10

317

(TreeStar). An acquisition threshold was set at a minimum of 5000 events in the live CD3+ gate. Antigen

318

specific T cells were identified by gating on LIVE/DEAD negative, doublet negative (FSC-H vs FSC-A),

319

size (FSC-H vs SSC), CD3+, CD4+ or CD8+ cells and cytokine positive. Cytokine positive responses are

320

presented after subtraction of the background response detected in the corresponding unstimulated sample

321

(media containing CD107a and Golgi-plug) of each individual spleen sample.

322

NHPs - IFN-γ ELISpot assay of PBMCs was performed using the ImmunoSpot® Human IFN- γ Single-

323

Color Enzymatic ELISpot Assay Kit according to the manufacturer’s protocol (Cellular Technology

324

Limited). PBMCs were plated at a concentration of 100,000 cells per well and were stimulated with four

325

contiguous peptide pools spanning the length of the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein sequence at a

326

concentration of 2 µg/mL per peptide (Mimotopes). ELISpot plates were subjected to overnight formalin

327

inactivation prior to removal from BSL4 for reading. Analysis was performed using the CTL

328

ImmunoSpot® Analyzer and ImmunoSpot® Software (Cellular Technology Limited). Spot forming units

329

(SFU) per 1.0x106 PBMCs were summed across the 4 peptide pools for each animal.

330

Measurement of cytokines and chemokines

331

Mouse samples were assayed using MSD Technology V-PLEX Mouse Cytokine 29-Plex kit according to

332

the manufacturer’s instructions. Non-human primate samples were inactivated with γ-radiation (2 MRad)

333

according to standard operating procedures and assayed on a Bio-Plex 200 instrument (Bio-Rad) using the

334

Non-Human Primate Cytokine MILLIPLEX map 23-plex kit (Millipore) according to the manufacturer’s

335

instructions. LLOD was used for all undetectable and extrapolated values. Only data for cytokines

336

consistently above the lower limit of quantification were included in further anlayses.

337

Log10 Fold Change (Log10FC) for mouse samples was calculated as follows:

338

Log10FC = Log10((Stimulated (pg/ml) + 1) / (Unstimulated (pg/ml) + 1))

and is also made available for use under a CC0 license.

339

Fold change for NHP samples was calculated as follows:

340

FC = Concentration (pg/mL) on DX (1, 3, 5, or 7)/Concentration (pg/mL) on D0

341

Histology and immunohistochemistry

342

Necropsies and tissue sampling were performed according to IBC-approved protocols. Lungs were

343

perfused with 10% formalin and processed for histologic review. Harvested tissues were fixed for eight

344

days in 10% neutral-buffered formalin, embedded in paraffin, processed using a VIP-6 Tissue Tek

345

(Sakura Finetek, USA) tissue processor, and embedded in Ultraffin paraffin polymer (Cancer Diagnostics,

346

Durham, NC). Samples were sectioned at 5 µm, and resulting slides were stained with hematoxylin and

347

eosin. Specific anti-CoV immunoreactivity was detected using an in-house SARS-CoV-2 nucleocapsid

348

protein rabbit antibody (Genscript) at a 1:1000 dilution. The IHC assay was carried out on a Discovery

349

ULTRA automated staining instrument (Roche Tissue Diagnostics) with a Discovery ChromoMap DAB

350

(Ventana Medical Systems) kit. All tissue slides were evaluated by a board-certified veterinary anatomic

351

pathologist blinded to study group allocations.

352

Statistical analyses

353

Two-tailed Mann-Whitney’s rank tests were conducted to compare differences between groups. A

354

Bonferroni correction was used to control for type I error rate where required.
