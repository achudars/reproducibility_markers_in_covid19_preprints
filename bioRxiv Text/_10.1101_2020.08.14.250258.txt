Abstract
The severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) causing the current
pandemic, coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), has taken a huge toll on human lives and the
global economy. Therefore, effective treatments against this disease are urgently needed. Here,
we established a fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET)-based high-throughput
screening platform to screen compound libraries to identify drugs targeting the SARS-CoV-2
main protease (Mpro), in particular those which are FDA-approved, to be used immediately to
treat patients with COVID-19. Mpro has been shown to be one of the most important drug
targets among SARS-related coronaviruses as impairment of Mpro blocks processing of viral
polyproteins which halts viral replication in host cells. Our findings indicate that the antimalarial drug tafenoquine (TFQ) induces significant conformational change in SARS-CoV-2
Mpro and diminishes its protease activity. Specifically, TFQ reduces the α-helical content of Mpro,
which converts it into an inactive form. Moreover, TFQ greatly inhibits SARS-CoV-2 infection
in cell culture system. Hence, the current study provides a mechanistic insight into the mode of
action of TFQ against SARS-CoV-2 Mpro. Moreover, the low clinical toxicity of TFQ and its
strong antiviral activity against SARS-CoV-2 should warrant further testing in clinical trials.

Introduction
The SARS-CoV-2 was identified in December 2019 as the cause of COVID-19 outbreak that
originated in Wuhan, China (1-3). It has since spread rapidly, infected more than twelve million
people globally, and caused more than 548,822 deaths (4). Currently, there are no scientifically
proven drugs to control this outbreak. The SARS-CoV-2 genome shares about 83% identity with
the SARS coronavirus that emerged in 2002 and contains approximately 30,000 nucleotides that
are transcribed into 14 open reading frames (Orfs) (5). Among them, Orf1a and Orf1ab are
translated into two polyproteins which are then cleaved by the main protease (Mpro), yielding a
number of protein products required for viral replication and transcription (6-9). Because there
are no similar proteases in humans and that Mpro is necessary for viral replication, Mpro is
considered as an ideal target for drug design. Drugs that are approved by the U.S. Food and Drug
Administration (FDA) undergo rigorous evaluation for quality, safety and effectiveness, and thus
identifying FDA-approved drugs that can inhibit Mpro protease activity has the advantage to be
used quickly for treatment in patients. To this end, we established a fluorescence resonance
energy transfer (FRET)-based high-throughput drug screening platform to rapidly identify
antiviral compounds from the FDA-approved drug library which can bind to Mpro and inhibit its
enzymatic activity.

Results
FRET-based high-throughput screening of FDA-approved compound library for inhibitors
of SARS-CoV-2 Mpro
Recombinant SARS-CoV-2 Mpro (ORF1ab polyprotein residues 3264–3569, GenBank code:
QHD43415.1) was expressed in Escherichia coli and purified to homogeneity (fig. S1). To
rapidly identify potential FDA-approved drugs targeting SARS-CoV-2 Mpro, we established a
fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET) assay by using a protein substrate consisting of
the nsp4-5 N-terminal autocleavage site (TSAVLQ↓SGFRKM) of SARS-CoV-2 Mpro inserted
between mTurquoise2 and mVenus, an enhanced CFP-YFP pair with higher quantum yield and
protein stability (Fig. 1A and fig. S2) (10,11). The decrease in the FRET efficiency following
cleavage of the protein substrate by SARS-CoV-2 Mpro and the increase in time-dependent
fluorescence emission of mTurquoise2 at 474 nm were used as a measurement of Mpro activity.
An initial screening of about 2,000 compounds using this FRET assay showed that tafenoquine
(TFQ) exhibited the most significant inhibitory effect against SARS-CoV-2 Mpro (Fig. 1B).

Mechanism of action of TFQ against SARS-CoV-2 Mpro
TFQ (brand name Krintafel/Kozenis in U.S./Australia, owned and developed by
GlaxoSmithKline) is an 8-aminoquinoline anti-malarial drug that was approved by the U.S. FDA
in July 2018 and the Australian Therapeutic Goods Administration (TGA) in September 2018 for
the radical cure of Plasmodium vivax (12-14), a parasite that causes malaria. In addition, TFQ
(brand name Arakoda/Kodatef in U.S./Australia, owned by 60 Degrees Pharmaceuticals) was
later approved by the FDA and the TGA for malaria prophylaxis (14,15). However, the molecular

target of TFQ is still unknown. Recently, two 4-aminoquinoline derivatives, chloroquine (CQ)
and hydroxychloroquine (HCQ), were shown to be effective in inhibiting SARS-CoV-2 infection
in vitro (16,17). Many clinical trials using CQ or HCQ to treat patients with COVID-19 have
also been reported, but some have found no benefit and possible harm in patients (18,19). CQ is
thought to inhibit virus entry by modifying glycosylation of ACE2 receptor and spike protein or
by interfering with the pH-dependent endocytic pathway (20,21).
To further characterize TFQ, we compared the inhibitory effects of TFQ and HCQ against
SARS-CoV-2 Mpro at various concentrations by FRET and differential scanning fluorimetry
(DSF) (22). As shown in Figure 1c, TFQ exhibited almost 90% inhibition against SARS-CoV-2
Mpro at a concentration of 90 μM whereas HCQ did not demonstrate any significant inhibitory
effects. Using a protein thermal shift assay, we showed that TFQ caused a negative shift in the
melting temperature (Tm) of SARS-CoV-2 Mpro in a dose-dependent manner (Fig. 1, D and E). In
contrast, HCQ had no influence on the thermal stability of SARS-CoV-2 Mpro (Fig. 1, D and F).
DSF is a powerful tool in early drug discovery (22) with the basic principle that drugs which
bind to the therapeutic protein target will stabilize it and cause a positive shift in its Tm.
However, small-molecule inhibitors have been shown to cause negative shifts in the Tm values
of target proteins by disrupting their oligomeric interfaces, leading to thermal destabilization and
subsequent loss of interaction between the protein subunits (23,24). Some examples include 6hydroxy-DL-dopa binding to RAD52 (25) and SPD304 binding to TNF-α (26). In other cases, a
ligand can bind more strongly to the non-native state than the native state of its target protein,
such as that of Zn2+ and porcine growth hormone (27). To test whether TFQ binding disrupts the
dimerization interface or binds to the non-native state of SARS-CoV-2 Mpro, various biophysical
methods were utilized to assess the conformational changes of SARS-CoV-2 Mpro. Analytical

ultracentrifugation studies revealed identical sedimentation coefficient at various concentrations
of TFQ, suggesting the absence of dimer-to-monomer conversion of SARS-CoV-2 Mpro in the
presence TFQ (Fig. 2A). Interestingly, results from circular dichroism (CD) spectroscopy
revealed an increase in the far-UV signals (molar ellipticity at 222 nm) with increasing
concentrations of TFQ, indicating that the total helical content of SARS-CoV-2 Mpro decreased
upon TFQ binding (Fig. 2B). The decreased α-helical content was accompanied by reduced Mpro
protease activity (Fig. 2, B and C). Together, these data suggested that TFQ may cause a local
conformational change within its binding site, disrupting nearby α-helices and subsequently
reducing Mpro’s protease activity (Fig. 2, B and C). Moreover, because the sedimentation
coefficient remained unchanged with TFQ, it is unlikely that TFQ caused unfolding of the
overall structure of SARS-CoV-2 Mpro (Fig. 2A). To confirm this assumption, the solubility and
stability of SARS-CoV-2 Mpro in the presence of different concentrations of TFQ or HCQ were
tested. Consistently, the protein band of SARS-CoV-2 Mpro remain intact at concentration of TFQ
up to 90 μM (Fig. 2D). At concentration above 120 μM TFQ, the soluble fraction of SARSCoV-2 Mpro diminished gradually, suggesting that the conformational change induced by TFQ
may expose some hydrophobic residues and ultimately result in protein aggregation (Fig. 2D).
By contrast, HCQ do not influence the stability of SARS-CoV-2 Mpro at concentration up to 500
μM (Fig. 2D).

To further probe the conformational changes of SARS-CoV-2 Mpro, we performed a limited
proteolysis assay by trypsin digestion (28). The cleavage pattern indicated a greater degree of
protection of SARS-CoV-2 Mpro from trypsin digestion at higher concentrations of TFQ (Fig. 2E).
In contrast, no concentrations of HCQ tested reduced the cleavage of SARS-CoV-2 Mpro by
trypsin digestion (Fig. 2E). Results from binding constant measurement by isothermal titration

calorimetry (ITC) indicated TFQ bound to SARS-CoV-2 Mpro with micromolar affinity (Kd =
~10–5 M, Fig. 2F). These findings further supported the notion that TFQ binding induces local
conformational changes in Mpro that trigger an active-to-inactive form transition, reduce its Tm
and protease activity, and render it more resistant to trypsin digestion.

Binding mode of TFQ to SARS-CoV-2 Mpro
To elucidate the inhibitory mechanism of TFQ against SARS-CoV-2 Mpro, molecular docking
was performed using SwissDock (29). The resulting complex showed that TFQ fits well in the
substrate-binding site of SARS-CoV-2 Mpro (Fig. 3A) and forms three polar contacts with F140,
E166, and the active-site residue C145 (Fig. 3, A and C). In addition, eight residues of SARSCoV-2 Mpro, including H41, M49, L141, N142, S144, H164, M165 and Q189, contribute to the
hydrophobic interface enclosing TFQ in the substrate-binding site (Fig. 3, A and C). To compare
the differences between TFQ and HCQ at the molecular level, we also conducted a docking
analysis of HCQ to SARS-CoV-2 Mpro. Compared with TFQ, HCQ forms only one polar contact
with E166 and fewer hydrophobic interactions within the substrate-binding site of SARS-CoV-2
Mpro (Fig. 3, B and D). The enhanced binding affinity of TFQ to SARS-CoV-2 Mpro may be
attributed to the binding of the 3-(trifluoromethyl) phenoxy moiety of TFQ in the S1′ site of Mpro,
which is absent in the HCQ Mpro docked complex. Recently, the crystal structure of SARS-CoV2 Mpro in complex with a mechanism-based inhibitor N3, was published (30). We compared the
N3 inhibitor-Mpro complex (PDB code: 6LU7) with the TFQ-Mpro docked complex and showed
that TFQ occupies the sites equivalent to P2, P1 and P1′ of the N3 inhibitor in the substratebinding site (Fig. 3E). The S1 subsite of Mpro is highly specific to Gln at the P1 position of
peptide substrate. The pentan-1,4-diamine moiety of TFQ appears to meet this requirement by

mimicking the Gln side chain to form two hydrogen bonds with the side chain of E166 and main
chain of F140 (Fig. 3, C and E). The hydrophobic quinoline core of TFQ is in close proximity to
the S2 subsite, which prefers hydrophobic residues (Fig. 3E). In conclusion, the docking studies
showed that TFQ binds to SARS-CoV-2 Mpro by mimicking its preferred peptide substrate.

TFQ inhibits SARS-CoV-2 production in cell culture system
Since TFQ treatment inactivates SARS-CoV-2 Mpro, a key protease for viral replication in
host cells, we examined the antiviral efficacy of TFQ on the viral production and infection rates
of SARS-CoV-2. Vero E6 cells, which are kidney epithelial cells isolated from an African green
monkey and commonly used to produce SARS-CoV-2 stocks in many research groups (16,31),
were infected with SARS-CoV-2 (strain NTU02, GenBank:MT066176.1) at a multiplicity of
infection (MOI) of 0.001 in the presence of TFQ (2.5 μM and 5 μM) or DMSO (control). Cells
were subjected to two modes of drug treatment, one in which cells were pre-treated with TFQ for
an hour prior to viral infection (full-time treatment), and the other in which cells were treated
with TFQ after virus infection (post treatment) (Fig. 4A). After infection and TFQ treatment, cell
supernatants were collected for further quantification of virus yield on Day 1, Day 2, and Day 3
after infection. The inhibition rate of TFQ against SARS-CoV-2 was determined by measuring
viral RNA of nucleoprotein (N) using quantitative real-time RT-PCR (qRT-PCR). The results
indicated that TFQ significantly repressed the yield of viral RNA in cell supernatant on day 1 to
2 after infection (Fig. 4B). Regardless of the treatment method used, the inhibition rate against
viral RNA production was approximately 0–3.5% and 51.9–54% with 5 μM and 2.5 μM TFQ,
respectively, at 48-hour post infection, implying the half maximal effective concentration (EC50)
of TFQ was around 2.5 μM (Fig. 4C). Viral infection can lead to changes in cell morphology and

death of host cells, also known as cytopathic effect (CPE) (32,33). Vero E6 cells are susceptible
to SARS-CoV-2 infection, which induces CPE (34). We observed a significant decrease in
SARS-CoV2-induced CPE in Vero E6 cells treated with 5 μM TFQ treatment compared with the
DMSO treatment group (Fig. 4D), indicating that TFQ mitigates cell damages caused by SARSCoV-2. Therefore, the data in Figure 4b observed on day 3 showed that there is no significant
difference of viral RNA between DMSO-treated and TFQ (2.5 μM)-treated groups because the
former lacked sufficient number of surviving host cells for virus production. Collectively, these
data demonstrated that TFQ potently reduces SARS-CoV-2 production in the host cells.

Discussion
Drug repurposing is an efficient way to accelerate the development of therapies for COVID19. Here, we identified TFQ as a potent drug that inhibits SARS-CoV-2 replication by targeting
its Mpro from an FDA-approved compound library. We first demonstrated that TFQ inhibits the
enzymatic activity of SARS-CoV-2 Mpro by using a FRET-based assay. Subsequent molecular
docking study indicated that TFQ binds directly to the substrate-binding pocket of SARS-CoV-2
Mpro as a competitive inhibitor. Moreover, binding of TFQ prevented Mpro from trypsin
degradation and induced a negative shift in its Tm, supporting the conversion of SARS-CoV-2
Mpro from an active to inactive form in the presence of TFQ. Using CD spectroscopy, we showed
that increasing TFQ concentrations reduced the α-helical content of Mpro, suggesting possible
unraveling of some α-helices. However, the results from trypsin digestion indicated that TFQ
binding rendered Mpro more resistant to trypsin digestion, which indicates the presence of a more
ordered structure, preventing it from trypsin digestion. In addition, the results from analytical
ultracentrifugation (Fig. 2A) also suggested the formation of an ordered structure of the TFQ-

Mpro complex. Thus, inhibition of Mpro by TFQ seems to convert Mpro from an active to inactive
conformation. This mechanism differs from the typical mechanism of action of inhibitors that
bind to the active site of the enzyme to block substrate binding. Therefore, we proposed a model
shown in Fig. 5, illustrating the possible inhibition mechanism of TFQ on SARS-CoV-2 Mpro.
Based on the results shown in this study, the binding of low concentration (10 to 90 μM) of TFQ
to Mpro decreases its protease activity by reducing the α-helical structure content. The
conformational change may destabilize SARS-CoV-2 Mpro by exposing some hydrophobic
residues to solvent, resulting decreased thermal stability. However, at concentration above 120
μM TFQ, the exposed hydrophobic region of SARS-CoV-2 Mpro may exceed a threshold, leading

to protein aggregation and precipitation. Therefore, TFQ may inhibit the function of Mpro through
a two-step progressive process to reduce SARS-CoV-2 production (Fig. 5).
It is interesting to note that the N3 inhibitor blocked SARS-CoV-2 at a concentration of 10
μM in cell-based assay (30) whereas TFQ exhibited strong antiviral effect at a concentration of 5
μM in SARS-CoV-2 infected Vero E6 cells (Fig. 4). In contrast to TFQ which can be

immediately evaluated in patients with COVID-19 in clinical trials, there is currently no safety,
oral bioavailability, or pharmacokinetics study of N3 inhibitor in patients.
TFQ is approved for prophylaxis and treatment of malaria in the U.S. and Australia (15,35). As a
preventive measure, a dose of 200 mg TFQ is recommended for three days prior to traveling and
200 mg per week until one week after return. For radical cure, a single dose of 300 mg TFQ is
recommended

(https://wwwnc.cdc.gov/travel/news-announcements/tafenoquine-malaria-

prophylaxis-and-treatment). Those above dose recommendations for malaria prophylaxis
suggested that TFQ at higher doses may be tolerated by the human body. Contrary to the long
half-life (one month or longer) and possible severe side effects, such as bulls-eye maculopathy,

dry eye, nausea, diarrhea, anemia, liver failure, and muscle paralysis, of CQ and HCQ, the halflife of TFQ is relatively shorter (~14 days) and the side effects are less severe (36,37). Together
with our data showing that 5 μM TFQ strongly inhibited SARS-CoV-2 infection in vitro (Fig. 4),
especially when applied as TFQ pre-treatment (full-time treatment) to mimic the prophylactic
use against viral infection, the repurposing of TFQ for the prevention and treatment of COVID19 is worth looking into for clinical evaluations.
Although FDA-approved drugs that target Mpro have been identified using virtual docking
methods (38,39), they have not been evaluated for their effects on Mpro protease activity by
functional assays. It is worth mentioning that among those docking-positive candidates, none of
them that we tested (at least 10; Table 1) showed strong inhibitory effects against the Mpro
protease activity. Hence, the current study not only identifies the first anti-SARS-CoV-2 Mpro
drug that has been tested functionally to inhibit Mpro protease activity and evaluated for safety
(FDA-approved drug) but also provides a mechanistic insight into the mode of action of TFQ
against SARS-CoV-2 Mpro. The low clinical toxicity and mechanism-driven antiviral activity of
TFQ against SARS-CoV-2 should warrant further testing in clinical trials.

Materials and Methods
Recombinant protein preparation
The full-length gene encoding SARS-CoV-2 main protease (Mpro, ORF1ab polyprotein residues
3264-3569, GenBank code: MN908947.3) with Escherichia coli codon usage was synthesized
and subcloned into pSol SUMO vector using Expresso® Solubility and Expression Screening
System (Lucigen). A pET16b plasmid encoding the fluorescent protein substrate of Mpro (His10mTurquoise2-TSAVLQSGFRKM-mVenus) was synthesized and constructed for FRET based
high-throughput screening assay. Each expression plasmid was transformed into E. coli BL21
(DE3) and then grown in Luria Broth medium at 37 °C until OD600 reached between 0.6 and 0.8.
Overexpression of Mpro or its fluorescent protein substrate was induced by the addition of 20% Lrhamnose or 0.5 mM IPTG and incubated for 18 hours at 20 °C. The cell pellets were
resuspended in sonication buffer [50 mM Tris-HCl pH 8.0, 500 mM NaCl, 10 % glycerol, 1 mM
tris(2-carboxyethyl)phosphine (TCEP), 1 mM phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride (PMSF)] and lysed
by sonication on ice. Following centrifugation at 28,000 g, 4 °C for 30 min, the supernatant was
loaded onto a HisTrap FF column (GE Healthcare), washed by sonication buffer containing 10
mM imidazole, and eluted with a 20–200 mM imidazole gradient in sonication buffer. An
adequate amount of TEV protease was added to remove the N-terminal SUMO fusion tag of Mpro.
Both TEV protease and His6-SUMO fusion tag were then removed by HisTrap FF column. The
Mpro and its substrate protein were further purified by size-exclusion chromatography and stored
in buffer containing 50 mM Tris-HCl pH 8.0, 200 mM NaCl, 5 % glycerol, and 1 mM TCEP. For
solubility and stability test, SARS-CoV-2 Mpro was incubated with different concentration of
TFQ or HCQ (30-500 μM) at room temperature for 30 mins. After centrifugation at 16000g for 3
mins, 20 ul of the supernatant of was boiled at 95℃ for 10 mins, and analyzed by 10 % SDS-

Small-molecule compound library
Three small-molecule compound libraries, including the FDA-approved Drug Library, Clinical
Compound Library, and Anti-COVID-19 Compound Library (MedChemExpress), were used to
screen for drugs against SARS-CoV-2 Mpro.

Fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET) assay
SARS-CoV-2 Mpro (4 μM) in assay buffer (20 mM Tris-HCl 7.8, 20 mM NaCl) was preincubated with or without 60 μM compounds for 30 min at room temperature in 96-well black
Optiplate. The reaction was initiated by addition of 20 μM fluorescent protein substrate.
Substrate cleavage was monitored continuously for 1 hour by detecting mTurquoise2
fluorescence (excitation: 434 nm / emission: 474 nm) using Synergy™ H1 hybrid multi-mode
microplate reader (BioTek Instruments, Inc.). The first 15 min of the reaction was used to
calculate initial velocity (V0) by linear regression. The calculated initial velocity with each
compound was normalized to DMSO control. The IC50 was calculated by plotting the initial
velocity against various concentrations of TFQ by use of a dose-response curve in Prism 8
software.

Protein thermal shift assay using differential scanning fluorimetry
Differential scanning fluorimetry (DSF) assays were conducted as previously described (Lo, et
al., 2004). Briefly, the experiment was carried out on a CFX96 RT-PCR instrument (Bio-Rad) in
a buffer comprising 25 mM Tris pH 8.0, 150 mM NaCl, 5X SYPRO Orange dye (Sigma-

Aldrich), and 8 μM SARS-CoV-2 Mpro in the presence or absence of 120 μM compound in each
well. Fluorescence was monitored when temperature was gradually raised from 25 to 90 ºC in
0.3 ºC increments at 12-second intervals. Melt curve data were plotted using the Boltzmann
model to obtain the temperature midpoint of unfolding of the protein using Prism 8.0 software
(GraphPad).

Circular dichroism (CD) spectroscopy
CD signals were measured using a Jasco J-815 spectropolarimeter with 0.1-cm quartz cuvettes
and a 1-mm slit width. The molar ellipticity at 222 nm of all samples was recorded to analyze the
protein conformational changes at different concentrations of TFQ (10–500 μM). All spectra
were corrected for buffer absorption.

Analytical ultracentrifugation (AUC)
To assess the quaternary structural changes of SARS-CoV-2 Mpro in the presence of TFQ,
sedimentation velocity experiments were performed using a Beckman Optima XL-A analytical
ultracentrifuge (Beckman Coulter, CA, USA). Before ultracentrifugation, the protein sample was
preincubated with various concentrations of TFQ (50–100 μM) at room temperature for 30 min.
The protein sample and buffer solutions (25 mM Tris 8.0, 150 mM NaCl) were separately loaded
onto the double sector centerpiece and placed in a Beckman An-50 Ti rotor. The experiments
were performed at 20 °C and at a rotor speed of 42,000 rpm. The protein samples were
monitored by the UV absorbance at 280 nm in continuous mode with a time interval of 480 s and
a step size of 0.002 cm. Multiple scans at different time points were fitted to a continuous size
distribution model by the program SEDFIT (Schuck et al., 2002). All size distributions were

solved at a confidence level of p = 0.95, a best fitted average anhydrous frictional ratio (f/f0), and
a resolution N of 250 sedimentation coefficients between 0.1 and 20.0 S.

Limited proteolysis by trypsin
The protein sample was preincubated with various concentrations of TFQ (30–120 μM) at room
temperature for 30 min. Proteolysis was then performed by mixing SARS-CoV-2 Mpro (0.8
mg/ml) with trypsin at a protease-to-protein ratio of 1:10 (w/w) in reaction buffer (25 mM Tris
8.0, 150 mM NaCl) at 37 °C for 30 min. The reaction was stopped by adding SDS sample
loading buffer and boiling at 95 °C for 10 min and subjected to SDS-PAGE (4–20%).

Isothermal titration calorimetry
The binding of TFQ to SARS-CoV-2 Mpro were conducted on an ITC-200 instrument (MicroCal,
Northampton, MA, USA) at 25 °C. SARS-CoV-2 Mpro and the inhibitors were dissolved in the
assay buffer (20 mM Tris pH 8.0, 20 mM NaCl, 0.5 % DMSO). Two microliters aliquots of TFQ
at concentration of 500 μM in the syringe were injected into the cell containing 50 μM Mpro at 3min intervals. Data were fit to a one-site binding model using the commercial Origin 7.0
program to obtain the thermodynamic parameters.

Molecular docking
Molecular docking of TFQ and HCQ to SARS-CoV-2 Mpro was performed using SwissDock and
the crystal structure of SARS-CoV-2 Mpro (PDB code: 6LU7). The docking pose with the highest
docking score for each compound was selected for further analysis. Ligand plot of each
compound was generated by PDBsum.

Virus and cell culture
SARS-CoV2 (strain NTU02, GenBank:MT066176.1) was isolated from a COVID-19 patient at
National Taiwan University Hospital and grown in Vero E6 cells. Cells were maintained in
Dulbecco’s modified Eagle’s medium (DMEM) containing 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS).

Viral infections
Vero E6 cells (1 × 107) were washed with PBS, incubated with virus diluted in serum-free
DMEM containing tosylsulfonyl phenylalanyl chloromethyl ketone (TPCK)-trypsin (2 μg/ml)
for 1 hour at 37 °C at a multiplicities of infection (MOI) of 0.001. One hour after infection, the
virus inoculum was removed. The infected cells were washed with PBS and incubated with fresh
medium containing 2% FBS.

Time course assay of TFQ
Vero E6 (7 × 104) cells were seeded in 24-well plates and subjected to two modes of drug
treatment, one in which cells were pre-treated with drugs for an hour prior to viral infection, and
the other without drug pre-treatment. Cells were then infected with virus for one hour in the
absence of drugs. After infection, cells were washed with PBS, and cultured with drugcontaining medium until the end of the experiment. The virus-containing supernatants were
harvested at one to three days post-infection and subjected to qRT-PCR to determine the viral
titers. The viral cytopathic effect (CPE) was observed under microscope and imaged at 3-day
post infection.

Viral RNA extraction and quantitative RT-PCR
The viral RNA in supernatant was extracted using the QIAamp Viral RNA Mini Kit (QIAGEN).
The extracted RNA was reverse transcribed using SuperScriptTM III reverse transcriptase
(Invitrogen). The cDNAs were amplified by real-time PCR using the LightCycler FastStart DNA
Master HybProbe (Roche Molecular Biochemicals) with a Light Cycler® 96 (Roche Molecular
Biochemicals) for 50 cycles of 10 sec at 95 °C, annealing of 10 sec at 58 °C, and elongation of
10 sec at 72 °C to detect N gene of SARS-CoV2. The following primers and probe were used:
N_Sarbeco_F1:5'-CACATTGGCACCCGCAATC-3'
N_Sarbeco_R1:5'- GAGGAACGAGAAGAGGCTTG-3'
N_Sarbeco_P1: 5'-FAM- ACTTCCTCAAGGAACAACATTGCCA -BHQ1-3'.

Statistical analysis
Data of bar or curve graphs display as percentage or number compared to control groups with a
standard deviation of two or three independent experiments. Microsoft Excel was used for
statistical analyses. The two-tailed independent Student’s t-test was used to compare continuous
variables between two groups. All experiments were carried out at least twice. The statistical
significance level of all tests is set to 0.05.

Fig. 3. Molecular docking of TFQ or HCQ to SARS-CoV-2 Mpro. Surface presentation of the
substrate-binding pocket of SARS-CoV-2 Mpro bound with TFQ (A) or HCQ (B).
Residues participated in H-bond formation are shown in red and hydrophobic interactions
in yellow. Compounds are shown with ball-and-stick model with carbon atom in green.
Detailed view of the interaction between TFQ (C) or HCQ (D) with SARS-CoV-2 Mpro.
(E) Superposition of the crystal structure of Mpro-N3 (PDB: 6LU7) with Mpro-TFQ
docked complex. N3 inhibitor is shown with ball-and-stick model with carbon atom in
magenta. The positions, P, on the peptide substrate, are named as P1, P2 (N-terminal to
the cleavage site) and P1′ (C-terminal to the cleavage site) and the corresponding binding
subsites located on the substrate-binding pocket are named as S1 (for binding to P1), S2
(binding to P2) and S1′ (for binding to P1′).

Fig. 4. TFQ represses SARS-CoV-2 infection in Vero E6 cells. (A) A schematic illustrating
two methods of treatment of Vero E6 cells infected SARS-CoV-2 with TFQ. In the pretreatment group, cells were treated TFQ for one hour prior to viral infection. (B) The
virus-infected Vero E6 cells were treated with TFQ (2.5 and 5 μM) or DMSO. The cell
supernatant was collected on day 1, day 2, and day 3 and then subjected to qRT-PCR to
determine the viral titer (n = 3). Data are shown as mean ± SD. (C) The inhibition rate of
virus infection on day 2 in Vero E6 cells treated with 2.5 μM or 5 μM TFQ with full-time
or post treatment (n = 3). Data are shown as represent mean ± SD. (D) 10× phase contrast
images of virus-infected Vero E6 treated with DMSO or TFQ (2.5 μM and 5 μM) with
TFQ full-time or post treatment.

Fig. 5. Model of TFQ-induced conformational changes in SARS-CoV-2 Mpro SARS-CoV-2
Mpro undergoes a local conformational change with increasing concentrations of TFQ (10
to 90 μM). Binding of TFQ alters nearby α-helices and to some extent reduces the
proteolytic activity of SARS-CoV-2 Mpro. At concentration above 120 μM TFQ, the
exposed hydrophobic region of SARS-CoV-2 Mpro exceed a threshold, causing protein
aggregation.
