Abstract

21
22

The severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), a β-coronavirus, is the

23

causative agent of the COVID-19 pandemic. Like for other coronaviruses, its particles are

24

composed of four structural proteins, namely Spike S, Envelope E, Membrane M and

25

Nucleoprotein N proteins. The involvement of each of these proteins and their interplays

26

during the assembly process of this new virus are poorly-defined and are likely β-

27

coronavirus-type different. Therefore, we sought to investigate how SARS-CoV-2 behaves

28

for its assembly by expression assays of S, in combination with E, M and/or N. By combining

29

biochemical and imaging assays, we showed that E and M regulate intracellular trafficking of

30

S and hence its furin-mediated processing. Indeed, our imaging data revealed that S remains

31

at ERGIC or Golgi compartments upon expression of E or M, like for SARS-CoV-2 infected

32

cells. By studying a mutant of S, we showed that its cytoplasmic tail, and more specifically,

33

its C-terminal retrieval motif, is required for the M-mediated retention in the ERGIC,

34

whereas E induces S retention by modulating the cell secretory pathway. We also

35

highlighted that E and M induce a specific maturation of S N-glycosylation, which is

36

observed on particles and lysates from infected cells independently of its mechanisms of

37

intracellular retention. Finally, we showed that both M, E and N are required for optimal

38

production of virus-like-proteins. Altogether, our results indicated that E and M proteins

39

influence the properties of S proteins to promote assembly of viral particles. Our results

40

therefore highlight both similarities and dissimilarities in these events, as compared to other

41

β-coronaviruses.

Author Summary

44
45

The severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is the causative agent of

46

the COVID-19 pandemic. Its viral particles are composed of four structural proteins, namely

47

Spike S, Envelope E, Membrane M and Nucleoprotein N proteins, though their involvement

48

in the virion assembly remain unknown for this particular coronavirus. Here we showed that

49

presence of E and M influence the localization and maturation of S protein, in term of

50

cleavage and N-glycosylation maturation. Indeed, E protein is able to slow down the cell

51

secretory pathway whereas M-induced retention of S requires the retrieval motif in S C-

52

terminus. We also highlighted that E and M might regulate the N glycosylation maturation

53

of S independently of its intracellular retention mechanism. Finally, we showed that the four

54

structural proteins are required for optimal formation of virus-like particles, highlighting the

55

involvement of N, E and M in assembly of infectious particles. Altogether, our results

56

highlight both similarities and dissimilarities in these events, as compared to other β-

57

coronaviruses.

Introduction

60
61

At the end of 2019, SARS-Cov-2 emerged in China through zoonotic transmission and led to

62

the COVID-19 pandemic, cumulating to date to over 16 million cases and more that 600,000

63

deaths worldwide [1]. SARS-CoV-2 belongs to the β-coronavirus genus of the Coronaviridae

64

family that includes SARS-CoV-1 and Middle East Respiratory Virus (MERS-CoV), which are

65

also responsible for severe lower respiratory infections.

66

The main structural components of coronaviruses are the S (Spike) glycoprotein, the M

67

(Membrane) and E (Envelope) transmembrane proteins, and the N nucleoprotein, which

68

forms a viral ribonucleoprotein (vRNPs) complex with the 30kb-long viral genomic RNA

69

(vRNA). The S glycoprotein is the major determinant of viral entry in target cells. The M

70

glycoprotein is key for assembly of viral particles by interacting with all other structural

71

proteins [2, 3], whereas the E protein is a multifunctional protein, supposed to act on viral

72

assembly, release of virions and pathogenesis (reviewed in [4]). Specifically, through its

73

oligomerization, E forms an ion-channel termed ‘viroporin’ [5, 6]. Even though M

74

coordinates virion assembly, an interaction between M and E is required for the formation

75

of viral particles [7-9].

76

Coronaviruses assembly and budding occur in the lumen of the endoplasmic reticulum (ER)-

77

Golgi intermediate compartment (ERGIC) [10, 11]. To ensure their accumulation in the

78

ERGIC, M, E and S proteins contain intracellular trafficking signals that have been identified

79

for some coronavirus species. For example, a dibasic retrieval signal, KxHxx, found at the C-

80

terminus of the cytoplasmic tail of SARS-CoV-1 Spike allows its recycling via binding to COPI

81

[12]. Such a recycling of S may increase its chance to interact with M, which resides at the

82

ERGIC, hence inducing S accumulation at the virion budding site.

83

Here, we aimed at better characterizing the interplay between S and the other structural

84

proteins E, M and N proteins of SARS-CoV-2. Owing to its homology with β-coronaviruses,

85

we hypothesized that some assembly mechanisms might be conserved between SARS-CoV-2

86

and other β-coronaviruses. Specifically, we aimed at determining how M, E and N might

87

regulate S intracellular trafficking and maturation properties. Specifically, we also

88

investigated the furin-mediated cleavage of S, which is not present in SARS-CoV-1 [13].

89

Furthermore, since SARS-CoV-1 has been proposed to induce the release of S-containing

90

virus-like particles (VLPs), though through poorly characterized processes, we also aimed at

91

clarifying the minimal requirement for production of S-containing VLPs for SARS-CoV-2.

92
93

Results

94
95

Processing of SARS-CoV-2 Spike protein is influenced by other viral proteins.

96

We compared the expression of the S glycoprotein in VeroE6 cells upon infection with full-

97

length SARS-CoV-2 vs. transfection of a S-expressing plasmid at 48h post-transfection or

98

infection (Figure 1A). We detected both a predominant non-cleaved S form, denoted S0 (of

99

ca. 180kDa,) and a cleaved form of S, denoted S2 (of around 110kDa), which is likely induced

100

from S0 processing by furin [13], an ubiquitous protein convertase localized inside the cell

101

secretory pathway [14]. We found that S2 and S0 appeared as doublets in transfected cells,

102

with less intense bands appearing above the bands that co-migrated with those detected in

103

infected cells. Interestingly, we detected ca. 10% of S2 in infected VeroE6 cells vs. up to 40%

104

in S-transfected VeroE6 cells (Figure 1A-B), suggesting that some other viral proteins may

105

influence S cleavage rates. In addition, we observed in SARS-CoV-2 infected cells a second

106

form of S2, denoted as S2*, migrating faster than S2 (around 90-100kDa), which was not

107

detected in S-transfected cells (arrow in Figure 1A), hence suggesting also that other viral

108

proteins influence the maturation of S2.

109
110

SARS-CoV-2 E and M proteins alter maturation of the S glycoprotein.

111

To determine which other viral protein could influence S processing and maturation, we co-

112

expressed S with either E, M or N structural proteins in VeroE6 cells. When we determined

113

the ratio of S0/S2 cleavage, we found a strong reduction of S0 cleavage upon S co-

114

expression with E or M, which almost prevented detection of S2 or S2* (Figure 2A). In

115

contrast, co-expression with N did not influence the processing of S. Of note, we found that

116

the cleavage rate of S was increased in 293T cells as compared to that in VeroE6 cells (Figure

117

1A, 1B), allowing to better study the influence of E, M or N structural proteins on the

118

regulation of S cleavage and maturation. Hence, we confirmed in 293T cells that co-

119

expression of S with M or E – though not with N – decreased the proportion of S cleaved

120

forms (Figure 2B, 2D). Note that the lower band of S2 (S2*) that was observed in SARS-CoV-

121

2 infected cells (Figure 1A) was detected upon co-expression of S with E or with M (Figure

122

2B), indicating that both E and M influence maturation of S2 (see below). Finally, we found

123

that the co-expression of E induced a decrease of the total amounts of S detected in lysates

124

of transfected VeroE6 and 293T cells, with a lower impact of E in 293T cells compared to

125

VeroE6 cells (Figure 2A-C), suggesting that E may promote S degradation. This hypothesis is

126

addressed in Figure 4 (see below).

127

Our above-described results upon S co-expression with E or M highlighted the presence of

128

the second form of S2, S2* (Figures 1A, 2B and quantification in Figure 2E), which migrated

129

with a higher mobility. Since the S protein is highly glycosylated [15], we thought that this

130

could reflect a change in its N-glycan maturation profile. To address this possibility, we

6

131

treated lysates of S vs. S and E, M, or N co-transfected 293T cells with PNGase F, which

132

removes all N-linked oligosaccharides from glycoproteins. After PNGase F treatment, the S2

133

and S2* bands were resolved in a single band migrating with the same mobility for all the

134

conditions (Figure 2B). This indicated that S2* is a glycosylation variant of S2 and suggested

135

that the presence of E or M alters the N-glycosylation maturation of S.

136
137

Intracellular retention of SARS-CoV-2 S is induced by M and E, and prevents syncytia

138

formation.

139

Since the E and M proteins of other coronaviruses are involved in the regulation of S

140

localization [16] and since furin is predominantly found in the late compartments of the cell

141

secretory pathway [14], we reasoned that the difference of S cleavage rates between

142

infected vs. transfected cells could be due to a difference in S intracellular localization. We

143

first investigated the cellular localization of SARS-CoV-2 S expressed alone vs. co-expressed

144

with other structural viral proteins compared to full length virus. First, we found that S

145

expressed alone in VeroE6 cells was widely distributed within the cell, including at the cell

146

surface (Figure 3A), whereas S detected in infected VeroE6 cells was mainly retained

147

intracellularly and was found to strongly colocalize with GM130 (Figure 3A, 3B), a marker of

148

the cis-Golgi but also of some compartment closed to ERGIC [17]. Second, through co-

149

transfection of VeroE6 cells, we found that SARS-CoV-2 M or E proteins co-expressed with S

150

induced its retention inside the cells as judged by its increased colocalization with GM130

151

(Figure 3A, 3B), suggesting that both M or E can alter the localization of S and prevent its

152

expression at the cell surface. Indeed, the above results were confirmed using anti-S

153

antibody staining of transfected cells without permeabilization (Supplemental Figure 1). In

154

contrast, co-expression with the N protein did not impact the subcellular localization of S

155

(Figure 3A, 3B, and Supplemental Figure 1).

156

We also found that expression of SARS-CoV-2 S alone induced the formation of syncytia in

157

transfected VeroE6 cells, resulting in the formation in multinucleated giant cells (Figure 3C).

158

This confirmed the presence of S at the cell surface and indicated that all factors required to

159

mediate cell-cell fusion events were present at the surface of these cells. In contrast, we

160

detected strongly reduced and/or much smaller syncytia when S was co-expressed with E or

161

M, whereas S fusion activity was not changed upon N expression (Figure 3C, 3D).

162

Altogether, these results indicated that M and E regulate the localization of S, probably by

163

allowing its intracellular retention within assembly sites in the ERGIC or cis-Golgi. Since the

164

ERGIC and cis-Golgi are compartments located upstream of organelles in which furin is

165

mainly localized [14], this agrees with a poorer processing and maturation of S upon its co-

166

expression with E and M.

167
168

SARS-CoV-2 E influences the level of expression of S and induces its retention via slowing

169

down the secretory pathway.

170

As noted above, our results indicated that E influences the level of expression of S (Figure

171

2A-C). We thus wondered if E could induce degradation of S via the proteasome pathway or,

172

alternatively, via lysosomal degradation. To address either possibility, we tested if either

173

MG132, a proteasome inhibitor, or Bafilomcyin A1, an inhibitor of lysosome acidification,

174

could restore the level of S expression. Intriguingly, we found that when expressed alone in

175

293T cells, S was degraded via both the proteasome and the lysosome since treatment of

176

transfected cells with either MG132 or bafilomycin A1 increased S levels by up to 4-6 folds

177

(Figure 4A, 4B). We also found that either drug only slightly increased S levels when co-

8

178

expressed with E, though to a lesser extent (up to 1.7-fold) than for S individual expression

179

(Figure 4A, 4B), suggesting that E induces the degradation of S in a proteasome- and

180

lysosome-independent manner.

181

As shown in Figure 3, co-expression of S with E induced S intracellular retention. As E of

182

some other coronaviruses is supposed to act as a viroporin [4] and as viroporins of

183

alternative unrelated viruses [18-20] have been shown to alter intracellular organelles, we

184

hypothesized that SARS-CoV-2 E could induce the retention of S by slowing down the cell

185

secretory pathway. To demonstrate this, we wondered if E could impact the secretion of

186

VSV-G tsO45 (VSV-Gts), a temperature-dependent folding mutant of VSV-G, a heterologous

187

viral glycoprotein commonly used as model cargo of protein secretion. At 40°C, this protein

188

remains unfolded, resulting in its accumulation in the ER, whereas its folding can be

189

restored at 32°C, which allows its transfer from the ER to the Golgi and then to the plasma

190

membrane.

191

We transfected Huh-7.5 cells with VSV-Gts in presence of E or of hepatitis C virus (HCV) p7

192

used as a positive control [18]. First, to address if E alters the traffic from the ER to the cis-

193

Golgi, we measured the resistance of intracellular VSV-Gts to endoH digestion [21]. While at

194

0h, all VSV-Gts glycans remained endoH-sensitive, reflecting ER retention at 40°C, they

195

progressively became resistant to endoH cleavage upon incubation at 32°C for 1h to 3h

196

(Figure 5A, 5B), underscoring VSV-Gts transfer to the Golgi apparatus. We noticed that E

197

expression induced a dose-dependent decrease of the kinetics of VSV-Gts endoH-resistance

198

acquisition (Figure 5B). We confirmed these results in transfected VeroE6 cells (Figure 5C).

199

Interestingly, these latter cells have a lower trafficking speed compared to Huh 7.5

200

(compare control conditions in Figure 5C); yet, in both cases, E was able to slow down their

201

cell secretory pathway. Next, to address the influence of E on trafficking to the plasma

9

202

membrane, we analyzed the accumulation of VSV-Gts at the cell surface after incubation of

203

transfected cells at 32°C for different times (Figure 5D). As monitored by flow cytometry

204

analysis, E expression significantly reduced the kinetics and levels of VSV-Gts cell surface

205

expression (Figure 5D, 5E).

206

Altogether, these results indicated that SARS-CoV-2 E protein slows down the cell secretory

207

pathway, hence inducing a non-specific retention of glycoproteins, which also includes S.

208
209

The C-terminal moiety of SARS-CoV-2 S cytoplasmic tail is essential for M-mediated

210

retention of S.

211

Previous studies showed that for SARS-CoV-1 S protein, a dibasic retrieval signal KxHxx

212

present at the C-terminus of its cytoplasmic tail allows the recycling of S via binding to COPI

213

[12]. Such a recycling of S increases its capacity to interact with M, which resides at the

214

virion assembly site. Owing to the conservation of this motif in the cytoplasmic of SARS-CoV-

215

2 S (Figure 6A), we thought to investigate if the involved mechanism is conserved.

216

Therefore, we tested the impact of M on retention of a mutant of SARS-CoV-2 S, named

217

SΔ19, from which the last 19 amino acids, including the dibasic retrieval signal, were

218

removed (Figure 6A). In contrast to wt S, we found that SΔ19, when co-expressed with M in

219

VeroE6 cells, exhibited impaired intracellular retention (compare Figure 6B with Figure 3B,

220

and Supplemental Figure 1), which confirmed that this retrieval signal allows S recycling and

221

consequently, M-mediated retention of S. Interestingly, co-expression of E still induced the

222

retention of SΔ19 (Figure 6B), which agreed with our above results that E can induce the

223

retention of S by modulating intracellular trafficking (Figures 3 and 5) rather than by

224

interacting directly with S. Of note, we observed that despite the presence of E, SΔ19 did

225

not colocalize with GM130 to the same extent than for S (compare M1 coefficients in Figure
10

bioRxiv preprint doi: https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.08.24.260901; this version posted August 24, 2020. The copyright holder for this preprint

226

6B vs. Figure 3B), suggesting that E induces the retention of SΔ19 inside the cells though,

227

due to the lack of retrieval signal, SΔ19 does not accumulate in GM130-containing

228

compartments.

229

To confirm the correlation between the lack of retention and processing of S, we

230

determined the cleavage rate of S∆19 in cells co-transfected with E or M. S∆19 co-expressed

231

with E exhibited reduced cleavage rate whereas co-expression of M did not alter this rate

232

(Figure 6C, 6D). This confirmed that the M-mediated retention of S and its reduced cleavage

233

rate is dependent on the C-terminal retention motif whereas E-mediated retention of S and

234

its reduced cleavage rate is linked to modification of the cell secretory pathway.

235

To corroborate these results, we determined the fusion index of cells expressing SΔ19 alone

236

or SΔ19 in combination with the other viral structural proteins. Interestingly, we found that

237

SΔ19 was highly fusogenic and induced much larger syncytia than wt S (Figure 3D vs. Figure

238

6F), likely because of its accumulation at the cell surface owing to deletion of the recycling

239

signal. In agreement with our previous observations that M, but not E, does not alter SΔ19

240

processing (Figure 6C, 6D), co-expression of SΔ19 and M did not change the fusion index

241

whereas co-expression of SΔ19 and E almost suppressed the formation of syncytia (Figure

242

6F).

243

Interestingly, we detected the presence of both S2 and S2* for SΔ19 co-expressed with E or

244

M (Figure 6C), which was resolved to a single S2 band upon treatment with PNGase F

245

(Figure 6E), thus confirming that, for both wt S and SΔ19, the presence of S2* was due to

246

modification of N-glycan maturation. Since M is not able to induce retention of SΔ19, this

247

argues for a modification of N glycosylation pathway by E and M independently of the

248

retention of S.

249

Altogether, these results indicated that M and E induce the retention of S via different

250

mechanisms. Indeed, the cytoplasmic tail of S may be involved in its weak retrieval by

251

allowing interaction with COPI, and thus a subsequent interaction with M, whereas E may

252

induce the retention of S by regulating intracellular trafficking.

253
254

Secretion of S-displaying VLPs requires co-expression of both E, M and N.

255

Previous reports indicated that for alternative coronaviruses, the intracellular retention of S

256

by M is essential for assembly of infectious particles and that the presence of E is essential

257

for budding of particles. We sought to extend this notion by investigating the mechanism of

258

assembly of SARS-CoV-2 VLPs, which appears poorly defined. Since we showed that M and E

259

are involved in the regulation of S localization and trafficking (Figure 3), we hypothesized

260

that either protein could be required for production of VLPs. Thus, we transfected 293T cells

261

with plasmids inducing expression of S alone vs. of S in combination with E, M, and/or N or

262

with all proteins altogether. At 48h post-transfection, we collected the cell supernatants and

263

we purified particles by ultracentrifugation through a sucrose cushion. As shown in Figure

264

7A-C, we found that S expressed alone, i.e., raising S0 and S2 bands, was poorly detected in

265

the pellets of ultracentrifugation. Co-expression of N, M or E alone with S did not improve

266

the secretion of S. Co-expression of S with both E and N or with both M and N could slightly

267

increase the presence of S in the pellets (Figure 7A, 7B), though this correlated to an

268

increased expression level in cell lysates (Figure 7C). In contrast, we found that co-

269

expression of the combination of M, N and E with S induced a strong production of VLPs

270

with a high detection of S in the pellet and low detection in the cell lysate, suggesting that

271

all structural proteins are required for optimal secretion of S-containing VLPs (Figure 7A-C).

272

We also found that N expressed with S was poorly secreted, whereas its secretion was

readily increased upon co-expression with S, M and E (Figure 7A), hence suggesting a

274

concerted action of N, M and E for budding and secretion of S-containing VLPs.

275

Similar to our observations in lysates of co-transfected cells (Figure 1), we found that the

276

S2* form was detected in the pellets of purified particles produced upon S co-expression

277

with E or M, as compared to those produced with S alone or with S and N (Figure 7A), in

278

agreement with a different maturation pathway when E or M are present, as above-

279

proposed.

280

Finally, we confirmed that expression of S, E, M and N in VeroE6 cells allowed the secretion

281

of VLPs (Figure 7D). We observed the presence of S in the pellets of supernatants of either

282

infected cells or cells transfected with S, E, M and N. Note that we confirmed the presence

283

of the S2* form in the latter pellets.

284

Altogether, these results showed that E, M, and N are required for the optimal production

285

of VLPs containing S.

Discussion

289
290

Here, we highlight that SARS-CoV-2 E and M proteins induce the retention of S inside the

291

cells, which probably provides a mechanism allowing the targeting of S close to the virion

292

assembly site. In addition, we also show that independently of their effect on retention of S,

293

E and M co-expression alter the maturation of the N glycans of S (Figure 8). Finally, we

294

found that E, M and N are the optimal set of proteins required to for secretion S-harboring

295

virus-like particles.

297

SARS-CoV-2 E slows down the cell secretory pathway.

298

We showed that E induce the retention of S by modulating the cell secretory pathway

299

(Figure 5). Interestingly, E from other β -coronaviruses, and especially SARS-CoV-1, were

300

shown to form cation-selective ion channels [22, 23]. We and others previously

301

demonstrated that viroporins of unrelated viruses are able to slow down the cell secretory

302

pathway, like for HCV p7 [18] or Influenza A virus M2 [19, 20], prompting us to investigate if

303

SARS-CoV-2 E could alter the cell secretory pathway. In addition, as it was shown that

304

Coronavirus Infectious Bronchitis Virus (IBV) E is able to alter the secretory pathway [24], we

305

therefore speculate that SARS-CoV2 E could alter the cell secretory pathway via a

306

mechanism shared with some other coronaviruses. Interestingly, we also found that the

307

retention of S induced by E is independent of the retrieval signal of S (Figure 6), although

308

this retrieval signal modulates S localization even in presence of E. Indeed, in presence of E,

309

a mutant of S deleted for this signal did not accumulate in GM130-containing compartment

310

in contrast to wt S.

311

We propose that the modulation of the cell secretory pathway could be important for

312

assembly of infectious particles by allowing the accumulation of the viral structural

313

components at the virion assembly site. Alternatively, the modulation of cell secretory

314

pathway per se could be independent of the assembly of infectious viral particles, but rather

315

linked to virulence and/or induction of inflammasome since E was found to be associated to

316

virulence of several coronavirus genera, like e.g., for SARS-CoV-1 [25, 26] or IBV [24] as well

317

as induction of inflammasome for SARS-CoV-1[27] .

318
319

SARS-CoV-2 E influence the level of expression of S.

320

We found that expression of E decreased the level of expression of S (Figure 2). One

321

possibility is that E could induce a degradation of S via either the proteasome or the

322

lysosome pathways. However, inhibition of the latter pathways did not restore the level of S

323

expression in presence of E, hence suggesting that E does not act on the degradation of S

324

per se but rather, could alter S synthesis and/or modify the level of secretion of S. Yet, we

325

ruled out the latter hypothesis since we did not observe an increase of secretion of S in

326

presence of E (Figure 7), hence, inferring that E may regulate the synthesis of S. Indeed, E

327

may induce cellular stress via its ion channel activity, as proposed for some other viroporins

328

[28], which may thus influence the level of translation by cellular stress responses [29]. In

329

line with this hypothesis, individual expression of E from SARS-CoV-1 [30] as well from the

330

murine coronovirus MHV (mouse hepatitis virus) [31] could induce apoptosis. However, we

331

cannot rule out that the effect observed here for E of SARS-CoV2 could be due to the

332

overexpression of E alone, as compared to the expression E in the context of infection, since

333

the expression of other viral proteins could compensate the effect of E.

334
335

Expression of SARS-CoV-2 E and M modulate the N-glycosylation pathway.

336

We found that E and M regulate the maturation of N glycosylation of S (Figure 2); yet, we

337

showed that this is not related to the role of the former proteins in the retention of S at the

338

Golgi, as assessed by using the SΔ19 mutant that retained the same maturation as wt S

339

despite its lack of intracellular retention (Figure 6). Rather, this suggested that the

340

modification of N-glycosylation is not linked to glycoprotein retrieval in an intracellular

341

compartment lacking the glycosyltransferases. Previous reports have shown that, for other

342

coronaviruses, E and M are located at the ERGIC and/or Golgi membranes [32-35]. Although

343

we could not confirm this for SARS-CoV-2 E and M, owing to the unavailability of specific

15

344

antibodies, we speculate that they share the same intracellular localization. Since the

345

maturation of N-glycosylation occurs in the Golgi, one possibility is that accumulation of E

346

and M proteins at the membrane of this organelle could induce changes that alter the

347

correct action of glycosyltransferases [36].

348
349

All structural proteins are required for optimal production of SARS-CoV-2 VLPs.

350

While S expressed alone did not induce the secretion of S-containing VLPs, we found that

351

combining its expression with some of the other structural proteins resulted in the

352

formation of such particles, although co-expression of all structural proteins was the most

353

efficient combination to induce VLP secretion (Figure 7). Indeed, when all these proteins

354

were expressed, the cells were almost depleted in S whereas S was readily found in the

355

pellets of their ultracentrifugated supernatants (Figure 7A). While M is essential for the

356

assembly of virions, previous results of others showed that for alternative coronaviruses, S

357

is dispensable for promoting virion assembly although it is readily incorporated in viral

358

particles upon co-expression with other structural proteins [16]. Thus, we could speculate

359

that SARS-CoV-2 has adopted a similar mechanism. However, the involvement of E and N in

360

virion assembly might be coronavirus strain-dependent [16]. For SARS-CoV-1, the

361

mechanism of formation of VLPs remains unclear since co-expression of M and E [37], of M

362

and N [8], or of M, N and E [38] proteins resulted in the production of VLPs, although these

363

previous studies did not focus on S-containing VLPs. Our results underscore that for SARS-

364

CoV-2, S co-expression with either E, M, or N structural proteins induces low level secretion

365

of S containing-VLPs. We also tested all combination of the three structural proteins E, M

366

and N co-expressed with S. While all conditions allowed secretion of S containing-VLPs, we

367

found that the optimal VLP production required both M, N and E co-expression.

368

Previous results indicated that for most coronaviruses, E is essential for incorporation of M

369

in viral particles, inferring a conserved mechanism for SARS-CoV-2. First, E and M are known

370

to interact with each other [33]. In addition, E might be involved in inducing membrane

371

curvature or scission of vesicles [39, 40]. The role of N is more complex and remains poorly

372

defined. N is able to form high-order oligomers [41, 42] even in absence of RNA [43] that

373

may stabilize the particles and or the oligomerization of M. In addition, we showed that N

374

can be secreted in presence of S independently of E and M expression, suggesting that N, at

375

least in presence of S, may help virion budding via a “push” mechanism [44]. Indeed, the

376

driving force for budding of enveloped viruses can be driven by the nucleocapsid itself that

377

“pushes” a membranous bud, via specific inner structural proteins (e.g., Gag precursor of

378

HIV), or alternatively, by the envelope glycoproteins that can form a symmetric lattice

379

“pulling” the membrane (e.g., prME of flaviviruses), even if viruses have evolved and

380

developed different mechanisms with some variations or combinations between these two

381

main models [44]. In line with this, we could imagine that for SARS-CoV-2, the optimal

382

driving force for budding could be due to N that could push the membrane as well as to E

383

and M that could create optimal curvature and pull the membrane, hence allowing efficient

384

budding of viral particles.

385
386

Altogether, the results of this report indicated that E and M proteins differentially influence

387

the properties of S proteins to promote assembly of SARS-CoV-2VLPs. Our results therefore

388

highlight both similarities and dissimilarities in these events, as compared to other β-

389

coronaviruses. Owing to their lack of infectivity, such VLPs could provide attractive tools for

390

studying vaccines or immune responses against COVID-19.

816

Due to its weak retention signal located at the C-terminus of its cytoplasmic tail, S is found

817

at the cell surface but also inside the cells. In contrast, removal of the last 19 amino acids

818

(SΔ19) increases the presence of S at the cell surface. Co-expression of E induces the

819

retention of both wt S and SΔ19. In contrast, co-expression of M induces the retention of wt

820

S only. Irrespective of S forms, the presence of E and M modulate the maturation of N-

821

glycans of S.
