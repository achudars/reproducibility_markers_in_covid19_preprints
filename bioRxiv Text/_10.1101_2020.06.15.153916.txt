ABSTRACT

2

The outbreak of the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2

3

(SARS-CoV-2) poses a huge threat to many countries around the world. However,

4

where is it origin and which animals are sensitive to cross-species transmission is

5

unclear. The interaction of virus and cell receptor is a key determinant of host range

6

for the novel coronavirus. Angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) is demonstrated

7

as the primary entry receptor for SARS-CoV-2. In this study, we evaluated the

8

SARS-CoV-2 entry mediated by ACE2 of 11 different species of animals, and

9

discovered that ACE2 of Rhinolophus sinicus (Chinese horseshoe bat), Felis catus

10

(domestic cat), Canis lupus familiaris (dog), Sus scrofa (pig), Capra hircus (goat) and

11

especially Manis javanica (Malayan pangolin) were able to render SARS-CoV-2 entry

12

in non-susceptible cells. This is the first report that ACE2 of Pangolin could mediate

13

SARS-CoV-2 entry which increases the presume that SARS-CoV-2 may have a

14

pangolin origin. However, none of the ACE2 proteins from Rhinolophus

15

ferrumequinum (greater horseshoe bat), Gallus gallus (chicken), Notechis scutatus

16

(mainland tiger snake), Mus musculus (house mouse) rendered SARS-CoV-2 entry.

17

Specifically, a natural isoform of Macaca mulatta (Rhesus monkey) ACE2 with a

18

mutation of Y217N was resistance to infection, which rises the possible impact of this

19

type of ACE2 during monkey studies of SARS-CoV-2. Overall, these results clarify

20

that SARS-CoV-2 could engage receptors of multiple species of animals and it is a

21

perplexed work to track SARS-CoV-2 origin and its intermediate hosts.

IMPORTANCE

2

In this study, we illustrated that SARS-CoV-2 is able to engage receptors of

3

multiple species of animals. This indicated that it may be a perplexed work to track

4

SARS-CoV-2 origin and discover its intermediate hosts. This feature of virus is

5

considered to potentiate its diverse cross-species transmissibility. Of note, here is the

6

first report that ACE2 of Pangolin could mediate SARS-CoV-2 entry which increases

7

the possibility that SARS-CoV-2 may have a pangolin origin. And we also

8

demonstrated that not all species of bat were sensitive to SARS-CoV-2 infection. At

9

last, it is also important to detect the expression ratio of the Y217N ACE2 to the

10

prototype in Rhesus monkeys to be recruited for studies on SARS-CoV-2 infection.

INTRODUCTION

2

In December 2019, a novel pneumonia, termed as COVID-19 by World Health

3

Organization (WHO) thereafter, emerged in Wuhan, China, and the causative agent

4

was soon identified as a novel coronavirus, which is termed as severe acute

5

respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) by the International Committee

6

on Taxonomy of Viruses, ICTV (1, 2). The SARS-CoV-2 outbreak has been

7

speculatively associated with a seafood market where sales also various land wild

8

animals (3). Bats are recognized as a potential natural reservoir for SARS-CoV-2 (1,

9

3). However, recently studies indicated that pangolins were also considered as

10

possible natural hosts of this coronavirus (4, 5). Discovering the potential

11

intermediate animal hosts of SARS-CoV-2 and evaluating their possible cross-species

12

transmissibility will be scientifically very important. Unfortunately, we know little

13

about this. Currently, there are no suitable animal models for SARS-CoV-2 infection.

14

A recent study revealed that ferrets and cats were sensitive to SARS-CoV-2 infection,

15

however, these animals showed no clinical symptoms (6). Whether there exist other

16

animal(s) as a candidate SARS-CoV-2 infection model should be further explored.

17

The interaction between receptor and virus is a key determinant of the host range.

18

It has been demonstrated that SARS-CoV-2 resembles SARS-CoV, which uses

19

angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) as the primary cell entry receptor (1, 7-9).

20

When we retrace the origin of coronavirus, the cell susceptibility to viruses conferred

21

by receptors of speculated animals is a preferential consideration (10, 11). Before

22

clarifying that Rhinolophus sinicus is the natural reservoir of SARS-CoV, scientists

first evaluated the susceptibility provided by ACE2 from different bat species to

2

SARS-CoV. They found that the ACE2 of Rhinolophus sinicus was responsible for the

3

susceptibility to SARS-CoV and subsequently confirmed that Rhinolophus sinicus

4

was the natural reservoir of SARS-CoV (10, 12, 13). The Middle East respiratory

5

syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) was also recognized has a bat origin due to that

6

both the MERS-CoV and two MERS-CoV-related viruses from bats could utilize

7

human or bat dipeptidyl peptidase 4 (DPP4) for cell entry (14-16).

8

Therefore, in this study, we systemically evaluated the ability of SARS-CoV-2 to

9

infect two types of non-susceptible cells utilizing ACE2 proteins from nine different

10

species of animals and the human being to determine its possible origin and further to

11

explore its potentiate cross-species transmission. Our findings provide evidence that

12

SARS-CoV-2 was able to engage broad receptors of different species, which poses a

13

huge challenge to search the animal origin of SARS-CoV-2 for the control and

14

prevention in future.

15

RESULT

16

To investigate which animalâ€™s ACE2 could render SARS-CoV-2 entry, we

17

synthesized the full-length cDNA fragments of ACE2 from 11 species of animals, as

18

well as the human being. These species were Rhinolophus sinicus (Chinese horseshoe

19

bat), Rhinolophus ferrumequinum (greater horseshoe bat), Felis catus (domestic cat),

20

Capra hircus (goat), Canis lupus familiaris (dog), Sus scrofa (pig), Manis javanica

21

(Malayan pangolin), Gallus gallus (chicken), Notechis scutatus (mainland tiger snake),

sapiens (human). Synthesized DNA fragments were then sub-cloned into the

2

pCAGGS-HA vector for the expression in eukaryotic cells. The origins and GenBank

3

accession numbers of these ACE2 molecules were listed in the Table. We firstly

4

compared the nucleotide sequences of ACE2 coding regions of these animals to that

5

of human. The sequence similarities of these ACE2 cDNAs were exhibited in the

6

Table. Among these sequences, the ACE2 of Rhesus monkey was most close to

7

human, and in contrast, the ACE2 of snake was the farthest. It has been reported that

8

two virus-binding hotspots, Lys31 and Lys353 in hACE2, were critical for

9

SARS-CoV infection (17, 18). In this study, we found that the Lys31 was not

10

conserved in ACE2 of all the 11 animal species observed in this study. However, the

11

Lys353 was conserved in all the 10 animal species except mouse (Table).

12

Next, we tested whether ACE2 of the nine animal species were able to render

13

SARS-CoV-2 entry to non-susceptible HEK293T cell lines. Different ACE2s could be

14

expressed and presented in the surface of HEK293T cells by IFA (Figure 1).

15

HEK293T Plasmids expressing ACE2 of human and mice were applied as the positive

16

and negative control of the entry assay, respectively. No attempt was made to quantify

17

infection efficiency in this study due to difficulties encountered in conducting

18

experiments under BSL-3 conditions. As expected, the human ACE2 supported

19

SARS-CoV-2 entry whereas mouse ACE2 did not (Figure 1). One previous study

20

indicated that the SARS-CoV outbreak in 17 years ago was originated from

21

Rhinolophus affinis (Intermediate horseshoe bat) (12). A recent study further

22

demonstrated that ACE2 of Rhinolophus sinicus (Chinese horseshoe bat) also

rendered SARS-CoV-2 entry besides SARS-CoV (1). In this study, we was not able to

2

synthesize the ACE2 cDNA of Rhinolophus affinis due to the absent of its sequence.

3

Therefore, we synthesized the ACE2 cDNA of Rhinolophus sinicus and Rhinolophus

4

ferrumequinum (Greater horseshoe bat) to test whether ACE2 of other bat species was

5

responsible for the susceptibility to SARS-CoV-2. Interestingly, we found that the

6

ACE2 of Rhinolophus ferrumequinum did not support the SARS-CoV-2 entry as

7

Rhinolophus sinicus (Figure 2), suggesting that not all species of bat were sensitive to

8

SARS-CoV-2 infection.

9

A recent study indicated that SARS-CoV-2 did not replicate and shed in dogs,

10

pigs, chickens and ducks, but fairly good in ferrets and effectively in cats (6).

11

Consistently, our study demonstrated that the cat ACE2 supported viral entry (Figure

12

1). Although pigs, dogs and chickens were non-sensitive to SARS-CoV-2 infection,

13

we know little about its molecular mechanisms and the role of receptor avidity for the

14

resistance. Our data demonstrated that ACE2 proteins of dog and pig supported

15

SARS-CoV-2 entry as that of cat.

16

Old world monkeys (Macaca mulatta and Macaca fascicularis) were used as

17

animal models of experimental SARS-CoV-2 infection (19). Surprisingly, we found

18

that the ACE2 of Macaca mulatta in our study did not support the SARS-CoV-2 entry

19

as expected (Figure 1). By investigating the monkey ACE2 sequence, we found that

20

an ACE2 isoform of Macaca mulatta, which contained two natural variations (R192G

21

and Y217N) comparing with the wild type ACE2, was cloned (Figure 2A). Our data

22

revealed that the ACE2 of Macaca mulatta with the Y217N mutation also fault to

support SARS-CoV-2 infection. When we restored Y217N mutation as wild type

2

ACE2 of Macaca mulatta, N217Y recovery the ability to support SARS-CoV-2

3

infection (Figure 2B). We noticed that the prototype 217Y was conserved in other

4

species of animals investigated in this study excluding Macaca mulatta (data not

5

shown), which suggests that the 217 position is a key residual for SARS-CoV-2

6

infection.

7

There is a dispute on if SARS-CoV-2 originated from bats or pangolins (1, 4, 5).

8

It has been demonstrated that a bat ACE2 mediated the SARS-CoV-2 entry (1).

9

However, whether ACE2 of pangolins support the virus entry was unclear. Therefore,

10

we expressed the ACE2 of Malayan pangolins (Manis javanica) and tested its role in

11

conferring the susceptibility to SARS-CoV-2. For the first time, we demonstrated that

12

SARS-CoV-2 could engaged the ACE2 of pangolins to entry (Figure 1).

13

At last, we demonstrated ACE2 of Notechis scutatus (mainland tiger snake) could

14

not support SARS-CoV-2 entry as previously predicted (20). And snakes may be not

15

the source of SARS-CoV-2.

16

DISSCUSSION

17

Spike features of coronaviruses and lysosomal proteases of hosts determine the

18

tropism of coronavirus (21). A bat coronavirus RaTG13 in Rhinolophus affinis

19

(Intermediate horseshoe bat) from Yunnan exhibits the highest sequence similarity to

20

SARS-CoV-2 until now (1). In this study, we found that the ACE2 of Rhinolophus

21

ferrumequinum (Greater horseshoe bat) failed to mediate SARS-CoV-2 entry, whereas

22

ACE2 of Rhinolophus sinicus (Chinese horseshoe bat) rendered SARS-CoV-2 entry to

1

non-susceptible cells. In fact, in contrast to the genetically homogenous human ACE2,

2

bat ACE2 proteins have great genetic diversity (13). A number of ACE2 molecules

3

isolated from different bat species failed to mediate efficient SARS-CoV entry (13). A

4

study has reported that Rhinolophus sinicus serves as natural reservoirs of SARS-CoV

5

and an isolated bat-origin SARS-CoV-like virus is able to employ ACE2 proteins

6

from humans and civets for cell entry (12). These results suggest that analysis of the

7

receptor-conferred susceptibility to the virus entry is important before investigating

8

for the bat-origin of SARS-CoV-2.

9

Recently, pangolins are also considered as a possible natural host of SARS-CoV-2

10

(4, 5). Coronaviruses with high sequence homology were identified in Malayan

11

pangolins (Manis javanica) suggesting to be a possible source for the emergence of

12

SARS-CoV-2 (4). We demonstrated that the ACE2 of Malayan pangolin supported

13

SARS-CoV-2 entry in non-susceptible cells (Figure 1). SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV

14

engage receptors of both human and the natural animal hosts (12, 16). Similarly, the

15

ability of pangolin ACE2 to confer the susceptibility to SARS-CoV-2 entry increases

16

the possibility that SARS-CoV-2 originated from pangolins.

17

In this study, we demonstrated that ACE2 of pig and dog rendered SARS-CoV-2

18

entry. However, a recent study reported that SARS-CoV-2 replicated poorly in dogs

19

and pigs (6). We speculate that there exist other factors determining the host tropism

20

besides receptor interaction. A recent study demonstrated that pigs and dogs exhibit

21

relatively low levels of ACE2 in the respiratory tract, this may be the reason that

22

SARS-CoV-2 replicated poorly in dogs and pigs (22). Although dogs and pigs may

1

not sensitive for SARS-CoV-2 infection, we do not know whether these animals are

2

appeared as asymptomatic carriers of SARS-CoV-2 in certain environments. In

3

humans asymptomatically infected with SARS-CoV-2, the viral loads were reported

4

similar to that in the symptomatic patients, which implicates the similar risk of viral

5

transmission from asymptomatic carriers (23, 24).

6

Based on structure analysis of human ACE2 and spikes of SARS-CoV-2, the

7

receptor binding domain (RBD) of the spike takes a more compact conformation than

8

SARS-CoV, implicating a relation to the higher transmission of SARS-CoV-2 than

9

SARS-CoV (25, 26). However, in mouse ACE2, the Lys at site 353 is substituted by

10

His, which does not fit into the virus-receptor binding interface as tightly as the lysine

11

at the same site of human ACE2. Consequently, this may result in the failure of mice

12

ACE2 confer the susceptibility to SARS-CoV-2 entry. A recent publication also

13

demonstrated that the substitution of Lys353 of human ACE2 (hACE2) by Ala was

14

sufficient to abolish the interaction between hACE2 and the S protein of SARS-CoV-2

15

(27). In addition, although the residue at site 217 of ACE2 is not directly contact to

16

the RBD, this site in Rhesus monkey ACE2 is still critical for SARS-CoV-2 entry. It

17

was observed that the natural variation of Y217N at this site of the monkey ACE-2

18

significantly reduced the susceptibility to SARS-CoV entry, which demonstrated that

19

this residual variation is responsible for the down regulation of ACE2 expression (28).

20

However, our results showed that this Y217N-isoform of ACE2 expressed at a similar

21

level as the human ACE2 in transfected cells (data not shown). Therefore, the failure

22

of monkey ACE2 isoform to convert the cell susceptibility to SARS-CoV-2 entry is

detailed mechanism needs further investigation. It is also important to detect the

expression ratio of the Y217N ACE2 to the prototype in Rhesus monkeys to be

recruited for studies on SARS-CoV-2 infection.
