36

Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) has infected 78 million

37

individuals and is responsible for over 1.7 million deaths to date. Infection is associated

38

with development of variable levels of antibodies with neutralizing activity that can protect

39

against infection in animal models. Antibody levels decrease with time, but the nature and

40

quality of the memory B cells that would be called upon to produce antibodies upon re-

41

infection has not been examined. Here we report on the humoral memory response in a

42

cohort of 87 individuals assessed at 1.3 and 6.2 months after infection. We find that IgM,

43

and IgG anti-SARS-CoV-2 spike protein receptor binding domain (RBD) antibody titers

44

decrease significantly with IgA being less affected. Concurrently, neutralizing activity in

45

plasma decreases by five-fold in pseudotype virus assays. In contrast, the number of RBD-

46

specific memory B cells is unchanged. Memory B cells display clonal turnover after 6.2

47

months, and the antibodies they express have greater somatic hypermutation, increased

48

potency and resistance to RBD mutations, indicative of continued evolution of the humoral

49

response. Analysis of intestinal biopsies obtained from asymptomatic individuals 4 months

50

after coronavirus disease-2019 (COVID-19) onset, using immunofluorescence, or

51

polymerase chain reaction, revealed persistence of SARS-CoV-2 nucleic acids and

52

immunoreactivity in the small bowel of 7 out of 14 volunteers. We conclude that the

53

memory B cell response to SARS-CoV-2 evolves between 1.3 and 6.2 months after infection

54

in a manner that is consistent with antigen persistence.

56

Antibody responses to SARS-CoV-2 were initially characterized in a cohort of COVID-19-

57

convalescent individuals approximately 40 days (1.3 months) after infection 1. Between 31

58

August and 16 October 2020, 100 participants returned for a 6-month follow-up study visit.

59

Although initial criteria allowed enrollment of close contacts of individuals diagnosed with

60

reverse transcription (RT–PCR) confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection 1, 13 of the contacts did not

61

seroconvert and were excluded from further analyses. The remaining 87 participants with RT-

62

PCR–confirmed COVID-19 diagnosis and/or seroconversion returned for analysis approximately

63

191 days (6.2 months, range: 165-223 days) after the onset of symptoms. In this cohort,

64

symptoms lasted for a median of 12 days (0–44 days) during the acute phase, and 10 (11%) of

65

the participants were hospitalized. Consistent with other reports 2,3, 38 (44%) of the participants

66

reported persistent long-term symptoms attributable to COVID-19 (Methods and Supplementary

67

Tables 1 and 2). The duration and severity of symptoms during acute disease was significantly

68

greater among participants with persistent post-acute symptoms at the second study visit

69

(Extended Data Fig. 1m-q). Importantly, all 87 participants tested negative for SARS-CoV-2 at

70

the 6-month follow-up study visit using an approved saliva-based PCR assay (Methods).

71

Participant demographics and clinical characteristics are shown in Supplementary Tables 1,2.

72
73

Antibody reactivity in plasma to RBD and nucleoprotein (N) was measured by enzyme-linked

74

immunosorbent assay (ELISA) and automated serological assays

75

strongly correlated (ELISA anti-RBD IgG and IgM/Pylon-IgG and IgM at 1.3 months, r=0.9200

76

and r=0.7543, p < 0.0001, respectively. Extended Data Fig 2a-d) while anti-N assays showed a

77

moderate correlation (anti-N IgG ELISA and Roche anti-N total Ig at 1.3 months, r=0.3596, p =

78

0.0012. Extended Data Fig 2e-f). The anti-RBD and ELISA anti-N antibodies in plasma

79

decreased significantly between 1.3 and 6.2 months (Fig. 1a-d). Notably, the decreased binding

80

activity differed significantly by isotype and target. IgM showed the greatest decrease in anti-

81

RBD reactivity (53%), followed by IgG (32%) while anti-RBD IgA decreased by only 15% and

82

anti-N IgG levels by 22% (Fig. 1e). In contrast, the Roche anti-N assay5 showed a small but

83

significant increase (19%) in reactivity between the two time points (Extended Data Fig 2g)

84

which might be explained by the use of an antigen bridging approach6. In all cases the magnitude

85

of the decrease was inversely proportional to and directly correlated with the initial antibody

86

levels such that individuals with higher initial levels showed greater relative changes (Fig. 1f-i,

87

Extended Data Fig 2h). All measurements were strongly correlated between the two time points

88

(Extended Data Fig 2i-m) and anti-N IgG correlated with IgM, IgG and IgA anti-RBD reactivity

89

at 1.3 months, respectively (Extended Data Fig. 2n-p). Notably, individuals with persistent post-

90

acute symptoms had significantly higher anti-RBD IgG and anti-N total antibody levels at both

91

study visits (Extended Data Fig. 1a-l).

92
93

Plasma neutralizing activity was measured using an HIV-1 virus pseudotyped with the SARS-

94

CoV-2 spike protein1,7. Consistent with other reports the geometric mean half-maximal

95

neutralizing titer (NT50) in this group of 87 participants was 401 and 78 at 1.3 and 6.2 months,

96

respectively, representing a five-fold decrease (Fig. 1j-k)8,9. Neutralizing activity was directly

97

correlated with the IgG anti-RBD ELISA measurements (Extended data Fig. 2q-r). Moreover,

98

the absolute magnitude of the decrease in neutralizing activity was inversely proportional to and

99

directly correlated with the neutralizing activity at the earlier time point (Fig. 1l). We conclude

100

that antibodies to RBD and plasma neutralizing activity decrease significantly but remain

101

detectable 6 months after infection with SARS-CoV-2 in the majority of individuals.

102
103

To examine the phenotypic landscape of circulating B cells we performed high-dimensional flow

104

cytometry on 41 randomly selected individuals at both time points and compared to pre-COVID-

105

19 samples from healthy individuals (n=20). Global high-dimensional mapping with t-distributed

106

stochastic neighbor embedding (tSNE) revealed significant persistent alterations in SARS-CoV-2

107

recovered individuals (Extended data Fig. 3a). The relative representation of clusters 2, 7, 8, 10

108

corresponding to naïve, memory, plasmablasts and plasma cells was decreased at 1.3 months and

109

remained so at the later time point. Metacluster 15, which corresponds to immature B cells that

110

are recent bone marrow immigrants was increased at the early time point but returned to control

111

levels at the end of the observation period (Extended data Fig. 3b-d).

112
113

Whereas plasma cells are the source of circulating antibodies, memory B cells contribute to

114

recall responses. To identify and enumerate the circulating SARS-CoV-2 memory B cell

115

compartment we used flow cytometry to isolate individual B lymphocytes with receptors that

116

bound to RBD

117

memory B cells increased marginally between 1.3 and 6.2 months in 21 randomly selected

118

individuals (Fig. 2b).

119
120

To determine whether there were changes in the antibodies produced by memory B cells after 6.2

121

months, we obtained 532 paired antibody heavy and light chains from the same 6 individuals that

122

were examined at the earlier time point1 (Supplementary Table 3). There was no significant

123

difference in IGV gene representation at the two time points, including the over-representation of

124

the IGHV3-30 and 3-53 gene segments

1,10-15

(Extended data Fig. 5a-b). In keeping with this

125

observation, and similar to the earlier time point, antibodies that shared the same IGHV and

126

IGLV genes comprised 8.6% of all sequences in different individuals (Extended data Fig. 5c). As

127

might be expected, there was a small but significant overall increase in the percentage of IgG-

128

expressing anti-RBD memory cells, from 49% to 58% (p=0.011, Extended data Fig. 5d-f).

129

Consistent with the fractional increase in IgG memory cells, the extent of somatic hypermutation

130

for both IGH and IGL differed significantly in all 6 individuals between the two time points.

131

Whereas the average number of nucleotide mutations in IGH and IGL was only 4.2 and 2.8 at the

132

first time point, these values were increased to 11.7 and 6.5 at the second time point (p<0.0001,

133

Fig. 2c and Extended data Fig. 6a-f). In contrast, the overall average IGH and IGL CDR3 length

134

and hydrophobicity were unchanged (Extended data Fig. 6g-h).

135
136

Similar to the earlier time point, we found expanded clones of memory B cells at 6.2 months

137

including 23 that appeared at both time points. However, expanded clones accounted for only

138

12.4% of all antibody sequences after 6.2 months compared to 32% after 1.3 months (p = 0.0225,

139

Fig. 2d-e). In addition, the overall clonal composition of the memory compartment differed at the

140

two time points in all individuals examined (Fig. 2d). Forty-three expanded clones that were

141

present at the earlier time point were not detectable after 6.2 months while 22 new expanded

142

clones appeared. In addition, the relative distribution of clones that appeared at both time points

143

also varied. For example, the dominant clones in COV21 and COV57 representing 9.0% and

144

16.7% of all sequences, respectively, were reduced to 1.1% and 1.9% of all sequences after 6.2

145

months (Fig. 2d and Supplementary Table 3). We conclude that while the magnitude of the

146

RBD-specific memory B cell compartment is conserved between 1.3 and 6.2 months after

147

SARS-CoV-2 infection, there is significant clonal turnover and antibody sequence evolution,

148

consistent with prolonged germinal center reactions.

149
150

One hundred and twenty-two representative antibodies from the 6.2-month time point were

151

tested for reactivity to RBD (Supplementary Table 4). The antibodies that were evaluated

152

included: (1) 49 that were randomly selected from those that appeared only once; (2) 23 that

153

appeared as singles at both 1.3 and 6.2 months; (3) 23 representatives of newly appearing

154

expanded clones; (4) 27 representatives of expanded clones appearing at both time points. One

155

hundred and fifteen of 122 of the antibodies bound to RBD indicating that flow cytometry

156

efficiently identified B cells producing anti-RBD antibodies (Fig. 3a and Supplementary Tables

157

4 and 5). Taking all antibodies together, the mean ELISA half-maximal effective concentration

158

(EC50) was not significantly different at the two time points (Fig. 3a, Supplementary Table 4 and

). However, comparison of the antibodies that were present at both time points revealed a

163

To determine whether the antibodies expressed by memory B cells at the late time point also

164

showed altered breadth, we compared them to earlier clonal relatives in binding assays using

165

control and mutant RBDs: The mutations E484K and Q493R16 were selected for resistance to

166

class 2 antibodies such as C144 and C121 that bind directly to the ACE2 interaction ridge in the

167

RBD

168

such as C135 that do not directly interfere with ACE2 binding

169

V367F, A475V, S477N, and V483A represent circulating variants that confer complete or partial

while R346S, N439K, and N440K were selected for resistance to class 3 antibodies

(Fig. 3c). In addition,

16,17,20

170

resistance to class 1 and 2 antibodies

(Fig. 3c). Out of 52 antibody clonal pairs appearing

171

at both time points, 43 (83%) showed overall increased binding to mutant RBDs at the 6.2-month

172

time point (Extended data Fig. 7b-k, Supplementary Table 5). For example, C144, an antibody

173

recovered at the 1.3-month time point, was unable to bind to Q493R or E484K RBDs, but all 5

174

of its 6.2-month clonal derivatives bound to Q493R, and one also showed binding to E484K

175

(Fig. 3d). Overall, the most pronounced increase in binding occurred for RBD mutations in

176

amino acid positions such as E484, Q493, N439, N440 and R346 that are critical for binding of

177

class 2 and 3 antibodies 16,17 (Fig. 3e, Extended data Fig. 7b-k and Supplementary Table 5).

178
179

Next, all 122 antibodies from the 6.2 month time point were tested for activity in a pseudotyped

180

SARS-CoV-2 neutralization assay

181

binding assays, the mean neutralization half-maximal inhibitory concentrations (IC50) values

182

were not significantly different at the two time points when all antibodies were compared (Fig.

183

4a and 1). However, comparison of the antibodies that were present at both time points revealed a

184

significant improvement of the IC50 values at 6.2 months (p=0.0003, Fig. 4b and Extended data

185

Fig. 8a).

1,7

(Fig. 4a, Supplementary Table 6). Consistent with RBD

186
187

To determine whether the antibodies exhibiting altered RBD binding also show increased

188

neutralizing breadth, we tested 5 representative antibody pairs recovered at the two time points

189

against HIV-1 viruses pseudotyped with E484G, Q493R, and R346S mutant spike proteins (Fig.

190

4c, Supplementary Table 6). Notably, the Q493R and E484G pseudotyped viruses were resistant

191

to neutralization by C144; in contrast, its 6.2-month clonal derivative C051 neutralized both

192

variants with IC50 values of 4.7 and 3.1 ng/ml respectively (Fig. 4c-d). Similarly, R346S

9

193

pseudotyped viruses were resistant to C032, but a 6.2-month clonal derivative C080 neutralized

194

this variant with an IC50 of 5.3 ng/ml (Fig. 4c, Extended data Fig. 8b-f). Consistent with the

195

observed changes in binding and neutralizing activity several late-appearing antibodies (e.g.

196

C051) had acquired mutations directly in or adjacent to the RBD-binding paratope (Fig. 4e,

197

Extended data Fig. 8g-j). We conclude that memory B cells that evolved during the observation

198

period express antibodies with increased neutralizing potency and breadth.

199
200

Antibody evolution occurs by somatic mutation and selection in germinal centers wherein

201

antigen can be retained in the form of immune complexes on the surface of follicular dendritic

202

cells for prolonged periods of time. Residual protein in tissues represents another potential

203

source of antigen. SARS-CoV-2 replicates in ACE2-expressing cells in the lungs, nasopharynx

204

and small intestine 21-24, and viral RNA has been detected in stool samples even after the virus is

205

cleared from the nasopharynx

206

the intestine after resolution of clinical illness, we obtained biopsies from the upper and lower

207

gastrointestinal (GI) tract of 14 individuals, an average of 4 months (range 2.8-5.7 months) after

208

initial SARS-CoV-2 diagnosis (Supplementary Table 7). Immunostaining was performed to

209

determine whether viral protein was also detectable in upper and lower GI tract, with de-

210

identified biopsies from individuals pre-dating the pandemic (n=10) serving as controls. ACE2

211

and SARS-CoV-2 N protein was detected in intestinal enterocytes in 5 of 14 individuals (Fig. 5a-

212

d, Extended data Fig. 9a-h and 10a-b, and Supplementary Table 7) but not in historic control

213

samples (Extended data Fig. 9i-l). When detected, immunostaining was sporadic, patchy,

214

exclusive to the intestinal epithelium and not associated with inflammatory infiltrates (Extended

215

data Fig. 9a-h and 10a-b). Clinically approved nasopharyngeal swab PCR assays were negative

25-27

. To determine whether there might be antigen persistence in

216

in all 14 individuals at the time of biopsy. However, biopsy samples from 3 of the 14 participants

217

produced PCR amplicons that were sequence verified as SARS-CoV-2 (Methods and

218

Supplementary Table 7). In addition, viral RNA was detected by in situ hybridization in biopsy

219

samples from the two participants that were tested (Extended data Fig. 10c-d) but not in historic

220

control samples (Extended data Fig. 10e). Sampling variability during the endoscopic procedure

221

likely contributed to incomplete concordance between detection of viral RNA and protein assays.

222
223

Neutralizing antibodies to SARS-CoV-2 develop in most individuals after infection but decay

224

with time 6,8,9,28-31. These antibodies are effective in prevention and therapy in animal models and

225

are likely to play a role in protection from re-infection in humans

Neutralizing monoclonal antibodies obtained from individuals during the early convalescence

period showed remarkably low levels of somatic mutations that some investigators attributed to

231

defects in germinal center formation

232

memory B cell response evolves during the first 6 months after infection, with accumulation of

233

Ig somatic mutations, and production of antibodies with increased neutralizing breadth and

234

potency. Persistent antibody evolution occurs in germinal centers and requires that B cells are

235

exposed to antigen trapped in the form of immune complexes on follicular dendritic cells 41. This

236

form of antigen can be long-lived because follicular dendritic cells do not internalize immune

237

complexes. In addition, even small amounts of persistent viral antigen could fuel antibody

238

evolution. The observation that SARS-CoV-2 mRNA and protein remains detectable in the small

239

intestinal epithelium in some individuals months after infection is consistent with the relative

240

persistence of anti-RBD IgA antibodies and continued antibody evolution 34-36.

241

Memory responses are responsible for protection from re-infection and are essential for effective

242

vaccination. The observation that memory B cell responses do not decay after 6.2 months 34,35,42,

243

but instead continue to evolve, is strongly suggestive that individuals who are infected with

244

SARS-CoV-2 could mount a rapid and effective response to the virus upon re-exposure.

Study participants. Previously enrolled study participants 1 were asked to return for a 6-month

337

follow-up visit at the Rockefeller University Hospital in New York from August 31 through

338

October 16, 2020. Eligible participants were adults aged 18-76 years and were either diagnosed

339

with SARS-CoV-2 infection by RT-PCR (cases), or were close contacts (e.g., household, co-

340

workers, members of same religious community) with someone who had been diagnosed with

341

SARS-CoV-2 infection by RT-PCR (contacts). Close contacts without seroconversion against

342

SARS-CoV-2 as assessed by serological assays (described below) were not included in the

343

subsequent analysis. Most study participants were residents of the Greater New York City tri-

344

state region and were asked to return approximately 6 months after the time of onset of COVID-

345

19 symptoms. Participants presented to the Rockefeller University Hospital for blood sample

346

collection and were asked to recall the symptoms and severity of clinical presentation during the

347

acute (first 6 weeks) and the convalescent (7 weeks until second study visit) phase of COVID-19,

398

Plasma samples from 80 out of 87 participants were tested by high throughput automated

399

serology assays. The Roche Elecsys anti-SARS-CoV-2 assay was performed on Roche Cobas

400

e411 (Roche Diagnostics, Indianapolis, IN). The Elecsys anti SARS CoV-2 assay uses a

401

recombinant protein representing the N antigen for the determination of antibodies against

402

SARS CoV 2. This assay received Emergency Use Authorization (EUA) approval from the

403

United States Food and Drug Administration (FDA) 5. The Pylon COVID-19 IgG and IgM

404

assays were used to measure plasma IgG and IgM antibodies against SARS-CoV-2, respectively.

405

Plasma samples were assayed on the Pylon 3D analyzer (ET HealthCare, Palo Alto, CA) as

406

previously described 4. This assay was implemented clinically as a laboratory-developed test

407

under New York State Department of Health regulations. Briefly, the assay was performed using

408

a unitized test strip containing wells with pre-dispensed reagents. The COVID-19 reagent

409

contains biotinylated recombinant versions of the SARS-CoV-2 S-Protein RBD and trace

410

amounts of N protein as antigens that bind IgG and IgM, respectively. The cut off values for both

411

Pylon assays were determined using the mean of non-COVID-19 samples plus 6 Standard

412

Deviations (SDs). The results of a sample are reported in the form of a cutoff index (COI) or an

413

index value (IV), which were determined by the instrument readout of the test sample divided by

414

instrument readout at cut off.

plasma samples were added in PBS and incubated for 1 h at room temperature. Plasma samples

424

were assayed at a 1:67 starting dilution and 7 additional threefold serial dilutions. Monoclonal

425

antibodies were tested at 10 μg/ml starting concentration and 10 additional fourfold serial

426

dilutions. Plates were washed 6 times with washing buffer and then incubated with anti-human

427

IgG, IgM or IgA secondary antibody conjugated to horseradish peroxidase (HRP) (Jackson

428

Immuno Research 109-036-088 109-035-129 and Sigma A0295) in blocking buffer at a 1:5,000

429

dilution (IgM and IgG) or 1:3,000 dilution (IgA). Plates were developed by addition of the HRP

430

substrate, TMB (ThermoFisher) for 10 min (plasma samples) or 4 minutes (monoclonal

431

antibodies), then the developing reaction was stopped by adding 50 μl 1 M H2SO4 and

432

absorbance was measured at 450 nm with an ELISA microplate reader (FluoStar Omega, BMG

433

Labtech) with Omega and Omega MARS software for analysis. For plasma samples, a positive

434

control (plasma from participant COV72, diluted 66.6-fold and seven additional threefold serial

435

dilutions in PBS) was added to every assay plate for validation. The average of its signal was

436

used for normalization of all of the other values on the same plate with Excel software before

Computational analyses of antibody sequences

514

Antibody sequences were trimmed based on quality and annotated using Igblastn v.1.14. with

515

IMGT domain delineation system. Annotation was performed systematically using Change-O

516

toolkit v.0.4.540

517

clonotypes were assigned based on their V and J genes using in-house R and Perl scripts

The frequency distributions of human V genes in anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies from this study

522

was compared to 131,284,220 IgH and IgL sequences generated by

523

cAb-Rep55, a database of human shared BCR clonotypes available at https://cab-

524

rep.c2b2.columbia.edu/. Based on the 82 distinct V genes that make up the 1703 analyzed

525

sequences from Ig repertoire of the three participants present in this study, we selected the IgH

526

and IgL sequences from the database that are partially coded by the same V genes and counted

527

them according to the constant region. The frequencies shown in (Fig. S4) are relative to the

528

source and isotype analyzed. We used the two-sided binomial test to check whether the number

529

of sequences belonging to a specific IgHV or IgLV gene in the repertoire is different according

530

to the frequency of the same IgV gene in the database. Adjusted p-values were calculated using

531

the false discovery rate (FDR) correction. Significant differences are denoted with stars.

Nucleotide somatic hypermutation and CDR3 length were determined using in-house R and Perl

534

scripts. For somatic hypermutations, IGHV and IGLV nucleotide sequences were aligned against

535

their closest germlines using Igblastn and the number of differences were considered nucleotide

536

mutations. The average mutations for V genes was calculated by dividing the sum of all

537

nucleotide mutations across all participants by the number of sequences used for the analysis. To

538

calculate the GRAVY scores of hydrophobicity 56 we used Guy H.R. Hydrophobicity scale based

545

this study were used to perform the test and 5,000 GRAVY scores of the sequences from the

546

public database were randomly selected. The Shapiro–Wilk P values were 6.896 × 10−3 and

547

2.217 × 10−6 for sequences from this study and the public database, respectively, indicating that

548

the data were not normally distributed. Therefore, we used the two-tailed Wilcoxon

549

nonparametric test to compare the samples, which indicated a difference in hydrophobicity

Biopsies and Immunofluorescence

558

Endoscopically obtained mucosal biopsies were formalin fixed and paraffin embedded. Sections

559

(5µm) were cut, dewaxed in xylene, and rehydrated in graded alcohol and phosphate-buffered

560

saline (PBS). Heat-induced epitope retrieval was performed in target retrieval solution (Dako,

561

S1699) using a commercial pressure cooker. Slides were then cooled to room temperature,

562

washed in PBS and permeabilized for 30 minutes in 0.1% Triton X-100 in PBS. Non-specific

563

binding was blocked with 10% goat serum (Invitrogen, 50062Z) for 1 hour at room temperature.

564

Sections were then incubated with a combination of primary antibodies diluted in blocking

565

solution overnight at 4°C. Slides were washed 3 times in PBS and then incubated in secondary

566

antibody and 4′,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole (1ug/mL) for 1 hour at room temperature. Sections

567

were washed in PBS 3 times and then mounted with Fluoromount-G (Electron Microscopy

568

Sciences, 1798425). Controls included, omitting primary antibody (no primary 995 control), or

569

substituting primary antibodies with non-reactive antibodies of the same isotype (isotype
