Abstract
The novel coronavirus (CoV) disease termed COVID-19 (Coronavirus Disease-19)
caused by SARS-CoV-2 (Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus-2) is causing a
massive pandemic worldwide, threatening public health systems across the globe. During this
ongoing COVID-19 outbreak, nucleic acid detection has played an important role in early
diagnosis. Here we report a SARS-CoV-2 detection protocol using a CRISPR-based CRISPR
diagnostic platform - CDetection (Cas12b-mediated DNA detection). By combining sample
treatment protocols and nucleic acid amplification methods with CDetection, we have
established an integrated viral nucleic acid detection platform - CASdetec (CRISPR-assisted
detection). The detection limit of CASdetec for SARS-CoV-2 pseudovirus is 1 × 104
copies/mL, with no cross reactivity observed. Our assay design and optimization process can
provide guidance for future CRISPR-based nucleic acid detection assay development and
optimization.
Results
The novel coronavirus (CoV) disease termed COVID-19 (Coronavirus Disease-19)
caused by SARS-CoV-2 (Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus-2) [1] is causing a
massive pandemic worldwide, threatening public health systems across the globe. During this
ongoing COVID-19 outbreak, nucleic acid detection has played an important role in early
diagnosis [2]. To date, 4 protocols based on CRISPR for detecting SARS-CoV-2 have been
published [3-6]. Using lateral flow protocols, RNA samples harboring more than 1 × 104 - 1 ×
105 copies/mL (SHERLOCK) or 1 × 104 copies/mL (DETECTR) can be detected within 1
hour. In addition to these reported efforts, we have also established a SARS-CoV-2 detection
protocol based on our previously reported platform – CDetection (Cas12b-mediated DNA
detection) [7]. By combining sample treatment protocols and nucleic acid amplification
methods with CDetection, we have established an integrated viral nucleic acid detection
platform – CASdetec (CRISPR-assisted detection). The detection limit of CASdetec for
SARS-CoV-2 pseudovirus is 1 × 104 copies/mL, with no cross reactivity observed. Here we
present our assay design and optimization process, which could provide guidance for future
CRISPR-based nucleic acid detection assay development and optimization.
To optimize the output of fluorescence signal, we designed and synthesized poly-T

fluorescence-quenchers of varying nucleotide lengths, namely 4 nt, 5 nt, 7 nt, 12 nt, 17 nt, 22
nt and 27 nt. Of all the lengths tried, the 7 nt poly-T reporter provided the highest signals in
the shortest amount of time (Supplementary information, Fig. S1a, b). Based on this
observation, we applied the 7 nt poly-T reporter in later experiments.
According to the published SARS-CoV-2 whole genome sequence [8], we designed 7
sgRNAs around the RdRp locus, as recommended by the World Health Organization (WHO)
[2] (Supplementary information, Fig. S2a). Due to its high similarity to SARS-CoV, we ran
initial experiments on both SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV plasmids. According to
fluorescence kinetics studies, sgRNA-3 stood out in not only being able to distinguish
between the 2 similar coronaviruses but also being able to produce the most distinct
fluorescence signal (Fig. 1a and Supplementary information, Fig. S2b-g).
As previously demonstrated, CRISPR is unable to detect any target DNA when there is
less than 1-10 nM of amplification product within the reaction mix [7]. Hence, increasing the
molecular collisions between CRISPR and target would be essential to improve sensitivity.
We found out that increasing the sgRNA concentration by 3 folds not only enhances the
fluorescence signal and the signal-to-background ratio, but also increases the rate of reaction
(Fig. 1b and Supplementary information, Fig. S3a-b).
Given that the average viral load in the plasma of SARS patients ranged from less than 1
to about 1000 copies per microliter [9], or 1 × 103 – 1 × 106 copies/mL, nucleic acid
amplification techniques are needed to produce sufficient DNA for CRISPR-based DNA
detection methods. Recombinase-aided amplification (RAA) can amplify substrates 1010
times at most (from aM to 10 nM) within 10-30 minutes at constant temperature between
37oC to 42oC, complementing the needs of CRISPR-based detection. Thus, we designed and
screened RAA primers that matched our previously optimized sgRNA-3 (Supplementary
information, Fig. S4a). Based on our screens, we found that by using the best primer pairs
together with sgRNA-3, we can detect SARS-CoV-2 RNA in samples containing 5 × 103
copies/mL (Fig. 1c and Supplementary information, Fig. S4b-c).
In addition, we aligned the selected primers and sgRNAs to the existing typical
coronavirus sequences to evaluate their specificity. We analyzed all SARS-CoV-2 sequences
that have been uploaded to GISAID up till March 26th 2020. Out of 1792 sequences on

GISAID, 1673 of them contained sequences matching our chosen primers and sgRNA. Only 3
of them have 1 mismatch to the forward primer and only 2 of them have 1 mismatch to the
reverse primer (Supplementary information, Fig. S5), suggesting that our selected sgRNA and
primers can be used for nearly all of the reported SARS-CoV-2 genomes. Meanwhile, we
aligned 12 typical human coronaviruses, and found that none of the whole set of primers and
sgRNA showed high similarity (Supplementary information, Fig. S6a-c).
The experiments above were conducted by executing RT-RAA nucleic acid amplification
and CDetection separately. However, it would be best to conduct both reactions within a
single tube for convenience and, more importantly, to prevent aerosol contamination which
happens when the reaction mixture has to be exposed to the environment midway through the
protocol. Hence, we tried to execute both the RT-RAA and CDetection concurrently within a
single tube. However, the combination resulted in a drastic decrease in sensitivity (Fig. 1c and
Supplementary information, Fig. S7). Therefore, in order to keep both the RT-RAA and
CRISPR reactions within a single tube, we executed the RT-RAA reaction within the tube
while keeping the CDetection reagents within the lid of the tube for 30 minutes, following
which, the CDetection reagents were spun down into the tube for nucleic acid detection, and
the resultant reaction mixture was imaged for fluorescence.
To validate the specificity of our method for SARS-CoV-2 nucleic acid detection, we
tested our protocols against 6 coronaviruses known to cause respiratory diseases (SARS-CoV,
MERS-CoV, CoV-HKU1, CoV-229E, CoV-OC43 and CoV-NL63). Consistent with alignment
analysis (Supplementary information, Fig. S6a-c), no cross-reactivity with other endemic
human coronavirus were detected (Fig. 1d). Our results suggested our set of sgRNA and
primers showed high sensitivity and specificity.
However, viral genomes are packaged inside capsid protein and need to be released.
Thus, to investigate the virus handling processes, we produced pseudoviruses by packaging
the target sequences of SARS-CoV-2, SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV into actual lentivirus particles
(Supplementary information, Fig. S8). These pseudoviruses were diluted serially and treated
with either virus genome extraction kits (spin column) or lysis buffer, respectively. Our results
demonstrated that the spin column treatment gave a lower detection limit of 1 × 104
copies/mL (Fig. 1e). On the other hand, the lysis buffer offered higher usability, but raised the

detection limit to 5 × 104 copies/mL (Fig. 1f). Due to the difference in detection limit between
spin column and lysis buffer, we suggest using the spin columns in hospitals, and using the
lysis buffer for point-of-care testing (POCT).
To make CASdetec more amenable for POCT, we have also constructed a portable dark
box containing a blue LED and demonstrated that the positive fluorescence signal generated
from the protocol can be visualized upon illumination by a blue LED (Fig. 1g). In conclusion,
we have established a CRISPR-assisted detection (CASdetec) platform which consists of
procedures including virus handling, nucleic acid amplification and CRISPR-based detection
(Fig. 1h). CASdetec can detect pseudovirus samples with more than 1 × 104 copies/mL, with
no cross-reactivity with other endemic human coronaviruses. In addition, we optimized the
workflow to run both reactions within one single tube without lid opening. This will thus
prevent aerosol contamination and reduce the false positive rate.
