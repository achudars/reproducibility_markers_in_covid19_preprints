Abstract
The recently emerged SARS-COV2 caused a major pandemic of coronavirus disease
(COVID-19). The main goal of this study is to elucidate the structural conformations of non
structural protein 1(nsp1), prediction of epitope sites and identification of important residues for
targeted therapy against COVID-19. In this study, molecular modelling coupled with molecular
dynamics simulations were performed to analyse the conformational change of SARS-COV1,
SARS-COV2 and MERS-COV at molecular level. Free energy landscape was constructed by
using the first (PC1) and second (PC2) principle components. From the sequence alignment it
was observed when compared to SERS-COV1 28 mutations are present in SERS-COV2 nsp1
protein. Several B-cell and T-cell epitopes were identified by immunoinformatics study. The ∆G
values for SARS-COV1, SARS-COV2 and MERS-COV nsp1 proteins were 4.44, 5.82 and 6.15
kJ/mol respectively. SARS-COV2 nsp1 protein binds with the interface region of the palm and
finger domain of POLA1 by using hydrogen bonds and salt bridges interactions. The present
study provided a comprehensive structural model of nsp1 by threading process. The MD simulation parameters indicated that all three nsp1 proteins were stable during the simulation run. These
findings can be used to develop therapeutics specific against COVID-19.

1. Introduction
In December 2019, the first epidemic novel coronavirus (SARS-COV2) was identified in Wuhan
city, China [1, 2]. Since the outbreak, WHO (World Health Organization) declared the
COVID-19 as a pandemic on March 11, 2020 and posed a global health emergency. The
causative agent of the COVID-19 disease is a severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2
(SARS-CoV-2). The worldwide number of coronavirus cases reached to 5,503,005 with a death
toll of 346,768 as of May 25, 2020 [3]. Although it was first reported from China, the number of
active cases in India, USA, Brazil, Russia, Spain, Italy, France, Germany, and UK have surpassed the cases identified in China (82,985). Almost all countries initiated social distancing and
locked down precautions to avoid human to human transmission for till date no human vaccine is
available in the market for COVID-19 treatment. Coronaviruses are enveloped, positive-sense,
single-stranded RNA viruses (ssRNA+) belonging to the Coronaviridae family. COVID-19 is a
member of beta coronaviruses, like the other human coronaviruses SARS-COV and MERS-COV
[2,4]. There are seven strains of human CoVs, which include NL63, 229E, HKU1, OC43, Middle
East respiratory syndrome (MERS-COV), severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS-COV or
SARS-COV1), and 2019-novel coronavirus (SARS-COV2), responsible for the infection of the
respiratory tract. Among these seven strains, three strains are highly pathogenic (SARS-COV1,
SARS-COV2 and MERS-COV) and are responsible for lower respiratory ailment like bronchiolitis, bronchitis, and pneumonia [5]. Sequence analysis of SARS-COV2 suggests that the
genome size of this virus is 30kb and encodes structural and non-structural proteins like other
CoVs. The two-thirds of the 5′ end of the CoV genome consists of two overlapping open reading
frames (Orfs 1a and 1b) that encode non-structural proteins (nsps). The other one-third of the
genome consists of ORFs that encodes structural proteins. Structural protein consists of S protein
(Spike), E protein (Envelope), M protein (Membrane), and N protein (Nucleocapsid) [6, 7]. The
Orf1a and Orf1b encodes a polyprotein which is cleaved into sixteen non-structural proteins
(nsp1-16) that form the replicase / transcriptase complex (RTC) [8]. Alpha and beta CoVs consists of 16 nsps, while gamma and delta CoVs, lacking nsp1, consists of 15 nsps (nsp2-16) [9].
The amino acid sequences of nsp1 are highly divergent among CoVs [10]. It is among the least
well-understood nsps, and other than in coronaviruses, no viral or cellular homologs are reported.

The nsp1 of SARS-COV inhibits host gene expression by blocking the translation process
through interaction with 40S ribosomal subunit and degrades host mRNA via the recruitment of
unidentified host nuclease(s) [11, 12]. SARS-CoV nsp1 inhibits the expression of the IFN genes
and the host antiviral signaling pathway in the infected cells. The dysregulation of IFN genes is
the key factor for inducing lethal pneumonia [13, 14]. MERS-CoV nsp1 also induced mRNA
degradation and translational suppression. SARS-COV nsp1 also regulates the induction of cytokines and chemokine in human lung epithelial cells [15]. Thus, nsp1 is considered a major possible virulence factor for coronaviruses. SARS-COV2 nsp1 antagonizes interferon induction to
suppress the host antiviral response. The inflammatory phenotype of SARS-COV and SARSCOV-2 pathology was also contributed by nsp1 protein [15]. The nsp1 protein of SARS-COV2
interacts with six proteins of the infected host cells. They are POLA1, POLA2, PRIM1, PRIM2,
PKP2 and COLGALT1. Four of these host proteins (POLA1, POLA2, PRIM1 and PRIM2) form
DNA polymerase alpha complexes. This events raise the possibility that the nsp1 protein of
SARS-COV2 may interact to DNA polymerase alpha complex and change its functional activity
to antagonise the innate immune system [8].
The main goal of this study is to propose a molecular model of the nsp1 protein and nsp1-POLA1 complex. The epitope sites of SARS-COV1, SARS-COV2 and MERS-COV nsp1 protein
were identified by immunoinformatics process. Molecular dynamics simulation, principal component analysis (PCA), and Gibbs free energy landscape (FEL) were performed to assess the
conformational changes of the SARS-COV1, SARS-COV2 and MERS-COV nsp1 protein. The
mutated amino acids of SARS-COV2 nsp1 protein were reported by using multiple sequence
alignment. The binding interactions of SARS-COV2 nsp1 protein and POLA1 were studied by
implementing protein-protein docking procedure to identify the important interacting residues at
the interface region. The epitope prediction and conformational analysis can be utilised in drug
design and vaccine development process by targeting the virulence factor nsp1.

2. Materials and methods
2.1 Sequence retrieval

bioRxiv preprint doi: https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.06.09.142570; this version posted June 10, 2020. The copyright holder for this preprint

The protein sequences of nsp1 were retrieved from the curated NCBI database [16]. The accession number of the nsp1 of SARS-COV1, SARS-COV2 and MERS-COV are NP_828860.2,
YP_009725297.1 and YP_009047213.1 respectively. The pairwise sequence identity between
COVID-19 nsp1 protein and each of the other HCoV nsp1 proteins (SERS-COV1 and MERSCOV) was calculated using the BLASTp (basic local alignment tool) [17]. To check the conservation pattern, multiple sequence alignment (MSA) of all of the nsp1 sequences was performed
using the Clustal Omega programme of the European Bioinformatics Institute (EMBL-EBI) [18].
2.2 Three dimensional structure prediction
The NMR structure of the non structural protein 1 (nsp1) of SERS-COV1 was identified by
Almeida et al in 2007 and deposited in PDB as ID no. 2hsx/2gdt [19]. Currently no crystallographic structure of nsp1 of SARS-COV2 and MERS-COV is available in Protein Data Bank
(PDB). So, in silico modelling study was employed to predict the three dimensional structure of
nsp1 of SARS-COV2 and MERS-COV by using the I-TASSER web server [20]. I-TASSER (Iterative Threading ASSEmbly Refinement) is a bioinformatics approach to predict the structure
and function of an unknown protein molecule. It first detects structural templates from the protein data bank (PDB) database by fold recognition or multiple threading approach LOMETS
[21]. The full-length atomic models are constructed by iterative template-based fragment assembly simulations. The predicted protein models are constructed by continuous assembling of the
aligned region with templates and initiating an ab initio folding for the unaligned regions based
on replica exchange Monte Carlo simulation process. This simulation method generates an ensemble of several conformations which are further clustered on the basis of free energy. The lowest energy predicted structures are subjected to a refinement process resulting in a final three dimensional protein structural model. I-TASSER (as 'Zhang-Server') has regularly been the top
ranked server for prediction of protein structure in recent community-wide CASP (Critical Assessment of Protein Structure Prediction) method experiments [22]. The modelled nsp1 proteins
were optimised to avoid any stereochemical restraints by steepest descent energy minimization
method. The stereochemical quality of the nsp1 proteins was validated by Ramachandran plot
using PROCHECK [23, 24]. The models were further validated by ProSA [25], ProQ [26].

2.3 Active site prediction
The ligand binding residues of nsp1 of SARS-COV1, SARS-COV2 and MERS-COV were predicted by COACH meta server [27]. COACH generates complementary ligand binding sites of
the target proteins by using two comparative processes, S-SITE and TM-SITE. These two methods recognize ligand-binding templates from the BioLiP database [28] by sequence profile comparisons and binding-specific substructure.
2.4 Prediction of T-cell (HLA class I and II) epitopes
The RANKPEP, sequence-based screening server was used to identify the T-cell epitopes [29] of
the nsp1 protein of SARS-COV1, SARS-COV2 and MERS-COV. This server predicts the short
peptide that binds to MHC molecules from protein sequences using the position-specific scoring
matrix (PSSM). All the HLA class I alleles were selected for prediction of epitopes of HLA class
I. For the prediction of epitopes of HLA class II, we selected some alleles such as DRB10101,
DRB10301, DRB10401, DRB10701, DRB10801, DRB11101, DRB11301, and DRB11501 that
cover HLA variability of over 95% of the human population worldwide [30].
2.5 B-cell epitopes (linear) identification
B-cell epitopes of the three nsp1 protein were predicted by using BepiPred and Kolaskar & Tongaonkar Antigenicity (http://www.iedb.org/) servers [31]. BepiPred for linear epitope prediction
uses both amino acid propensity scales and hidden Markov model methods. The cut off score for
linear B-cell epitopes prediction is 0.50. Kolaskar and Tongaonkar evaluate the protein for B cell
epitopes using the physicochemical properties of the amino acids and their frequencies of occurrence in recognized B cell epitopes [32, 33].
2.6 Molecular dynamics simulation
Molecular dynamics simulations are used to predict the dynamic behaviour of the protein
macromolecule at the atomic level. The nsp1 protein of SERS-COV1, SARS-COV2 and MERSCOV were subjected to MD simulation by using Gromacs v 2018.2 software suite [34] with
OPLS-AA force field [35]. The three systems were solvated in a cubic box with SPC (simple

point charge) water model [36] by maintaining periodic boundary condition (PBC) through the
simulation process. Sodium and chloride ions were added to neutralize the three systems. Each
system was energy minimized using the steepest descent algorithm until the maximum force was
found to be smaller than 1000.0 kJ/mol/nm. This was done to remove any steric clashes on the
system. Each system was equilibrated with 100 ps isothermal-isochoric ensemble, NVT (constant number of particles, volume, and temperature) followed by 100 ps isothermal-isobaric ensemble NPT (constant number of particles, pressure, and temperature). The two types of ensemble of equilibration method stabilized the three systems at 300 K and 1 bar pressure. The Berendsen thermostat and Parrinello-Rahman were applied for temperature and pressure coupling
method respectively [37]. Particle Mesh Ewald (PME) method [38] was used for the calculations
of the long range electrostatic interactions and the cut off radii for Van der Waals and coulombic
short-range interactions were set to 0.9 nm. The Linear Constraint Solver (LINCS) constraints
algorithm was used to fix the lengths of the peptide bonds and angles [39]. All the three systems
were subjected to MD simulations for 2000 ps.
2.7 Molecular dynamics simulation analysis
The MD simulations of three nsp1 proteins of SERS-COV1, SERS-COV2 and MERS-COV performed in this study were analyzed using various inbuilt scripts of GROMACS. Root mean
square deviation (RMSD), root-mean-square fluctuation (RMSF), radius of gyration (Rg) and
solvent accessible surface area (SASA) of all the three simulated proteins were analysed to check
stability of the systems. RMSD was evaluated using gmx rmsd to study the convergence of the
simulations. To calculate the RMSF for deviation in the position of atoms, gmx rmsf was used.
Rg was calculated to measure the protein folding and compactness by using gmx gyrate. The
SASA gives an idea of the area of the amino acids exposed to the surface, as measured by using
gmx sasa. The number of hydrogen bonds present within the three nsp1 was analyzed through
gmx hbond with default parameters. The subsequent analyses were performed using GROMACS
utilities, VMD [40], USCF Chimera [41], Pymol [42], and also the plots were created using xmgrace [43].
2.8 Principal components analysis (PCA) or essential dynamics

Principal components analysis or essential dynamics is a process which extracts the essential motions from the MD trajectory of the targeted protein molecule [44]. The nsp1 protein of SARSCOV1, SARS-COV2 and MERS-COV are used for this purpose. The initial step of PCA analysis
is to construct the covariance matrix which examines the linear relationship of atomic fluctuations for individual atomic pairs. The diagonalization of covariance matrix results in a matrix of
eigenvectors and eigenvalues. The eigenvectors determine the movement of atoms having corresponding eigenvalues which represents the energetic contribution of an atom participating in motion. The covariance matrix and eigenvectors were analyzed using the gmx cover and gmx anaeig
tool respectively. Gibbs free-energy landscape (FEL) elaborates the protein dynamic processes
by representing the conformational states and the energy barriers [45]. The FEL of SARS-COV1,
SARS-COV2 and MERS-COV was constructed based on the first (PC1) and second (PC2) principal components. FEL was calculated and plotted by using gmx sham and gmx xpm2ps module
of GROMACS.
2.9 Protein-protein docking
The molecular interactions of nsp1 protein of SERS-COV2 (COVID-19) with the catalytic subunit of human DNA polymerase alpha, POLA1 was analyzed by using the HADDOCK (High
Ambiguity Driven protein-protein DOCKing) programme. It is a flexible docking approach for
the modelling of biomolecular complexes. It encodes instruction from predicted or identified
protein interfaces in ambiguous interaction restraints (AIRs) to drive the docking procedure [46].
The coordinates of the solved structure of the catalytic domain of DNA polymerase alpha, POLA1 was downloaded from PDB database (PDB ID: 6AS7) and prepared for the docking experiments by removing water, ions and the ligands. The interface residues were utilized for the
docking procedure. The active residues of POLA1 (Asp860, Ser863, Leu864, Arg922, Lys926,
Lys950, Asn954 and Asp1004) were retrieved from the literature [47]. The active residues
(Leu16, Leu18, Phe31, Val35, Glu36, Leu39, Arg43, Leu46, Gly49, Iso71, Pro109, Arg119,
Val121 and Leu123) of nsp1 of SARS-COV2 were predicted from COACH server. The amino
acids surrounding the active residues of both proteins were selected as passive in docking procedure. Active residues are the amino acids from the interface region of the two proteins that take

part in direct binding with the other protein partner while passive residues are the amino acids
that can interact indirectly in docking procedure. Approximately 163 structures in 8 clusters were
obtained from HADDOCK server, which represented 81.5% of the water-refined models.
PRODIGY software [48] was used to predict the binding affinity and dissociation constant for
each nsp1-POLA1 complex from the best three clusters. PISA server (http://www.ebi.ac.uk/msdsrv/prot_int/) was used to calculate total buried surface area, nature of interactions and amino
acids involved in interactions at interface region.
3. Results and discussion
3.1 Sequence analysis and protein structure prediction
The sequence identity of nsp1 protein of SARS-COV2 with SARS-COV1 and MERS-COV was
84.4% and 20.61% respectively. Multiple sequence alignment (MSA) of nsp1 proteins was performed to identify the conserved residues. The amino acids marked as asterisk illustrate the positions of nsp1 protein that were highly conserved over the evolutionary time scale. The differences in the amino acid changes were also recorded. It was observed that compared to SARSCOV1 there were 28 mutations in the nsp1 protein of SARS-COV2 (Fig. 1). The three dimensional structure of nsp1 of SARS-COV2 and MERS-COV was modelled using the I-TASSER
web server (Fig. 2) The highly significant templates used in the modelling of the nsp1 protein of
SARS-COV2 and MERS-COV through I-TASSER are listed in Table 1. It was evident from the
high Z score (>1 means good alignment) and good coverage in case of most of the structural
templates, the generated threading alignment predicts a good and confident model in both cases.
The stereochemical quality of the model nsp1 proteins was validated on the basis of Ramachandran analysis of ψ/φ angle from PROCHECK. Examination of Ramachandran plot of nsp1 protein of SARS-COV2 and MERS-COV showed above 92% residues lie in the allowed regions
(Table S1). From ProSA and ProQ analysis, it is clear that the overall model quality of the nsp1
protein of SARS-COV2 and MERS-COV are within the range of scores typically found for proteins of similar size (Table S1). The important residues of the nsp1 protein of SARS-COV1,
SARS-COV2 and MERS-COV that are involved in the ligand binding process are listed in Table
2.

3.2 Defining T-cell and linear B-cell epitopes
Several studies revealed that specific T-cell response is required for the elimination of several
viral infections such as influenza A, SARS-COV, MERS-COV and para-influenza. These studies
conclude that T-cell mediated response is essential for the development of specific vaccine
[49,50]. CD8+ cytotoxic T-cells recognize the infected cells in the lungs whereas CD4+ helper Tcells are essential for the production of specific antibodies against viruses. Here we used RankPep server to predict peptide binders to MHC class I and MHC class II alleles from nsp1 protein
sequences by using Position Specific Scoring Matrices (PSSMs). The antigenic epitopes of three
nsp1 proteins with high binding affinity were predicted and summarized in Table 3 and Table 4.
Secreted neutralising antibodies play an important role to protect the body against viruses. The
entry process of the viruses is blocked by the SARS-COV specific neutralizing antibodies [51].
The Bepipred web server was employed for the linear B-cell epitope prediction study. SARSCOV1, SARS-COV2 and MERS-COV nsp1 proteins were used for this purpose. The Kolaskar &
Tongaonkar Antigenicity method was employed for the cross-checking of the predicted epitopes.
The linear B-cell epitopes of the three nsp1 proteins are depicted in Table 5. Both humoral and
cellular immune responses are important factor against coronavirus infection [50]. Finally, in
SARS-COV2 nsp1 protein, four epitope rich regions (15-27, 45-81, 121-140 and 147-178) that
were shared between T-cell and B-cell were reported. This information will be helpful in vaccine
designing study by targeting SARS-COV2 nsp1 protein.
3.3 MD simulation analysis
Conformational stability and structural changes of three nsp1 proteins were measured by several
parameters. The average value of backbone RMSD of SARS-COV1, SARS-COV2 and MERSCOV was 0.18 nm, 0.25 nm and 0.37 nm, respectively, which remained stable throughout the
simulation run (Fig. 3A). SASA analysis suggested that the exposure of the three nsp1 protein
surfaces to the solvent and the changes in solvent accessibility could lead to conformational
changes of the nsp1 proteins. Fig. 3B shows the variations in SASA for the SARS-COV1,
SARS-COV2 and MERS-COV nsp1 protein with respect to simulation time. The average value
of SASA of SARS-COV1, SARS-COV2 and MERS-COV was 68 nm2, 108 nm2, and 110 nm2 ,

bioRxiv preprint doi: https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.06.09.142570; this version posted June 10, 2020. The copyright holder for this preprint

respectively. The SASA values for the SARS-COV1 were reduced when compared with the case
of SARS-COV2 and MERS-COV. The increased SASA values of SARS-COV2 and MERSCOV nsp1 protein suggest a partial unfolding of the protein structure upon exposure to solvent.
Radius of gyration (Rg) is detected as root mean square deviation between the center of gravity
of the respected protein and its end. It detects the stability and firmness of the simulation system
and changes over simulation time due to protein folded-unfolded states.52 The average Rg value
was 1.35 nm, 1.75 nm and 1.6 nm for SARS-COV1, SARS-COV2 and MERS-COV respectively.
The gyration curve showed a decrease in the overall Rg value of the SARS-COV1 nsp1 protein
compared with the SARS-COV2 and MERS-COV, indicating that nsp1 protein of SARS-COV1
was in a compactly packed state and had stable folding (Fig. 3C). The gyration analysis of
SARS-COV1, SARS-COV2 and MERS-COV nsp1 protein indicates that no significant drift was
observed throughout the simulation run. The high RMSF values of SARS-COV2 indicated a
larger degree of flexibility in this protein compared with SARS-COV1 and MERS-COV (Fig.
3D). An overall trend of backbone RMSD, SASA, radius of gyration and RMSF indicated that all
three nsp1 protein systems were well equilibrated and stable during the simulation run. The formation of hydrogen bonds as a function of simulation time was also analyzed. The average number of hydrogen bonds of SARS-COV1, SARS-COV2 and MERS-COV were 65±8, 90± 5 and
110± 10, respectively (Fig. 4).
3.4 Principal component analysis (PCA) and Gibbs free energy landscape (FEL)
The overall pattern of motion of the atoms was monitored using the MD trajectories projected on
first (PC1) and second (PC2) principal components to gain a better understanding of the conformational changes in SARS-COV1, SARS-COV2 and MERS-COV. The eigen vectors described
the collective motion of the atoms, while the eigenvalues signified the atomic influence in
movement. A large distribution of lines indicated greater variance in accordance with more conformational changes in the SARS-COV2 nsp1 protein compared with SARS-COV1 and MERSCOV nsp1 protein. The trajectories of SARS-COV2 nsp1 protein covered a wider conformational space and showed higher space magnitudes. It was suggested that SARS-COV2 nsp1 protein
appeared to cover a larger conformational space due to its greater flexibility when compared with

bioRxiv preprint doi: https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.06.09.142570; this version posted June 10, 2020. The copyright holder for this preprint

the other two nsp1 proteins (Fig. 5). Gibbs free energy landscape (FEL) was calculated using
PC1 and PC2 coordinates of the three nsp1 protein molecules. The ∆G values for SARS-COV1,
SARS-COV2 and MERS-COV nsp1 protein were 4.44, 5.82 and 6.15 kJ/mol respectively. The
blue, cyan and green regions in the free energy landscape plot denote low energy states with
highly stable protein conformation while the red region signify high energy states with unstable
protein conformation. Conformational stability of the three nsp1 proteins with lower free energy
(global minima) can be inferred by a smaller and more concentrated blue colour (Fig. 6).
3.5. Molecular interactions of SARS-COV2 nsp1 with POLA1
The catalytic domain of DNA polymerase alpha, POLA1 is involved in the replication process.
The molecular association of SARS-COV2 nsp1 with POLA1 was predicted by the HADDOCK
programme. The nsp1-POLA1 docked complexes were analyzed based on Z-score and HADDOCK score (Fig. 7 & Table S2). PRODIGY was used to predict the binding energy for each
nsp1-POLA1 complex from the best there cluster. Three best docked complexes were selected on
the basis of lowest binding energy. (Fig. S1). The best energy values obtained were -13.0 kcal/
mol, -11.6 kcal/mol and -9.6 kcal/mol. (Table S2). Interface area, involvement of amino acids
and molecular interactions were calculated by PISA server. The interface area of the best docked
complex (ΔG = -13.0 kcal/mol) was 1260.9 Å2 and shown in Fig. 8A. Interaction studies of this
nsp1-POLA1 complex showed thirteen hydrogen bonds and eight salt bridge interactions at the
interface region (Table 6 & Fig. 8B). It was observed from the docking experiments that the
residues of finger domain (Lys923, Gln927, Gln932) and palm domain (Glu1060, Lys1020,
Lys1024, Asn1030, Lys1031 and Glu1037) of POLA1 are mainly involved in the binding process
with SARS-COV2 nsp1 protein (Fig. 7). The hydrogen bonds and salt bridges interactions play
an important role towards the stability of the SARS-COV2 nsp1-POLA1 complex formation.
4. Conclusion
COVID-19 pandemic leads to a health, economic, social and political crisis in the world. The
development of a specific targeted therapy could reduce the rate of infection. This comprehensive study represents an immunoinformatics approach towards the identification of specific B-

cell and T-cell epitopes of three nsp1 protein. Four epitope rich regions (15-27, 45-81, 121-140
and 147-178) that were shared between T-cell and B-cell were reported in SARS-COV2 nsp1
protein. The in-depth structural elucidation of nsp1 proteins together with dynamic conformations showed that SARS-COV2 nsp1 protein covers a large conformational space due to its
greater flexibility compared with SARS-COV1 and MERS-COV. A three-dimensional structural
model of the complex structure between SARS-COV2 nsp1 protein and catalytic subunit of DNA
polymerase alpha POLA1 was constructed using protein-protein docking approach. During complex formation between SARS-COV2 nsp1 and POLA1, salt bridge interactions help to bring the
two proteins in close proximity and form 13 strong hydrogen bonds that contribute to the stability of the complex formation. Knowledge of this important binding site could open the door for
further simulation and experimental studies on the mode of SARS-COV2 nsp1 protein recognition by the catalytic site of DNA polymerase alpha POLA1. Taken all together, according to
structural evaluation as well as immunological analysis, nsp1 protein could be considered as a
possible drug target and candidate molecule for the vaccine development process against
COVID-19.
