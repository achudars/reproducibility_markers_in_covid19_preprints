Abstract

22

The Covid-19 pandemic has highlighted the importance of aerosolized droplets inhaled into the

23

nose in the transmission of respiratory viral disease. Inactivating pathogenic viruses at the nasal

24

portal of entry may reduce viral loads, thereby reducing transmission and contagion. We have

25

developed an oil-in-water nanoemulsion (nanodroplet) formulation containing the potent

26

antiseptic 0.13% Benzalkonium Chloride (NE-BZK) which demonstrates safe and broad anti-viral

27

activity. While The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) have reported that BZK

28

may have less reliable activity than ethyl alcohol against certain viruses, including coronaviruses,

29

we have demonstrated that NE-BZK exhibits broad-spectrum, long-lasting antiviral activity with

30

>99.99% in vitro killing of enveloped viruses including SARS-CoV-2, human coronavirus, RSV

31

and influenza B. Furthermore, in vitro studies demonstrated that NE-BZK continues to kill

32

>99.99% of human coronavirus even when diluted 20-fold, while 0.13% aqueous BZK solution

33

(AQ-BZK) did not. Ex vivo studies of NE-BZK on human cadaver skin demonstrated persistent

34

>99.99% killing of human coronavirus for at least 8 hours after application. AQ-BZK failed to

35

demonstrate durable antimicrobial activity on skin over time. The repeated application of NE-

36

BZK, twice daily for 2 weeks on to rabbit nostrils indicated safety with no irritation. These

37

findings demonstrate that formulating BZK on the surface of proprietary nanodroplets offers a safe

38

and effective antiviral as a significant addition to strategies to combat the spread of respiratory

39

viral infectious diseases.

Introduction

42

The nasal cavity is a primary route of entry for respiratory pathogens. Recently published studies

43

on SARS-CoV-2 highlight the prominent role of nasal epithelium in initial infection, viral

44

replication, and transmission.1-3 Other highly contagious and pathogenic viruses such as influenza,

45

respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) and human coronavirus also enter through the nasal mucosa,

46

causing upper respiratory infection.4-6 Once inoculated, viral pathogens can spread from the nose

47

into the lower respiratory tract, causing morbidity and mortality from lower respiratory tract

48

disease. In addition, the infected individual can spread the disease through respiratory droplets

49

while coughing and sneezing. 7,8 The current Covid-19 pandemic has raised the urgent need for a

50

broad-spectrum antiviral nasal antiseptic that can prevent infection and transmission of pathogenic

51

respiratory viruses.

52

The CDC has reported varied antiviral activity of the widely used skin antiseptic AQ-BZK,

53

including that it can be ineffective against coronavirus.9,10 NE-BZK is a proprietary antiseptic

54

which incorporates the active ingredient benzalkonium chloride (0.13% BZK) in oil-in-water

55

nanodroplets. The nanodroplets are approximately 350 nm in size and have positively charged

56

surfaces. Given their size, they persist following application for up to 24 hours in hair follicles,

57

sweat glands and sebaceous glands which can harbor pathogens.11 While these nanodroplets are

58

small enough to penetrate these glands of the skin, they are too large to penetrate through the

59

epidermis and are therefore not absorbed systemically. With positively charged surfaces, the

60

nanodroplets repel each other which prevents the nanodroplets from coalescing and keeps the

61

active ingredient BZK from inactivating through crystallization.

62

viruses (e.g. SARS-CoV-2, influenza, RSV) are negatively charged.13 Therefore, the positively

63

charged nanodroplets in NE-BZK are attracted to these viruses, delivering the antiseptic payload

12

The surface of enveloped

64

directly to the surface of the pathogen where splitting and killing occurs. Ethyl alcohol products

65

comprise over 80% of skin sanitizers available in the U.S. and have been promoted by the CDC as

66

preferred for infection risk reduction.9,14 However, alcohol and water evaporate quickly after

67

application, leading to short duration of action. Similarly, in the case of widely available aqueous

68

0.13% BZK antiseptics, rapid evaporation of the water component leads to breakdown of the

69

positively charged BZK-containing micelles which determines antimicrobial activity in these

70

formulations. In contrast, evaporation of the water component of the NE-BZK formulation leads

71

to a residual liquid film of excipients adhering to the stratum corneum of the skin. The Poloxamer

72

407 co-surfactant in the nanoemulsion is a thermo-responsive hydrogel, which is bioadhesive at

73

the surface temperature of the skin and prevents crystallization of the BZK.15 These advantages

74

of NE-BZK present an attractive antiseptic formulation which can be tested for improved antiviral

75

effect in nasal preparations. We report data from in vitro and ex vivo antiviral testing of the new

76

formulation NE-BZK along with demonstration of in vivo safety of its intranasal application in

77

rabbits.

Results

79

Broad Spectrum Antimicrobial activity of Nanoemulsion with BZK Formulation

80

Our experience in this field predicts that formulating cationic surfactants such as BZK in the

81

nanoemulsion (nanodroplets) enhances its antiviral activity. Since the well-known antiseptic BZK

82

in standard aqueous solutions has demonstrated varied activity against viruses and bacteria,

83

including human coronavirus, we formulated BZK in oil-in-water nanodroplets. We evaluated the

84

broad-spectrum antiviral activity of NE-BZK against various enveloped respiratory viruses. Data

85

presented in Figure 1 shows that NE-BZK inactivated >99.99% of all tested enveloped viruses,

86

including SARS-CoV-2. The inactivation of these viruses was achieved within 5 minutes of

87

mixing with the nanoemulsion, indicating that the NE-BZK nanodroplets efficiently delivered the

88

BZK to the enveloped viral particles where inactivation occurs.

89

The results of these studies demonstrate that NE-BZK has sustained broad-spectrum antiviral

90

activity against multiple respiratory pathogens, including SARS-CoV-2, Influenza B, and RSV.

91

In Vitro Efficacy of Aqueous BZK in comparison to BZK formulated in Nanoemulsion

92

against human coronavirus (HCoV229E)

93

To demonstrate the persistent antiviral activity of NE-BZK despite dilution, which is inherent in

94

skin or mucosal application in vivo, we compared serial dilutions of NE-BZK and aqueous BZK

95

in the in vitro inactivation test against human coronavirus.

96

including full-strength (0.13% BZK), 1/10 dilution (0.013% BZK) and 1/20 dilution (0.0065%

97

BZK), were tested. Antiviral activity against human coronavirus (HCoV229E) in a time-kill study

98

following 5 minutes exposure was evaluated. Data presented in Table 2 demonstrate that even at

99

highest tested dilution of 1/20, the NE-BZK formulation continued to demonstrate >99.99% killing

Three different concentrations

100

while aqueous AQ-BZK antiviral activity was diminished with dilutions.

101

Durability of NE-BZK efficacy in ex-vivo Human cadaver skin

102

Following demonstration of in vitro activity against human coronavirus, an ex-vivo time- kill study

103

was performed following pre-treatment of human cadaver skin with NE-BZK (0.13% BZK) or

104

AQ-BZK for 4 and 8 hours. As presented in Table 3, NE-BZK achieved >4.7 log killing of HCoV

105

229E at both the 4- and 8-hour time points, while AQ-BZK exhibited only 1.5 log killing at 4 hours

106

and no detectable activity at 8 hours. These data suggest that NE-BZK could maintain its antiviral

107

activity for a longer time due to stability of this formulation compared to AQ-BZK formulations.

In-vivo Safety and Non-Irritating properties of NE-BZK product applied to Nasal Skin

109

Surfaces

110

Demonstration of broad-spectrum anti-viral activity of NE-BZK makes application to the nasal

111

cavity an option to reduce viral load, prevent colonization and lessen disease progression.

112

Therefore, we studied the safety of multiple daily nasal administration of NE-BZK in New Zealand

113

white rabbits. Following 2-week bi-dose intranasal application of NE-BZK, the nasal cavity was

114

examined for skin irritation according to the method of Draize.21 The nasal cavity was examined

115

for both erythema and edema and scored using the scale presented in Table 1, under materials

116

and methods section. None of the animals in the treatment group (N=8) exhibited any signs of

117

erythema or edema and were indistinguishable from the naïve group (N=4) 2 days following

118

completing 2 weeks of twice daily treatment. Furthermore, BZK values in serum samples

119

collected 2 hours and 2 days post application of the final dose were below the limit of detection

120

of BZK (<0.094 µg/ml) demonstrating that this treatment localizes in the nasal cavity and does

121

not reach the blood stream.

122

Discussion

123

NE-BZK includes in its composition a potent surfactant (0.13% BZK) that when formulated with

124

patented oil-in-water nanodroplets, demonstrates broad-spectrum antiviral activity against

125

enveloped viruses. The potent viral inactivation properties were demonstrated in cell culture

126

against major respiratory viruses including two strains of coronavirus (SARS-Cov-2 and Human

127

Coronavirus 229E), Influenza B and RSV. The nasal cavity is the primary port of entry to almost

128

all respiratory disease-causing viruses.(reference needed)

129

inactivates the virus at the portal of entry will be essential in preventing infection and viral

130

transmission.21.

An effective nasal antiseptic that

131

Benzalkonium chloride (BZK), a well-known effective and safe antiseptic, has demonstrated

132

variable antiviral activity in typical aqueous formulations. In order to enhance antiviral activity

133

and facilitate safe delivery in the nasal cavity, we formulated 0.13% BZK as the main cationic

134

surfactant component in a new oil-in-water nanoemulsion (NE-BZK). Nanodroplets possess high

135

adherence and residence time on epithelial tissue allowing for prolonged antiviral protection. Our

136

data demonstrate enhanced antiviral activity vs. commonly available aqueous 0.13% BZK

137

formulations.

138

The timeline of SARS-CoV-2 infection and resultant disease includes an approximately five-day

139

incubation period before disease symptoms are displayed. High viral load and infectivity is present

140

in infected individuals during this incubation period and 5-7 days post symptom onset. 22, 23 SARS-

141

CoV-2 nasal viral load has been shown to be the most significant predictor of severe COVID-19

142

disease including death.24 Therefore, intervention aimed at reducing nasal viral load in SARS-

143

CoV-2 infected persons would likely not only increase the probability of survival but also likely

144

reduce viral transmission to those in contact with the infected individual. Reducing viral load and

145

shedding in infected individuals would supplement recommended social distancing and use of face

146

masks to mitigate the Covid-19 pandemic. A recent article by Frank et al shows the in vitro

147

efficacy of povidone- iodine nasal antiseptic for rapid inactivation of SARS-CoV-2. However,

148

this approach has major limitations including patient experience of using povidone iodine in the

149

nose, allergic potential, and thyroid disease concerns. Povidone Iodine can become ineffective

150

when diluting from available commercial 5% or 10% solutions and can be effective only up to 4

151

hours post application25. NE-BZK has an added advantage that safety has been previously

152

demonstrated in humans through two different phase 1 clinical trials using the same nanoemulsion

153

technology with a similar cationic surfactant.26, 27 BZK at concentrations similar to those in NE-

154

BZK has been used in human skin products since the 1940’s and is currently marketed in numerous

155

nasal products.(reference) Hirose et al has shown the survival of SARS-CoV-2 on skin surfaces

156

for 9 hours28 which may require a more durable antiseptic activity. Our ex-vivo data has shown

157

that antimicrobial effect of NE-BZK was seen even 8-12 hours post application, and even when

158

diluting 20-fold, suggesting that application every 8 hours may be useful in protecting against

159

disease. Our in vivo safety study in rabbits also demonstrated no safety issues with twice daily

160

application of NE-BZK for two weeks, and BZK was not detected in the serum samples two-hours

161

post application, indicating no absorption into the systemic circulation.

162

We believe that NE-BZK antiseptic might fulfill a role in reducing viral loads in SARS-Cov-2

163

infected persons, potentially reducing the risk of disease progression and increasing survival.

164

Moreover, reduction of viral load during the isolation period may reduce transmission of the virus

165

to households and other contacts. The attractive safety, efficacy, and easy application of NE-BZK

166

antiviral warrants clinical evaluation as an antiviral nasal sanitizer to prevent or treat viral

167

infections in humans at risk for viral exposure during epidemics and pandemics.

168

Materials and Methods

169

Nanoemulsion Formulation with BZK: The nanoemulsion formulation was prepared with

170

0.13% benzalkonium chloride (BZK) as the active ingredient.16 BZK, a quaternary ammonium

171

compound, was chosen due to its inherent antimicrobial activity and is currently use in numerous

172

nasal spray and skin antiseptic products. In NE-BZK, the BZK resides at the interface between

173

the oil and water phases of the nanodroplets with the hydrophobic tail distributed in the oil core

174

and the polar cationic head group residing at the oil-water interface.

175

Virus strains used for Demonstration of Antiviral activity with NE-BZK: Broad spectrum

176

antiviral activity of NE-BZK was tested using the following viral isolates: SARS-CoV-2

177

Victoria/1/2020 strain (Public Health England (PHE), Porton Down, Salisbury, UK); Human

178

coronavirus 229E (ATCC: VR-740); Influenza B (VR-1931); and Respiratory Syncytial Virus

179

(BlueWillow Biologics in-house strain: NBL-14-001-2UC). The virus growth media was either

180

Minimum Essential Medium – Eagle with Earle's BSS (MEM Eagle EBSS) from Lonza

181

(Rochester, NY) or Dulbecco’s Modified Eagle’s Medium (DMEM) from Corning Inc (Corning,

182

NY). The cells used in the virus studies were obtained from ATTC (Manassas, VA): Vero E6 cells

183

(ATCC# CRL 1586) for SARS-CoV2, MRC-5 cells for HCoV229E (CCL-171 ATCC), MDCK

184

cells for Influenza B (CCL-34 ATCC) and Vero cells for RSV (CCL-81 ATCC).

185

In Vitro Determination of Antiviral Activity

186

Using the time kill procedures described in the Standard Guide ASTM E1052-11, the antiviral

187

activity of the NE-BZK was assessed by inoculating the formulation with a suspension of viral

188

particles (final concentration of 1.5-3.1 x106 PFU/ml).17 At a predetermined exposure time, an

189

aliquot was taken and neutralized to remove residual effect of NE-BZK by diluting at 1:100

190

dilution in cell growth media containing 1-2% FBS. A comparative inactivation of HCoV 229E

191

by NE-BZK and AQ-BZK was also evaluated by using the test samples at full strength, 1/10

192

dilution, and1/20 dilution. Concentration of active virus particles was determined quantitively by

193

plaque or TCID50 assay. Briefly, serially diluted samples were plated onto 80-90% confluent Vero

194

E6 cells for SARS-CoV-2, MRC-5 cells for HCoV229E, MDCK for Influenza B and Vero cells

195

for RSV. Plates were incubated for 5-7 days at 35°C for human coronaviruses and influenza B,

196

and at 37°C for RSV, under 5% CO2. After completion of incubations, plates were fixed, stained,

197

and counted for plaques. TCID50 was calculated by the Karber method as referenced by Lambert,

based on the presence of cytopathic effect in host cells.18 Number of PFU recovered from the test

199

sample was converted into log10 format and compared to an initial starting concentration to

200

determine a log reduction.

201

Ex Vivo Persistence of Antiviral Activity on Human Cadaver Skin following application of

202

NE-BZK

203

Cryopreserved, dermatomed human cadaver abdominal skin from Caucasian donors was obtained

204

from Science Care organ donor bank (Phoenix, AZ). The permeation and retention of each

205

antiseptic preparation in human skin was determined using the ex vivo permeation technique

206

described by Franz.19 Human skin was placed onto a Franz diffusion cell chamber and secured.

207

The skin was maintained at a temperature and humidity that match typical in vivo conditions with

208

a receptor phase maintained at 37C with the water bath and magnetic stirring. The surface

209

temperature of the skin was appropriately 32C as determined by an Infrared surface temperature

210

thermometer. Human skin placed onto a Franz diffusion cell chambers was dosed with either the

211

nanoemulsion antiseptic (NE-BZK) or aqueous BZK solution (AQ-BZK) applied at a single dose

212

of 100 L/cm2. Sterile water for injection (WFI) was used as a control. At either 4 or 8 hours

213

after the topical application, 10µL of viral particles in suspension (final concentration of 1-3 x105

214

PFU/ml) was applied to the skin surface for a contact time of 20 minutes. The skin surface was

215

then washed 2-3 times with 100 µL (each wash volume) of growth media. The washes were pooled

216

and neutralized to remove residual effect of the test formulation by diluting at 1:100 dilution in

217

cell growth media containing 1-2% FBS. Concentration of active virus particles was determined

218

quantitively by plaque or TCID50 assay as described in the earlier section.

In Vivo Rabbit Safety and Toxicology Study

221

The safety of NE-BZK was evaluated in New Zealand white rabbits following bi-dose nasal swab

222

application for two weeks. The exploratory study was performed at IITRI in accordance with

223

protocols approved by the animal care and use committee. The animals were acclimated to their

224

designated housing for at least 7 days before the first day of dosing. The animals were randomly

225

assigned to either naïve control or NE-BZK treatment groups with 2/sex in control group and 4/sex

226

in NE-BZK group. The animals for NE-BZK application were held with ventral side up when

227

intranasal swabbing was applied. The NE-BZK was applied to the inner nostril and nasal mucosa

228

using a puritan foam tip. Care was taken that swab was applied thoroughly in ten circular motions.

229

A clean swab was used for each nostril to prevent contamination. Two hours post last dose

230

application and two days later, blood was collected by bleeding the central ear artery. Serum was

231

analyzed by HPLC for BZK. The animals were sacrificed 2 days post last administration and nasal

232

cavity was examined macroscopically and scored for erythema and edema by Draize method of

233

scoring for dermal irritation as shown in Table 1.20

234

Analysis of Serum Samples for BZK

235

The serum samples collected at two hours and two days post NE-BZK application was analyzed

236

using qualified reverse phase HPLC method. The samples were extracted with three parts of

237

acetonitrile and filtered using 0.2µm low protein binding PTFE filter before injecting into column.

238

The samples were run on Phenomenex Luna 5µ column, using 0.04M Sodium acetate in

239

acetonitrile as mobile phase. The samples were run at a flow rate of 2mL/ minute with 100µL

240

injection volume. The peaks were detected using 254nm wavelength. The analytical assay

241

detection limit was 0.094µg/mL.

Conclusions

243

NE-BZK is a safe, non-irritating nasal antiseptic, which confers significant advantages over typical

244

aqueous BZK formulations. Transmission of SARS-CoV-2 and other respiratory viruses through

245

nasal droplets can be mitigated by inactivation of these enveloped viruses at the nasal port of entry,

246

which may limit both the severity and the transmission of respiratory disease. NE-BZK nasal

247

application may play a critical additional measure to prevent or reduce nasal viral load and in

248

mitigating the Covid-19 pandemic.
