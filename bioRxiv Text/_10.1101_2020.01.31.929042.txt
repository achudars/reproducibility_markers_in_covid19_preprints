Abstract: The emergence of a novel, highly pathogenic coronavirus, 2019-nCoV, in China,

25

and its rapid national and international spread pose a global health emergency.

26

Coronaviruses use their spike proteins to select and enter target cells and insights into

27

nCoV-2019 spike (S)-driven entry might facilitate assessment of pandemic potential and

28

reveal therapeutic targets. Here, we demonstrate that 2019-nCoV-S uses the SARS-

29

coronavirus receptor, ACE2, for entry and the cellular protease TMPRSS2 for 2019-nCoV-

30

S priming. A TMPRSS2 inhibitor blocked entry and might constitute a treatment option.

31

Finally, we show that the serum form a convalescent SARS patient neutralized 2019-nCoV-

32

S-driven entry. Our results reveal important commonalities between 2019-nCoV and

33

SARS-coronavirus infection, which might translate into similar transmissibility and disease

34

pathogenesis. Moreover, they identify a target for antiviral intervention.

One sentence summary: The novel 2019 coronavirus and the SARS-coronavirus share central

37

biological properties which can guide risk assessment and intervention.

47

Several members of the family Coronaviridae constantly circulate in the human population and

48

usually cause mild respiratory disease (1). In contrast, the severe acute respiratory syndrome-

49

associated coronavirus (SARS-CoV) and the Middle East respiratory syndrome-associated

50

coronavirus (MERS-CoV) are transmitted from animals to humans and cause severe respiratory

51

diseases in afflicted human patients, SARS and MERS, respectively (2). SARS emerged in 2002

52

in Guangdong province, China, and its subsequent global spread was associated with 8096 cases

53

and 774 deaths (3, 4). The virus uses Chinese horseshoe bats as natural reservoir (5, 6) and is

54

transmitted via intermediate hosts to humans. Thus, SARS-CoV was identified in Civet cats and

55

raccoon dogs, which are sold as food sources in Chinese wet markets (7). No specific antivirals

56

or approved vaccines are available to combat SARS and the SARS pandemic in 2002/2003 was

57

stopped by conventional control measures, including travel restrictions and patient isolation.

58

In December 2019 a new infectious respiratory disease emerged in Wuhan, Hubei

59

province, China (8-10). Initial infections occurred at Huanan seafood market, potentially due to

60

animal contact. Subsequently, human-to-human transmission occurred (11)

61

and the disease rapidly spread within China. A novel coronavirus, 2019-nCoV, which is closely

62

related to SARS-CoV, was detected in patients and is believed to be the etiologic agent of the

63

new lung disease (10). On January 28, 2020, at total of 4593 laboratory confirmed infections

64

were reported, including 976 severe cases and 106 deaths (12). Infections were also detected in

65

14 countries outside China and were associated with international travel. At present, it is

66

unknown whether the sequence similarities between 2019-nCoV and SARS-CoV translate into

67

similar biological properties, including pandemic potential (13).

68

The spike (S) protein of coronaviruses facilitates viral entry into target cells. Entry

69

depends on S protein binding to a cellular receptor and on S protein priming by a cellular

70

protease. SARS-S engages angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) as entry receptor (14) and

71

employs the cellular serine protease TMPRSS2 for S protein priming (15-17). The SARS-

72

S/ACE2 interface has been elucidated and the efficiency of ACE2 usage was found to be a key

73

determinant of SARS-CoV transmissibility (6, 18). SARS-S und 2019-nCoV-S share ~76%

74

amino acid identity. However, it is unknown whether 2019-nCoV-S like SARS-S employs ACE2

75

and TMPRSS2 for host cell entry.

76

Replication-defective vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV) particles bearing coronavirus S

77

proteins faithfully reflect key aspects of coronavirus host cell entry (19). We employed VSV

78

pseudotypes bearing 2019-nCoV-S to study cell entry of 2019-nCoV. Both 2019-nCoV-S and

79

SARS-S were comparably expressed (Fig. 1A) and incorporated into VSV particles (Fig. 1B),

80

allowing a meaningful side-by-side comparison. We first focused on 2019-nCoV cell tropism.

81

Transduction of cell lines of animal and human origin revealed that all cell lines were readily

82

susceptible to entry driven by the pantropic VSV glycoprotein (VSV-G) (Fig. 1C), as expected.

83

(Fig. 1C). Notably, 2019-nCoV-S facilitated entry into an identical spectrum of cell lines as

84

SARS-S (Fig. 1C), suggesting similarities in receptor choice.

85

Sequence analysis revealed that 2019-nCoV clusters with SARS-CoV-related viruses

86

from bats (SARSr-CoV), of which some but not all can use ACE2 for host cell entry (Fig. 2A and

87

fig. S1). Analysis of the receptor binding motif (RBM), a portion of the receptor binding domain

88

(RBD) that makes contact with ACE2, revealed that most amino acid residues essential for ACE2

89

binding were conserved in 2019-nCoV-S but not in the S proteins of SARSr-CoV previously

90

found not to use ACE2 for entry (Fig. 2B). In agreement with these findings, directed expression

91

of human and bat ACE2 but not human DPP4, the entry receptor used by MERS-CoV (20), or

92

human APN, the entry receptor used by HCoV-229E (21), allowed 2019-nCoV-S- and SARS-S-

93

driven entry into otherwise non-susceptible BHK-21 cells (Fig. 2C), indicating that 2019-nCoV-S

94

like SARS-S uses ACE2 for cellular entry.

95

We next investigated protease dependence of 2019-nCoV entry. SARS-CoV can use the

96

endosomal cysteine proteases cathepsin B and L (CatB/L) for S protein priming in TMPRSS2-

97

cell lines (22). However, TMPRSS2 is expressed in viral target cells in the lung (23) and entry

98

into TMPRSS2+ cell lines is promoted by TMPRSS2 (15-17) and is partially CatB/L

99

independent, although blockade of both proteases is required for efficient entry inhibition (24).

100

Moreover, TMPRSS2 but not CatB/L activity is essential for spread of SARS-CoV and other

101

coronaviruses in the infected host (25, 26). For initial insights into 2019-nCoV-S protease choice,

102

we employed ammonium chloride, which elevates endosomal pH and thereby blocks CatB/L

103

activity. Ammonium chloride treatment blocked VSV-G-driven entry into both cell lines studied

104

while entry driven by the Nipah virus F and G proteins was not affected (Fig. 3A), in keeping

105

with expectations. Moreover, ammonium chloride treatment strongly inhibited 2019-nCoV-S-

106

and SARS-S-driven entry into TMPRSS2- 293T cells while inhibition of entry into TMPRSS2+

107

Caco-2 cells was less efficient, which would be compatible with 2019-nCoV-S priming by

108

TMPRSS2 in Caco-2 cells. Indeed, the serine protease inhibitor camostat mesylate, which is

109

active against TMPRSS2 (24), efficiently blocked 2019-nCoV-S-driven entry into Caco-2

110

(TMPRSS2+) but not 293T (TMPRSS2-) cells while the CatB/L inhibitor E64d had the opposite

111

effect (Fig. 3B). Moreover, directed expression of TMPRSS2 rescued 2019-nCoV-S-driven entry

112

from inhibition by E64d (Fig. 3C), demonstrating that 2019-nCoV-S uses TMPRSS2 for priming.

113

Convalescent SARS patients exhibit a neutralizing antibody response directed against the

114

viral S protein (27). We investigated whether such antibodies block 2019-nCoV-S-driven entry.

115

Serum from a convalescent SARS patient inhibited SARS-S- but not VSV-G-driven entry in a

116

concentration dependent manner (Fig. 4). In addition, the serum reduced 2019-nCoV-S-driven

117

entry, although with somewhat lower efficiency as compared to SARS-S (Fig. 4). Thus, antibody

118

responses raised against SARS-S during infection or vaccination might offer some protection

119

against 2019-nCoV infection.

120

The finding that 2019-nCoV-S and SARS-S use the same receptor, ACE2, for entry into

121

target cells has important implications for our understanding of 2019-nCoV transmissibility and

122

pathogenesis. Thus, one can expect that 2019-nCoV targets the same cells as SARS-CoV and that

123

the previously documented modest ACE2 expression in the upper respiratory tract (23, 28) might

124

limit 2019-nCoV transmissibility. Moreover, it is noteworthy that ACE2 expression is not limited

125

to the lung and that extrapulmonary spread of SARS-CoV in ACE2+ tissues was observed (29,

126

30). The same can be expected for 2019-nCoV, although affinity of SARS-S and 2019-nCoV-S

127

for ACE2 remains to be compared.

128

Priming of coronavirus S proteins by host cell proteases is essential for viral entry into

129

cells and protease choice can determine zoonotic potential (31). The S proteins of SARS-CoV

130

can use the endosomal cysteine proteases for S protein priming in TMPRSS2- cells (22).

131

However, S protein priming by TMPRSS2 but not CatB/L is essential for viral entry into primary

132

target cells and for viral spread in the infected host (24-26). The present study suggests that 2019-

133

nCoV spread might also depend on TMPRSS2 activity and it is noteworthy that the serine

134

protease inhibitor camostat mesylate blocks TMPRSS2 activity (24, 26) and has been approved in

135

Japan for human use, although for an unrelated indication. This compound or related ones should

136

be considered for treatment of 2019-nCoV infected patients.

137

Convalescent SARS patients exhibit a neutralizing antibody response that can be detected

138

even 24 months after infection (27) and this is largely directed against the S protein. Moreover,

139

experimental SARS vaccines, including recombinant S protein (32) and inactivated virus (33)

140

induce neutralizing antibody responses. Our results, although limited in significance due to a

141

single patient serum being available for testing, indicate that neutralizing antibody responses

Cell Culture
All cell lines were incubated at 37 °C and 5 % CO2 in a humidified atmosphere. 293T (human,
kidney), BHK-21 (Syrian hamster, kidney cells), Huh-7 (human, liver), LLC-PK1 (pig, kidney),
MRC-5 (human, lung), MyDauLu/47.1 (Daubenton's bat [Myotis daubentonii], lung), NIH/3T3
(Mouse, embryo), RhiLu/1.1 (Halcyon horseshoe bat [Rhinolophus alcyone], lung), Vero
(African green monkey, kidney) cells were incubated in Dulbecco’s’ modified Eagle medium
(PAN-Biotech). Calu-3 (human, lung), Caco-2 (human, colon), MDBK (cattle, kidney) and
MDCK II (Dog, kidney) cells were incubated in Minimum Essential Medium (ThermoFisher
Scientific). A549 (human, lung), BEAS-2B (human, bronchus) and NCI-H1299 (human, lung)
cells were incubated in DMEM/F-12 Medium with Nutrient Mix (ThermoFisher Scientific). All
media were supplemented with 10 % fetal bovine serum (Biochrom), 100 U/ml of penicillin and
0.1 mg/ml of streptomycin (PAN-Biotech), 1x non-essential amino acid solution (10x stock,
PAA) and 10 mM sodium pyruvate solution (ThermoFisher Scientific). For seeding and
subcultivation, cells were first washed with phosphate buffered saline (PBS) and then incubated
in the presence of trypsin/EDTA solution (PAN-Biotech) until cells detached. Transfection was
carried out by calcium-phosphate precipitation.

Expression plasmids for vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV, serotype Indiana) glycoprotein (VSVG), SARS-S (derived from the Frankfurt-1 isolate) with or without a C-terminal HA epitope tag,
HCoV-229E-S, MERS-S, human and bat angiotensin converting enzyme 2, human
aminopeptidase N, human dipeptidyl-peptidase 4 and human TMPRSS2 have been described
elsewhere (1-6). For generation of the expression plasmids for 2019-nCoV-S with or without a Cterminal HA epitope tag we PCR-amplified the coding sequence of a synthetic, codon-optimized
(for human cells) 2019-nCoV-S DNA (GeneArt Gene Synthesis, ThermoFisher Scientific) based
on the publicly available protein sequence in the National Center for Biotechnology Information
database (NCBI Reference Sequence: YP_009724390.1) and cloned in into the pCG1 expression
vector via BamHI and XbaI restriction sites.

Mittelhäusern/Switzerland). After an incubation period of 1 h at 37 °C, the inoculum was
removed and cells were washed with PBS before medium supplemented with anti-VSV-G
antibody (I1, mouse hybridoma supernatant from CRL-2700; ATCC) was added (no antibody
was added to cells expressing VSV-G). Pseudotype particles ware harvested 16 h postinoculation,

Transduction of target cells: Target cells were grown in 96-well plates until they reached 50-75
% confluency before they were inoculated with the respective pseudotype vectors. For
experiments addressing the search for the 2019-nCoV receptor cells were transfected with
expression plasmids 24 h in advance. For experiments involving ammonium chloride (final
concentration 50 mM) and protease inhibitors (E-64d, 25 µM; camostat mesylate, 100 µM),
target cells were treated with the respective chemical 2 h in advance. For neutralization
experiments, pseudotypes were pre-incubated for 30 min at 37 °C with different serum dilutions.
Transduction efficiency was quantified 16 h posttransduction by measuring the activity firefly
luciferase in cell lysates.

Preparation of whole cell lysates: 293T cells were transfected with expression vectors for HAtagged 2019-nCoV-S or SARS-S , or empty expression vector (negative control). The culture
medium was replaced at 16 h posttransfection and the cells were incubated for an additional 24 h.
Then, the culture medium was removed and cells were washed once with PBS before 2x SDSsample buffer (0.03 M Tris-HCl, 10% glycerol, 2% SDS, 0.2% bromophenol blue, 1 mM EDTA)
was added and cells were incubated for 10 min at room temperature. Next, the samples were
heated for 15 min at 96 °C and subjected to SDS-PAGE and immunoblotting. Preparation of
pseudotype particle lysates: 1 ml of the respective VSV pseudotype were loaded on a 20 % (w/v)
sucrose cushion (volume 40 µl) and subjected to high-speed centrifugation (25.000 g for 120 min
at 4 °C). Thereafter, 1 ml of supernatant was removed and the residual volume was mixed with
40 µl of 2x SDS-sample buffer, heated for 15 min at 96 °C and subjected to SDS-PAGE and
immunoblotting
