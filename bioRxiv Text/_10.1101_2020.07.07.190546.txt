Abstract

29

SARS-CoV-1 and SARS-CoV-2 are not phylogenetically closely related; however, both use the ACE2

30

receptor in humans for cell entry. This is not a universal sarbecovirus trait; for example, many known

31

sarbecoviruses related to SARS-CoV-1 have two deletions in the receptor binding domain of the spike

32

protein that render them incapable of using human ACE2. Here, we report three sequences of a novel

33

sarbecovirus from Rwanda and Uganda which are phylogenetically intermediate to SARS-CoV-1 and

34

SARS-CoV-2 and demonstrate via in vitro studies that they are also unable to utilize human ACE2.

35

Furthermore, we show that the observed pattern of ACE2 usage among sarbecoviruses is best explained

36

by recombination not of SARS-CoV-2, but of SARS-CoV-1 and its relatives. We show that the lineage

37

that includes SARS-CoV-2 is most likely the ancestral ACE2-using lineage, and that recombination with

38

at least one virus from this group conferred ACE2 usage to the lineage including SARS-CoV-1 at some

39

time in the past. We argue that alternative scenarios such as convergent evolution are much less

40

parsimonious; we show that biogeography and patterns of host tropism support the plausibility of a

41

recombination scenario; and we propose a competitive release hypothesis to explain how this

42

recombination event could have occurred and why it is evolutionarily advantageous. The findings provide

43

important insights into the natural history of ACE2 usage for both SARS-CoV-1 and SARS-CoV-2, and a

44

greater understanding of the evolutionary mechanisms that shape zoonotic potential of coronaviruses.

45

This study also underscores the need for increased surveillance for sarbecoviruses in southwestern China,

46

where most ACE2-using viruses have been found to date, as well as other regions such as Africa, where

47

these viruses have only recently been discovered.

Introduction

49

The recent emergence of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) in China and

50

its rapid spread around the world demonstrates that coronaviruses (CoVs) from wildlife remain an urgent

51

threat to global public health and economic stability. In particular, coronaviruses from the subgenus

52

Sarbecovirus (which includes SARS-CoV-2, SARS-CoV-1, numerous bat viruses, and a small number of

53

pangolin viruses) [1] are considered to be a high-risk group for potential emergence. As both

54

sarbecoviruses that have caused human disease (SARS-CoV-1 and -2) use angiotensin-converting enzyme

55

2 (ACE2) as their cellular receptor [2,3], the evolution of this trait is of particular importance for

56

understanding the emergence pathway for sarbecoviruses. Bat SARS-like coronavirus Rp3 is a

57

phylogenetically close relative of SARS-CoV-1 but is unable to bind human ACE2 (hACE2) in vitro [4].

58

In contrast, other close relatives of SARS-CoV-1, including bat SARS-like coronavirus WIV1 and

59

WIV16, do have the capacity to bind hACE2 [5,6]. A number of other SARS-CoV-1-like viruses have

60

also been tested for their ability to utilize hACE2 [7–9] and comparison of their spike protein sequences

61

shows that viruses that are unable to utilize hACE2 unanimously have one or two deletions in their RBDs

62

that make them structurally very different than those that do use hACE2 [8]. As SARS-CoV-1, Rp3,

63

WIV1, and WIV16 viruses are closely phylogenetically related, the evolutionary mechanism explaining

64

the variation in their ability to utilize hACE2 (and likely also bat ACE2) as a cellular receptor has thus far

65

been unclear.

66
67

Chinese horseshoe bats (Rhinolophidae) are thought to be the primary natural reservoir of sarbecoviruses

68

[5,7,10–12]. Bats within this family are also considered to be the source of the progenitor virus to SARS-

69

CoV-1, as related viruses with high sequence identity to SARS-CoV-1 have been sequenced from

70

Rhinolophid bats, although none have high sequence similarity to SARS-CoV-1 across the entire genome

71

[7,13]. It is hypothesized that SARS-CoV-1 obtained genomic regions from different strains of bat SARS-

72

1-like CoVs in or near Yunnan Province by recombination before spilling over into humans [7,13,14]. In

73

particular, one region of SARS-CoV-1 that is known to have a recombinant origin is the spike gene, as a

bioRxiv preprint doi: https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.07.07.190546; this version posted January 22, 2021. The copyright holder for this preprint

74

breakpoint has been detected at the junction of ORF1b and the spike [13,15]. The SARS-1-CoV spike is

75

genomically very different from other viruses in the same clade that have large deletions in the receptor

76

binding domain (RBD) and are unable to use hACE2. The exact minor parent that contributed the

77

recombinant region is still unknown, but it was previously hypothesized that the recombination occurred

78

with a yet undiscovered lineage of sarbecoviruses and that this event contributed strongly to its potential

79

for emergence [13,16]. Recombination has also been shown within the spike genes of other CoVs that

80

have spilled over into humans and domestic animals and is potentially an important driver of emergence

81

for all coronaviruses [17–22].

82
83

In order for CoVs to recombine, they must first have the opportunity to do so by sharing overlapping

84

geographic ranges, host species tropism, and cell and tissue tropism. Sarbecoviruses in bats tend to

85

phylogenetically cluster according to the geographic region in which they were found [7,23]. Yu et. al

86

showed that there are three lineages of SARS-CoV-1-like viruses: Lineage 1 from southwestern China

87

(Yunnan, Guizhou, and Guangxi, and including SARS-CoV-1), Lineage 2 from other southern regions

88

(Guangdong, Hubei, Hong Kong, and Zhejiang), and Lineage 3 from central and northern regions (Hubei,

89

Henan, Shanxi, Shaanxi, Hebei, and Jilin) [23]. Studies in Europe and Africa have shown that there are

90

distinct sarbecovirus clades in each of these regions as well, herein named “Lineage 4” [24–29].

91

Sarbecoviruses appear to switch easily among co-occurring Rhinolophus species [30,31]; however, they

92

appear to rarely occupy more than one geographic area, despite the fact that some of these bat species

93

have widespread distributions across China.

94
95

Shortly after the emergence of SARS-CoV-2, Zhou et al. showed a high degree of homology across the

96

genome between a bat virus (RaTG13) sampled from Yunnan Province in 2013 and SARS-CoV-2 [3].

97

RaTG13 has also been shown to bind hACE2, although with decreased affinity compared to SARS-CoV-

98

2 [32]. Subsequently, seven full- or near full-length SARS-CoV-2-like viruses were published that had

99

been sampled from Malayan pangolins (Manis javanica) in 2017 and 2019 [33,34], one of which has also

bioRxiv preprint doi: https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.07.07.190546; this version posted January 22, 2021. The copyright holder for this preprint

100

been tested and found to bind hACE2 [35]. Neither SARS-CoV-2, RaTG13, nor the pangolin CoVs have

101

deletions in their RBDs. In contrast, the most recently described bat virus (RmYN02) is even more

102

closely related to SARS-CoV-2 than RaTG13 in the polymerase gene and was also found in Yunnan

103

Province; however, this sequence has deletions in the RBD and homology modeling suggests it likely

104

does not use hACE2 [36]. Together, these viruses form a fifth phylogenetic lineage (“Lineage 5”) that is

105

distinct from all other lineages of sarbecoviruses despite having been detected in Yunnan, where all

106

viruses found until this point had belonged to Lineage 1.

107
108

This finding of overlapping Lineage 1 and Lineage 5 viruses in geographic space is inconsistent with the

109

previously observed pattern of biogeography for sarbecoviruses. SARS-CoV-2 was isolated first from

110

people in Hubei Province and one of the pangolin viruses was isolated from an animal sampled in

111

Guangdong, neither of which are Lineage 1 provinces. However, the true geographic origins of these

112

viruses are unknown as it is possible they were anthropogenically transported to the regions in which they

113

were detected. For example, the Malayan pangolin (Manis javanica) has a natural range that reaches

114

southwestern China (Yunnan Province) at its northernmost edge and extends further south into Myanmar,

115

Lao PDR, Thailand, and Vietnam [37]. So, if they were naturally infected (as opposed to infection via

116

wildlife trade), the infection was potentially not acquired from Guangdong Province. Similarly, SARS-

117

CoV-2 cannot be guaranteed to have emerged from bats in Hubei Province, as humans are highly mobile

118

and the exact spillover event was not observed. If the clade containing SARS-CoV-2 and its close

119

relatives is indeed endemic in animals in Yunnan and the nearby Southeast Asian regions as suggested by

120

the presence of RaTG13, RmYN02, and the natural range of the Malayan pangolin, whatever mechanism

121

is facilitating the biogeographical concordance of Lineages 1, 2 and 3 within China appears to no longer

122

apply for the biogeography of Lineage 5, since they all appear to overlap in and around Yunnan Province.

123
124

Here, we report a series of observations that together suggest that SARS-CoV-1 and its close relatives

125

gained the ability to utilize ACE2 through a recombination event that happened between an ancestor of

bioRxiv preprint doi: https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.07.07.190546; this version posted January 22, 2021. The copyright holder for this preprint

126

SARS-CoV-1 and a Lineage 5 virus phylogenetically related to SARS-CoV-2, which could only have

127

occurred with the lineages occupying the same geographic and host space. We also report three full-

128

length genomes of sarbecoviruses from Rwanda and Uganda and demonstrate that the RBDs of these

129

viruses are genetically intermediate between viruses that use ACE2 and those that do not. Accordingly,

130

we also investigate the potential for these viruses to utilize hACE2 in vitro. Together, our findings help

131

illuminate the evolutionary history of ACE2 usage within sarbecoviruses and provide insight into

132

identifying their risk of emergence in the future. We also propose a mechanism that could explain the

133

pattern of phylogeography across Lineages 1, 2, and 3, and why Lineage 5 viruses (including SARS-

134

CoV-2 and its relatives) represent an inconsistency to this pattern.

135
136

Results

137

To better understand the evolutionary history of sarbecoviruses we first constructed a phylogenetic tree of

138

the RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp) gene, also known as nsp12 (Figure 1). The tree was

139

constructed using sequences from GenBank as well as three sequences of a novel sarbecovirus detected in

140

bats from Uganda and Rwanda as part of the USAID-PREDICT project. The three novel sequences share

141

>99% nucleotide identity to each other and ~76% and ~74% nucleotide identity with SARS-CoV-1 and

142

SARS-CoV-2, respectively. Phylogenetically, they lie within Lineage 4, clustering with previously

143

reported SARS-related coronavirus BtKY72 found in bats in Kenya [29] and bat coronavirus BM48-31

144

from Bulgaria [26]. The topology of the sarbecovirus phylogeny is uncertain with respect to the

145

placement of the Lineage 4 viruses, with some models placing them between Lineage 5 and Lineages 1, 2,

146

and 3, and others placing them at the base of the tree, depending on the methodology and alignment used

147

[3,38,39] (Supplementary Figure S1). Our results place Lineage 4 in the former position with high

148

posterior support for the RdRp gene, though the variability in this placement must be recognized. Figure 1

149

also demonstrates the same geographic pattern of concordance reported by Yu et al [23], where viruses in

150

each lineage show a clear pattern of fidelity with particular geographic regions. However, SARS-CoV-2

151

does not lie within the clade of bat sarbecoviruses that have been detected in bats in China to date but

152

rather forms a much deeper, separate lineage. The discovery of the “Lineage 5” clade containing SARS-

153

CoV-2 and related viruses in pangolins and bats is a deviation from the geographic patterns observed for

154

other sarbecoviruses.

155
156

To investigate the evolutionary history of ACE2 usage, we built a second phylogenetic tree using only the

157

RBD of the spike gene and compared it to the phylogeny of RdRp (Figure 2). This region was selected

158

because the spike protein mediates cell entry and because previous reports showed that SARS-CoV-1 and

159

SARS-CoV-2 both use hACE2, despite being distantly related in the RdRp [2,3]. Within the RBD region

160

of the genome, SARS-CoV-1 and all ACE2-using viruses are much more closely related to SARS-CoV-2

161

than to other Lineage 1 viruses (Figure 2). Interestingly, bat virus RmYN02 is no longer associated with

162

SARS-CoV-2 in the RBD and is instead within the clade of non-ACE2-using viruses. We also found that

163

within the RBD, ACE2-using viruses and non-ACE2-using viruses are perfectly phylogenetically

164

separated. The viruses from Africa and Europe form a distinct clade that is intermediate between the

165

ACE2-using and non-ACE2-using groups, but appears more closely related to the ACE2-using group.

166
167

While these viruses from Africa and Europe are slightly more similar to the ACE2-using group, they

168

differ somewhat in amino acid sequence from the ACE2-users at the binding interface, including a small

169

deletion in the middle of the sequence (Figure 5, region 2). Thus, to determine the ability of these

170

sarbecoviruses to use hACE2 and better delineate the boundaries of ACE2 usage, we performed in vitro

171

experiments in which we replaced the RBD of SARS-CoV-1 with the RBD from the Uganda (PDF-2370,

172

PDF-2386) and Rwanda viruses (PRD-0038) [8]. Single-cycle Vesicular Stomatitis Virus (VSV) reporter

173

particles containing the recombinant SARS-Uganda and SARS-Rwanda spike proteins were then used to

174

infect BHK cells expressing hACE2. While VSV-SARS-CoV-1 showed efficient usage of hACE2, VSV-

175

Uganda and VSV-Rwanda did not (Figure 3).

176

177

To try and explain why the African sarbecoviruses are unable to use hACE2, we modeled the RBD

178

domain of the sequences from Uganda (PDF-2370, PDF-2386) and Rwanda (PRD-0038). Unlike other

179

non-ACE2 binders, homology modeling suggests that the RBDs of these viruses from Africa are

180

structurally similar to SARS-CoV-1 and SARS-CoV-2 (Figure 4A). However, modeling the interaction

181

with hACE2 reveals amino acid differences at key interfacial positions that can help explain the lack of

182

interaction observed for the rVSV-Uganda and rVSV-Rwanda viruses (Figure 4B-C). There are four

183

regions of the RBD that lie within 10Å of the interface with hACE2, one of which is the receptor binding

184

ridge (SARS-CoV-1 residues 459-477) that is critical for hACE2 binding [32,40]. We have designated the

185

remaining regions as regions 1 (residues 390-408), 2 (residues 426-443), and 3 (residues 478-491) (Figure

186

5).

187
188

The sarbecoviruses from Africa evaluated here have a 2-3 amino acid deletion (SARS-CoV-1 residues

189

434-436) in region 2 (Figure 5). As many of the residues in this region make close contact with hACE2

190

(<5Å), it is possible that this contributes to the disruption of hACE2 binding. One of these residues,

191

Y436, establishes hydrogen bonds with human ACE residues D38 and Q42 in both SARS-CoV-1 and

192

SARS-CoV2 (Figure 4C). Notably, all other non-ACE2 binders also have deletions in residues 432-436.

193

While this deletion is thought to interfere or reduce binding, restoring a similar deletion (SARS-CoV-1

194

residues 432-437) in the S protein of a European CoV (BM48-31) with the corresponding consensus

195

segment obtained from Lineage 1 ACE2-binding viruses did not restore hACE2-mediated entry; only

196

replacing the receptor-binding motif (RBM) increased hACE2-mediated entry [8].

197
198

Moreover, sarbecoviruses from Africa contain additional amino acid changes at the interface that can also

199

contribute to hACE2 binding disruption (Figure 4C). hACE2 contains two hotspots (K31 and K353) that

200

are crucial targets for binding by SARS-RBDs and amino acid variations in the RBD sequence enclosing

201

these ACE2 hotspots have been shown to shape viral infectivity, pathogenesis, and determine the host

202

range of SARS-CoV-1 [41–43]. All sarbecoviruses from Africa contain a Lys (K) at SARS-CoV-1

bioRxiv preprint doi: https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.07.07.190546; this version posted January 22, 2021. The copyright holder for this preprint

203

position 479 within region 3 (positions 481 and 482 for Uganda and Rwanda, respectively), which makes

204

contact with these ACE2 hotspots (as compared to N479 or Q493 in SARS-CoV-1 and 2 respectively;

205

Figure 4C). K479 decreases binding affinity by more than 20-fold in SARS-CoV-1 [44]. The negative

206

contribution of K479 in region 3 is likely due to unfavorable electrostatic contributions with ACE2

207

hotspot K31 (Figure 4C) [42,45]. On the other hand, SARS-CoV-1 residue T487 (N501 in SARS-CoV-2)

208

interacts with ACE2 hotspot K353 and has a Val (V) in the viruses from Africa (residues 489 and 490)

209

(Figure 5). As with residue 479, the amino acid identity at position 487 contributes to the enhanced

210

hACE2 binding observed in SARS-CoV-2 [42,43,45]. The presence of a hydrophobic residue at position

211

487, not previously observed in any ACE2 binding sarbecovirus, might lead to a local rearrangement at

212

the K353 hotspot that hinders hACE2 binding. Indeed, most non-ACE2 binders have a Val (V) in SARS-

213

CoV-1 position 487 (Figure 5).

214
215

Finally, the receptor binding ridge, which is conspicuously absent from all non-ACE2 binders, is present

216

in the sarbecoviruses from Africa but has amino acid variations that differ significantly from both SARS-

217

CoV-1 and SARS-CoV-2 (Figure 5). Changes in the structure of this ridge contribute to increased binding

218

affinity of SARS-CoV-2, as a Pro-Pro-Ala (PPA) motif in SARS-CoV-1 (residues 469-471) replaced with

219

Gly-Val-Glu-Gly (GVEG) in SARS-CoV-2 results in a more compact loop and better binding with

220

hACE2 [32]. Changes within this ridge may be negatively contributing to hACE2 binding of viruses from

221

Africa, which have Ser-Thr-Ser-Gln (STSQ) or Ser-Iso-Ser-Gln (SISQ) in this position (Figure 4C and 5).

222
223

While our studies suggest that these viruses from Africa do not utilize hACE2, it is not clear whether they

224

are still ACE2-users but are adapted to divergent forms of bat ACE2 in their natural hosts. The specific

225

bat host species for the Uganda and Rwanda viruses reported here could not be definitively identified in

226

the field or in the lab, but are all genetically identical. They may represent a cryptic species, as the

227

mitochondrial sequences are ~94% identical with Rhinolophus ferrumequinum in the cytochrome oxidase

228

I gene (COI) and ~96% identical with Rhinolophus clivosus in the cytochrome b (cytb) gene, each of

229

which have been deposited in GenBank (accessions MT738926-MT738928, MT732776). We were also

230

able to extract ACE2 sequences from the deep sequencing reads of PDF-2370 (GenBank accession

231

MW183243) to compare it to ACE2 sequences from species that are known to host ACE2 binders

232

(human, civet, pangolin), non-ACE2 binders (R. macrotis, pearsonii, pusillus, ferrumequinum), and both

233

(R. sinicus). Comparison of the ACE2 sequences shows that they are highly similar, with only a few

234

amino acids that are changed in hosts of viruses that utilize ACE2 compared to the host of our African bat

235

sample (Supplementary File 1). R. sinicus in particular is a known host of viruses that utilize ACE2 as

236

well as viruses with the deletions that do not, suggesting that adaptation to divergent bat ACE2 is not a

237

likely explanation for the deviation in sequence and structure of the RBD of viruses with deletions,

238

including the novel sarbecoviruses from Uganda and Rwanda. These findings provide additional

239

structural evidence that aids in distinguishing viruses which bind ACE2 from those that do not. They also

240

demonstrate that ACE2 usage within sarbecoviruses is restricted to those viruses within the SARS-CoV-1

241

and SARS-CoV-2 clade in the RBD (Lineages 1 and 5, Figure 2).

242
243

The finding of discordant evolutionary trees for RdRp and the RBD in Figure 2 more strongly supports a

244

recombination scenario; however, to consider an alternate scenario where ACE2 usage arose in Lineages

245

1 and 5 independently through convergent evolution, we compared the RdRp phylogeny with the amino

246

acid sequences of the interfacial residues in the RBD (Figure 5). When mapped to the RdRp tree, the

247

‘extra’ RBD sequence present in the ACE2-using viruses is conspicuous within the Lineage 1 clade of

248

otherwise non-ACE2-using viruses that have large deletions. We also note that there are two distinct

249

groups of RBD sequences within ACE2-using Lineage 1 viruses: Type 1, containing SARS-CoV-1,

250

SARS-SZ3 (civet), Rs3367, WIV1, Rs7327, YN2018B, Rs9401, WIV16, Rs4874, and LYRa11, and

251

Type 2, containing Rs4231, Rs4084, and RsSHC014. Further, RmYN02 is within the Lineage 5 clade of

252

ACE2-using viruses in RdRp but its RBD sequence contains both deletions (Figure 5). Without

253

recombination, the viruses with deletions in region 2 and in the receptor binding ridge would have had to

254

be gained and lost in precisely the same positions for ACE2-using Lineage 1 viruses and RmYN02,

255

respectively, which is not a parsimonious explanation. The phylogeny and sequence in Figure 5 also

256

illustrate that ACE2-usage appears to be an ancestral trait conserved in Lineage 5 [39] and a derived trait

257

in each of the 13 Lineage 1 viruses with ACE2-using structure.

258
259

Finally, we further investigated support for the recombination scenario by examining the region of

260

sequence between RdRp and the RBD for possible breakpoints. Only the 13 Lineage 1 viruses with

261

ACE2-using structure were targets of this analysis as we were primarily interested in explaining the

262

discordant phylogeny and variation in ACE2 usage (Figure 2), not in fully describing the recombination

263

history of every sarbecovirus. Using 3SEQ, we show that all of the ACE2-using Lineage 1 sequences

264

show extensive evidence of recombination within S1 and the RBD specifically (Table 2, Figure 6A).

265

Further, the assignment of the parental sequence that donated the recombinant region (the minor parent)

266

always resulted in the identification of one of the other recombinant sequences. This would not have been

267

possible, as the recombinant region would have had to come from somewhere other than these 13

268

sequences, indicating that the true minor parent does not exist in our alignment. Using these breakpoints,

269

we designated six subregions that were relatively free of recombination within these 13 sequences,

270

mirroring the approach of Boni et al. 2020 [39], and built phylogenetic trees for each region. We show

271

that in orf1ab (region A) and S2 (region F) these 13 sequences fall within Lineage 1, but within S1 and

272

particularly the RBD (B through E) they switch phylogenetic positions and cluster with Lineage 5 (Figure

273

6B), supporting the recombination scenario.

274
275

Despite only investigating the Lineage 1 recombinants for the locations of sequence breakpoints, the

276

phylogenetic trees provide evidence that recombination has occurred frequently in other sarbecoviruses in

277

this genomic region as well (Figure 6B). Of note, Rs4084 and RsSHC014 cluster with Type 1 RBDs in

278

regions B, C, and D, but with swap to cluster with Rs4231 (Type 2) in Region E, even though Rs4084,

279

RsSHC014, WIV1, and Rs3367 are all nearly identical in every other region. This suggests that a

280

WIV1/Rs3367-like Type 1 virus which had already undergone recombination in regions B through E

281

underwent a second recombination event with a Type 2 virus on top of the first in region E. A number of

282

other viruses also appear to have recombinant history in regions B, C, and D (SL-CoVZC45 and SL-

283

CoVZXC21, YN2013, Anlong-103, and Anlong 112), but these viruses do not show evidence of

284

recombination that spans the RBD in region E, which contains the amino acid deletions in region 2 and

285

the receptor binding ridge and appears to primarily determine ACE2-using potential. The frequency of

286

recombination in this region among Lineage 1 viruses strongly supports the hypothesis that after ACE2-

287

usage was acquired in Lineage 1, it subsequently spread throughout the clade via additional

288

recombination events with other Lineage 1 viruses.

289
290

As all of our evidence supports a recombination scenario over convergent evolution, we sought to

291

construct a possible timeline of events that could explain our observations. Using tip dating in BEAST2,

292

we constructed a time-calibrated phylogeny for RdRp using a substitution rate prior inferred from Boni et

293

al. 2020 [39]. Using the RdRp tree as an evolutionary backbone, the deletions in region 2 and the receptor

294

binding ridge of the RBD appear to have been lost in a stepwise fashion (Figure 5). The small deletion in

295

region 2 likely arose first, before the diversification of Lineage 4 in Africa and Europe (Figure 5) and was

296

dated using the MRCA of Lineages 1, 2, 3 and 4 (Figure 8). Alternatively, as the boundaries of the

297

deletion in region 2 in Lineage 4 and Lineages 1, 2, and 3 do not align perfectly and there is uncertainty in

298

the position of this branch in the phylogeny, it is equally possible that this deletion was lost independently

299

in Lineage 4. The larger deletion in the receptor binding ridge, not present in known sequences from

300

Lineage 4, likely arose second, but before the diversification of Lineages 1, 2, and 3 (Figure 5) and was

301

dated with the MRCA of these three lineages (Figure 8). Because no ACE2-using viruses have been

302

discovered in Lineage 2 or 3 to date, we propose that the re-appearance of this trait arose after the MRCA

303

of Lineage 1 on the tree (Figure 8). As SARS-CoV-1 was the earliest Lineage 1 virus sequenced with

304

ACE2-using structure, the emergence of ACE2 usage in Lineage 1 must have occurred in the time

305

between the MRCA of Lineage 1 (1852, 95% HPD 1804-1901) and the emergence of SARS-CoV-1 in

306

2003.

307
308

Next, we constructed a time-calibrated phylogeny for RBD with a strict MRCA age prior informed by the

309

estimation of the tree height in RdRp (see Methods), such that the timescale would be comparable even

310

though the evolutionary rates between these two regions likely are not the same (Figure 7). To account for

311

variability in lineage-specific substitution rates, we also generated a time-calibrated model using a relaxed

312

lognormal clock (Figure 7). Comparing the time-calibrated RBD tree to the time-calibrated RdRp tree, the

313

divergence dates for the two types of RBD sequence observed in the recombinant Lineage 1 sequences

314

are incompatible, suggesting that more than one recombination event donating ACE2 usage from Lineage

315

5 to Lineage 1 must have occurred. The 13 Lineage 1 recombinants (both Type 1 and Type 2) coalesce

316

between 119-216 years ago in RdRp and between 259-490 years ago in the RBD (Figure 7). If these time

317

estimates reflect true rates of diversification, a single introduction of the ACE2-using phenotype via

318

recombination would not allow enough time for the sequence divergence between Type 1 and Type 2

319

RBDs to accumulate, even when accounting for the substitution rate in RBD being estimated as an order

320

of magnitude higher than that of RdRp (5.248e-4 in RdRp, 2.181e-3 in RBD). Further, the substitution

321

rate that would be needed for the observed sequence divergence in the RBD of the 13 recombinants to

322

have accumulated since their MRCA in RdRp (1852) is more than double the estimated rate of our time-

323

calibrated tree (5.899e-3). Even with a relaxed clock assumption, the maximum value of the posterior

324

distribution of the mean rate is only 4.733e-3. From this, we conclude that two independent

325

recombination events occurred between Lineage 5 and Lineage 1 resulting in two distinct RBD types.

326
327

We propose two main hypotheses for the acquisition and spread of the two distinct RBD types donating

328

ACE2 usage from Lineage 5 to Lineage 1. The recombination hypothesis posits that two recombination

329

events donated Type 1 and Type 2 RBD sequence from Lineage 5 to Lineage 1; however, these two

330

events are insufficient to explain the non-monophyletic pattern of ACE2 usage in Lineage 1. We further

331

hypothesize that whichever Lineage 1 virus first gained Type 1 and Type 2 ACE2 usage in each group

332

then donated the trait to other Lineage 1 viruses through subsequent recombination events (Figure 8). It is

bioRxiv preprint doi: https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.07.07.190546; this version posted January 22, 2021. The copyright holder for this preprint

333

difficult to approximate a date for such an event, but the MRCA of the Type 1 recombinants in the RBD

334

may be a close estimation (between 42 and 77 years ago) (Figure 7). The events must have been recent

335

enough that the observed diversity of Type 2 RBD sequences is quite low, yet not so recent such that

336

there would not have been time for recombination to have occurred twice in region E for sequences

337

Rs4084 and RsSHC014 (Figure 6B).

338
339

The second hypothesis and only remaining possibility for ACE2 usage in Lineage 1 (besides

340

convergence) is that perhaps the trait persisted in this Lineage from the ancestral state (Figure 8). Because

341

no viruses demonstrating ACE2 usage have been discovered in Lineages 2, 3, and 4, this would mean that

342

the ACE2 usage trait would have been lost via deletion in these lineages. Further, because of the non-

343

monophyletic branching order of these lineages, this would require multiple independent and identical

344

losses of the region 2 and receptor binding ridge deletions in all three of these lineages. If this did indeed

345

occur, in order to then observe the pattern of ACE2 usage in Lineage 1 where some viruses, but not all,

346

have the ACE2 usage trait, further independent losses would be required in individual viruses. In much

347

the same manner as convergence would require multiple independent and identical events, persistence of

348

ACE2 usage with multiple independent deletions for the entire clades of Lineages 2, 3, and 4 and only

349

some of the viruses in Lineage 1 is also highly non-parsimonious. Persistence is also a poor explanation

350

for the pattern of the two RBD types observed, particularly for Type 2, where the RBD sequences are

351

highly similar but the RdRp sequences are quite divergent. If both genes were vertically inherited via

352

persistence, we would expect these genes to have approximately equal MRCA ages. Instead, we observe

353

that the MRCA age for Type 2 RBDs in region E are much younger than for RdRp.

354
355

Discussion

356

ACE2 usage in Lineage 1 viruses was acquired via recombination

357

At first glance, ACE2 usage does not appear to be phylogenetically conserved among sarbecoviruses,

358

especially since many phylogenies are built using RdRp. This naturally leads to the hypothesis that ACE2

bioRxiv preprint doi: https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.07.07.190546; this version posted January 22, 2021. The copyright holder for this preprint

359

usage arose independently in SARS-CoV-1 and SARS-CoV-2 via convergent evolution. This has been

360

suggested previously for another ACE2-using human coronavirus, NL63 [46]. However, a phylogeny

361

constructed using the RBD perfectly separates viruses that have been shown to utilize ACE2 from those

362

that do not (Figure 2). Viruses that cannot utilize ACE2 have significant differences in their RBDs,

363

including large deletions in critical interfacial residues and low amino acid identity with viruses that do

364

use ACE2 (Figure 5). Notably, in addition to the large deletions, viruses that cannot use ACE2 deviate

365

considerably at the interacting surface, including positions that play fundamental roles dictating binding

366

and cross-species transmission [32,41,44,47]. It is unknown whether viruses that cannot use hACE2 are

367

utilizing bat ACE2 or an entirely different receptor altogether, but since mammalian ACE2 is so

368

conserved [48,49] and ACE2-using viruses demonstrate broad host tropism [42,50–52], we hypothesize

369

that there is likely a different receptor involved for the non-ACE2 users (see Supplementary File 1).

370
371

The difference in topology, specifically in the positioning of ACE2-using Lineage 1 viruses, between

372

RdRp and RBD trees suggests that the ability to use ACE2 was introduced into Lineage 1 by

373

recombination between a recent ancestor of the ACE2-using Lineage 1 viruses (including SARS-CoV-1)

374

and an undiscovered Lineage 5 virus in the RBD. As there are two types of closely related RBD

375

sequences in the recombinant Lineage 1 viruses (Figure 2) with incompatible divergence dates (Figure 7),

376

we suggest that two such recombination events occurred between Lineage 1 and Lineage 5 (Figure 8)

377

independently introducing ACE2-usage into Lineage 1. The non-monophyletic nature of ACE2 usage

378

within Lineage 1 can then be most parsimoniously explained by secondary intra-lineage recombination

379

events (Figure 8). It is possible that both hypotheses are partially true and that both intra-lineage

380

recombination as well as the persistence of this trait alongside sister Lineage 1 viruses without the trait

381

gave rise to the observed patterns of Type 1 and Type 2 ACE2 usage within Lineage 1. It is also very

382

possible that further sampling may illuminate that some of the events proposed here have been distorted

383

by sampling bias. We have estimated that these events may have occurred roughly within the last two

384

centuries, though this estimate will likely change with further sampling as well. Our intention is not

385

necessarily to date these events exactly, but rather to infer their order relative to each other and to make

386

hypotheses based on this order of events. Confidence intervals for many node dates overlap, but high

387

posterior probabilities on internal nodes indicate that events most likely occurred in a certain order.

388
389

Our conclusion that ACE2 usage originated in Lineage 5 and was introduced into Lineage 1 by

390

recombination is based on phylogenetics; however, studies of recombination using phylogenetics are

391

often limited in their ability to definitively determine the direction of recombination. Nonetheless, there

392

are several lines of evidence that support the direction having occurred from Lineage 5 to Lineage 1.

393

First, recombination is notoriously more frequent in spike compared to orf1ab [39,53,54]. Second,

394

Lineage 5 constitutes the base of the tree and has the oldest MRCA, meaning it likely shares more

395

ancestral traits with the MRCA of all sarbecoviruses. Third, phylogenetic topology in orf1ab before the

396

recombinant region of the genome mirrors that of S2 after the recombinant region (Figure 6A), orienting

397

orf1ab/S2 as sequence from the major parent of the recombination event. And finally, that spike is the

398

recombinant region as opposed to RdRp is also supported by numerous studies that have provided

399

evidence that SARS-CoV-1 is recombinant and SARS-CoV-2 is not [3,13,15,55].

400
401

In order for recombination to have occurred between Lineage 1 and Lineage 5, these viruses must have

402

had the opportunity to coinfect the same host cell. We demonstrate that recombination is possible given

403

that viruses related to SARS-CoV-1 and -2 appear to share both geographic and host space in

404

southwestern China and in R. sinicus and R. affinis bats. Highlighting that this previously known

405

recombination event (i.e. SARS-CoV-1) occurred with a previously unknown group of viruses that are

406

related to SARS-CoV-2 is an important finding of this study and demonstrates that recombination is an

407

important driver of spillover for sarbecoviruses.

408
409

A series of deletion events most likely resulted in the ancestral loss of ACE2 usage in Lineages 1-4

410

Using the RdRp tree as the evolutionary history to which to compare because of its stability and relative

411

lack of recombination, sequences without the deletions in the RBD most likely represent the ancestral

412

state, as the SARS-CoV-2 Lineage 5 viruses at the base of the tree do not show this trait (Figure 2). This

413

is in accordance with the findings of Boni et al. [39]. Alternatively, it is possible that the deletion state is

414

the ancestral state, and that this ancestral deletion state was conserved in Lineages 1, 2, and 3; however,

415

insertions acquired during the evolution of Lineages 4 and 5 would have had to have occurred

416

independently, which is less parsimonious. Persistence of the ACE2 usage trait from the MRCA of

417

Lineage 5 all the way to Lineage 1 is also not parsimonious, as the RBD deletions would have had to have

418

been lost many times independently (Figure 8).

419
420

Further, the viruses from bats in Africa and Europe have one of the two deletions, which may indicate that

421

these are descendant from an evolutionary intermediate and support a stepwise deletion hypothesis;

422

however, this hypothesis hinges completely on the uncertain positioning of Lineage 4 on the phylogeny,

423

which may support independent deletion within region 2 in Lineage 4 instead. Since ACE2-using Lineage

424

1 viruses including SARS-CoV-1 are nested within a clade of viruses that all have both deletions, this

425

implies that both deletions arose before the diversification of Lineages 1, 2, and 3 viruses (Figures 5 and

426

8). According to the branching order shown here, the smaller deletion in region 2 was likely acquired

427

earliest, before the diversification of the clades into Africa and Europe, since it is shared by all clades

428

with the exception of SARS-CoV-2 Lineage 5 at the base of the tree (Figure 5). These large deletions in

429

the RBD-ACE2 interface and the similarity of Rhinolophid and hACE2 also suggest that non-ACE2-

430

using viruses, including Lineages 1, 2, 3, and 4, are using at least one receptor other than ACE2 [8,36].

431
432

ACE2 usage is not well explained by convergent evolution

433

Under a hypothetical convergent evolution scenario, large insertions would have had to be reacquired in

434

precisely the same regions from which they were lost within the RBD independently in ACE2-using

435

Lineage 1 viruses. The most parsimonious argument is that ACE2-using Lineage 1 viruses are descendent

436

from at least two recombinant viruses (containing Types 1 and 2 RBDs) and that recombination best

437

explains the non-monophyletic pattern of ACE2 usage within the Sarbecovirus subgenus. In contrast,

438

human coronavirus NL63 is an alphacoronavirus that is also a hACE2 user but most likely represents a

439

true case of convergent evolution. The RBD of SARS-CoV-1 and SARS-CoV-2 are structurally identical,

440

while NL63 has a different structural fold, suggesting that they are not evolutionarily homologous [46].

441

Nonetheless, NL63 also binds to hACE2 in the same region – suggesting all of the ACE2-using viruses

442

have converged towards this interaction mode [46].

443
444

Additional evidence supports a recombination scenario over convergent evolution, including (i) the

445

detection of statistically supported recombination breakpoints in all ACE2-using Lineage 1 viruses

446

between RdRp and the RBD, and (ii) a growing number of reports identifying recombination in the spike

447

gene of other CoVs [22,56–59]. We also highlight an additional unreported recombination event between

448

Lineage 5 and Lineage 1 giving rise to RmYN02 that further demonstrates the importance of this

449

evolutionary mechanism. We observed that the Lineage 5 bat virus RmYN02, which is highly similar to

450

SARS-CoV-2 within the RdRp, actually has a RBD with the Lineage 1 deletion trait associated with the

451

inability to use ACE2. This indicates a recombination in the opposite direction, From Lineage 1 to

452

Lineage 5, and is again consistent with their overlapping host and geographic ranges. The RmYN02 virus

453

was sequenced from a pooled sample that also contained a second strain, RmYN01, so the possibility that

454

the assembled RmYN02 sequence is chimeric cannot be ruled out. However, both RmYN01 and

455

RmYN02 have deletions in the RBD, so whether or not the sequence is chimeric, it is most likely still

456

recombinant. Again, recombination is a much more parsimonious explanation for the loss of ACE2 usage

457

in RmYN02 rather than convergence, which would require independent and identical deletions in the

458

interfacial residues of the RBD.

459
460

Differences in receptor usage within sarbecoviruses would explain observed phylogeographic patterns

461

Lineage 1 and Lineage 5 viruses appear to occupy the same geographic space, which is necessary for the

462

opportunity to recombine to exist. However, the co-circulation of these distantly phylogenetically related

463

viruses is a notable deviation from previous observations that show sarbecovirus phylogeny mirrors

464

geography. It is unknown why Lineages 1-4 show strong phylogeographic clustering. Isolation by

465

distance (IBD) is one ecological mechanism that could explain concordance between phylogeny and

466

geography; however, this would not explain why Lineage 5 deviates from this pattern and overlaps

467

geographically with Lineage 1. Instead, we hypothesize that immune cross-reactivity between closely

468

related viruses within hosts results in indirect competitive exclusion and priority effects, and that this

469

explains the phylogeographic signal of Lineages 1-3. Antibodies against the spike protein are critical

470

components of the immune response against CoVs [60–62]. Hosts that have been infected by one

471

sarbecovirus may be immunologically resistant to infection from a related sarbecovirus, leading to

472

geographic exclusion of closely related strains and a pattern of evolution that is concordant with

473

geography despite the fact that species and individuals are not strictly confined (Figure 1). It is unlikely

474

that this pattern is caused by differing competencies amongst Rhinolophus bats, as host-switching of these

475

viruses appears to be common. The co-circulation of Lineage 5 viruses (including SARS-CoV-2 and

476

related viruses) in the same species and the same geographic location as Lineage 1 viruses may suggest a

477

release in the competitive interactions maintaining geographic specificity. This would preclude

478

recognition by cross-reactive antibodies, such as those produced against the spike protein, and may be

479

evolutionarily advantageous for the recombinant virus. Furthermore, if these two groups of viruses utilize

480

different receptors, antibodies against one would be ineffective at excluding the other, potentially

481

allowing both viral groups to infect the same hosts. If competitive release has indeed occurred among

482

these viruses, it is likely that the SARS-CoV-2 clade is potentially much more diverse and geographically

483

widespread than currently understood.

486

Here, we highlight the critical need for further surveillance specifically in southwestern China and

487

surrounding regions in southeast Asia given that all ACE2-using bat viruses discovered to date were

488

isolated from bats in Yunnan Province. If this holds true, it would support the hypothesis that SARS-

489

CoV-2 originated in Yunnan or the surrounding regions of southwest China before the initial epidemic

490

then amplified in Wuhan. Southeast Asia and parts of Europe and Africa have been previously identified

491

as hotspots for sarbecoviruses [63], but increased surveillance will help characterize the true range of

492

ACE2-using sarbecoviruses in particular. The receptors for viruses from northern China and other regions

493

such as Europe and Africa remain unknown, and may not pose a threat to human health if they cannot

494

utilize hACE2, though their potential to acquire hACE2-usage by recombination should be considered

495

along with the potential for their existing spike proteins to use other human receptors for cell entry. It is

496

unclear whether the lack of hACE2 binding for sarbecoviruses from Uganda and Rwanda is due to the

497

small deletion in region 2 or to the numerous amino acid changes in other interfacial residues. It is

498

possible that sarbecoviruses in Africa with different residues in these interfacial regions could potentially

499

still use hACE2. It is also unknown whether the sarbecoviruses from Africa in particular use a different

500

receptor altogether, or whether sarbecoviruses with the potential to utilize hACE2 without the region 2

501

deletion have also diversified into Africa or Europe. If competitive release between groups of viruses

502

utilizing different receptors has indeed occurred, further surveillance is needed to determine the true

503

extent of Lineage 5 viruses. In addition, experimental evidence to support or refute a competitive release

504

hypothesis should be prioritized.

505
506

This study highlights that hACE2 usage is unpredictable using phylogenetic proximity to SARS-CoV-1 or

507

SARS-CoV-2 in the RdRp gene. This is due to vastly different evolutionary histories in different parts of

508

the viral genome due to recombination. Phylogenetic relatedness in the RdRp gene is not an appropriate

509

proxy for pandemic potential among CoVs (the ‘nearest neighbor’ hypothesis). By extension, the

510

consensus PCR assays most commonly used for surveillance and discovery, which mostly generate a

511

small fragment of sequence from within this gene [64–66], are insufficient to predict hACE2 usage. Using

512

phylogenetic distance in RdRp as a quantitative metric to predict the potential for emergence is tempting

513

because of the large amount of data available, but this approach is unlikely to capture the biological

514

underpinnings of emergence potential compared to more robust data sources such as full viral genome

515

sequences. The current collection of full-length sarbecovirus genomes is heavily weighted toward China

516

and Rhinolophus hosts, despite evidence of sarbecoviruses prevalent outside of China (such as in Africa)

517

and in other mammalian hosts (such as pangolins). Further, investigations into determinants of

518

pathogenicity and transmission for CoVs and the genomic signatures of such features will be an important

519

step towards the prediction of viruses with spillover potential, and distinguishing those with pandemic

520

potential.

521
522

Finally, these findings reiterate the importance of recombination as a driver of spillover and emergence,

523

particularly in the spike gene. If SARS-CoV-1 gained the ability to use hACE2 through recombination,

524

other non-ACE2-using viruses could become human health threats through recombination as well. We

525

know that recombination occurs much more frequently than just this single event with SARS-CoV-1, as

526

the RdRp phylogeny does not mirror host phylogeny and the RBD tree has significantly different

527

topology across all geographic lineages. In addition, the bat virus RmYN02 appears to be recombinant in

528

the opposite direction (Lineage 5 backbone with Lineage 1 RBD) [36], again supporting the hypothesis

529

that recombination occurs between these lineages. Our analyses support two hypotheses: first, that

530

sarbecoviruses frequently undergo recombination in this region of the genome, resulting in this pattern,

531

and second, that sarbecoviruses are commonly shared amongst multiple host species, resulting in a lack of

532

concordance with host species phylogeny and a reasonable opportunity for coinfection and

533

recombination. Bats within the family Rhinolophidae have also repeatedly shown evidence of

534

introgression between species [67–72], supporting the hypothesis that many species in this family have

535

close contact with one another which may facilitate viral host switching. Given that we have shown that

536

ACE2-using viruses are co-occurring with a large diversity of non-ACE2-using viruses in Yunnan

537

Province and in a similar host landscape, recombination poses a significant threat to the emergence of

538

novel sarbecoviruses [7].

539
540

With recombination constituting such an important variable in the emergence of novel CoVs,

541

understanding the genetic and ecological determinants of this process is a critical avenue for future

542

research. Here we have shown not only that recombination was involved in the emergence of SARS-CoV-

543

1, but also demonstrated how knowledge of the evolutionary history of these viruses can be used to infer

544

the potential for other viruses to spillover and emerge. Understanding this evolutionary process is highly

545

dependent on factors influencing viral co-occurrence and recombination, such as the geographic range of

546

these viruses and their bat hosts, competitive interactions with co-circulating viruses within the same

547

hosts, and the range of host species these viruses are able to infect. Our understanding depends on the data

548

we have available - the importance of generating more data for such investigations cannot be understated.

549

Investing effort now into further sequencing these viruses and describing the mechanisms that underpin

550

their circulation and capacity for spillover will have important payoffs for predicting and preventing

551

sarbecovirus pandemics in the future.

552
553

Methods

554

Consensus PCR and sequencing of sarbecoviruses from Africa

555

Oral swabs, rectal swabs, whole blood, and urine samples collected from bats sampled and released in

556

Uganda and Rwanda were assayed for CoVs using consensus PCR as previously described [22]. All

557

sampling was conducted under UC Davis IACUC Protocol No. 16048. Bands of the expected size were

558

purified and confirmed positive by Sanger sequencing and the PCR fragments were deposited to GenBank

559

(accessions MT738926-MT738928, MT732776). Samples were subsequently deep sequenced using the

560

Illumina HiSeq platform and reads were bioinformatically de novo assembled using MEGAHIT v1.2.8

561

[73] after quality control steps and subtraction of host reads using Bowtie2 v2.3.5. Contigs were aligned

562

to a reference sequence and any overlaps or gaps were confirmed with iterative local alignment using

563

Bowtie2. The full genome sequences are deposited in GenBank. Cytochrome b, cytochrome oxidase I.

564

and ACE22 host sequences were also extracted bioinformatically where possible by mapping reads to

565

Rhinolophus ferrumequinum reference genes using Bowtie2 and deposited in GenBank.

566
567

Phylogenetic reconstruction

568

All publicly available full genome sarbecovirus sequences were collected from GenBank and SARS-

569

CoV-2, pangolin virus genomes, RaTG13, and RmYN01/RmYN02 were downloaded from GISAID

570

(Table 1). All relevant metadata (geographic origin, host species, date of collection) was retrieved from

571

GenBank or the corresponding publications. The RdRp gene (nucleotides 13,431 to 16,222 based on

572

SARS-CoV-2 sequence EPI_ISL_402125 from GISAID) and RBD region (nucleotides 22,506 to 23,174

573

based on the same SARS-CoV-2 reference genome) were extracted and aligned using Muscle v10.2.6.

574

We chose RdRp as a backbone to which to compare because of the strong evolutionary constraints

575

imposed by its fundamental biological role in viral replication [53]. Indeed, the RdRp is generally

576

considered to be a primary genetic trait in viral taxonomy [1,38] and most viruses exhibit strong purifying

577

selection in this gene [74]. Further, the orf1ab region of coronaviruses (which contains the RdRp) also

578

tends to be more recombination-free as compared to the recombination-frequent latter half of the genome

579

[39,54]. Since many of our conclusions are based around phylogenetic topology, we confirmed the

580

robustness of the topology of our nucleotide trees by also building identical trees with alignments of other

581

relatively stable genes in orf1ab frequently used for taxonomic classification [38] (Supplementary Figure

582

S1). Phylogenetic reconstruction was performed using BEAST v2.6.3 [75] with partitioned codon

583

positions, a GTR+Γ substitution model for each of the three codon positions, a constant size coalescent

584

process prior, and a strict molecular clock model. Log files were examined using Tracer v1.7.1 to confirm

585

that the model converged and that the effective sample size (ESS) for each parameter was at least 100.

586

Chains were run until these convergence criteria were met (~2-10 million samples) and multiple chains

587

were run independently to ensure convergence to the same estimates. Use of Beagle 2.1.2 was chosen to

588

increase computational speed.

589
590

Maximum clade credibility trees were built using TreeAnnotator and visualized with FigTree with

591

branches scaled by distance. Posterior probabilities are shown on the preceding branch for each node and

592

probabilities for nodes near the tips of the tree were removed for visual clarity as the exact reconstruction

593

of the most recent divergence events are not within the scope of this study and bear no impact on the

594

interpretation of evolutionary events deeper within the tree.

595
596

Finally, for time-calibrated phylogenies, we minimized the effect of recombination on our estimates by

597

using regions of the genome that were free of recombination for the 13 Lineage 1 sequences of interest

598

(further detailed below). In place of RdRp we used Region A, and in place of RBD we used Region E.

599

These regions were determined to be completely breakpoint free for all sequences using 3SEQ. We

600

started by adding tip dates to Region A and used a strict molecular clock with a normally distributed prior

601

informed from estimates derived in Boni et al. (mean 5.5e-4, sd 5.5e-5) [39]. The prior distribution for the

602

coalescent population size was set to lognormal with mean 1 and standard deviation 10 to help with

603

convergence, as the default of 1/X is an improper prior. Our phylogenetics and time estimates are in

604

accordance with those proposed by Boni et al [39]. As the substitution rate in the spike gene is

605

undoubtedly higher than in RdRp, the same clock rate prior could not be used for the Region E time-

606

calibrated phylogeny because the divergence dates would not be comparable. Instead, we assumed the age

607

of the root of this tree should be approximately the same as the age of the Region A tree and fixed the tree

608

height to match the posterior estimate of the tree height for Region A (770 years before present, 1250

609

AD). This was done by adding a monophyletic MRCA prior to all taxa with a Laplace distribution with

610

mu 1250 and scale 0.1. To account for lineage-specific substitution rates, we also tested a relaxed

611

lognormal clock model.

613

Screening for recombination using detection algorithms

614

We restricted our search for recombination breakpoints to the region of sequence beginning 750 base

615

pairs upstream from RdRp (SARS-CoV-2 nucleotide 12,681) through the end of S2 (through SARS-CoV-

616

2 nucleotide 25,176). There are undoubtedly other breakpoints outside of this region, but since our

617

analysis focuses primarily on RdRp and the spike, the recombination events elsewhere in the genome are

618

outside the scope of this study. We used the program 3SEQ [76] to test the 13 putative recombinants

619

within Lineage 1 (SARS-CoV-1, SARS-SZ3, LYRa11, Rs3367, WIV1, RsSHC014, Rs4084, YN2018B,

620

Rs7327, Rs9401, Rs4231, WIV16, Rs4874) and RmYN02 individually. If breakpoints were found, each

621

subregion on either side of the breakpoint was assessed separately to fine-tune our assessments until no

622

further breakpoints were identified. We did not test any of the remaining sequences for recombination.

623

We were able to identify six regions across all 13 recombinants that appear to be free of recombination

624

and chose these for further phylogenetic analysis (above). The topologies of regions A and E are not

625

significantly different from the topologies of RdRp and the RBD, respectively, suggesting that our use of

626

RdRp and RBD phylogenies in Figures 1, 2, and 5 is a sufficient representation despite some minor

627

evidence of recombination (e.g., LYRa11).

628
629

Cell culture and transfection

630

BHK and 293T cells were obtained from the American Type Culture Collection and maintained in

631

Dulbecco’s modified Eagle’s medium (DMEM; Sigma–Aldrich) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine

632

serum (FBS), penicillin/streptomycin and L-glutamine. BHK cells were seeded and transfected the next

633

day with 100ng of plasmid encoding hACE2 or an empty vector using polyethylenimine (Polysciences).

634

VSV plasmids were generated and transfected onto 293T cells to produce seed particles as previously

635

described [8]. CoV spike pseudotypes were generated as described in [77] and transfected onto 293T

636

cells. After 24h, cells were infected with VSV particles as described in [78], and after 1h of incubating at

637

37 °C, cells were washed three times and incubated in 2 ml DMEM supplemented with 2% FBS,

638

penicillin/streptomycin and L-glutamine for 48 h. Supernatants were collected and centrifuged at 500g for

639

5 min, then aliquoted and stored at −80 °C.

640
641

Western blots

642

293T cells transfected with CoV spike pseudotypes (producer cells) were lysed in 1% sodium dodecyl

643

sulfate, 150mM NaCl, 50 mM Tris-HCl and 5 mM EDTA and centrifuged at 14,000g for 20 minutes.

644

Pseudotyped particles were concentrated from producer cell supernatants that were overlaid on a 10%

645

OptiPrep cushion in PBS (Sigma–Aldrich) and centrifuged at 20,000g for 2h at 4 °C. Lysates and

646

concentrated particles were analyzed for FLAG (Sigma–Aldrich; A8592; 1:10,000), GAPDH (Sigma–

647

Aldrich; G8795; 1:10,000) and/or VSV-M (Kerafast; 23H12; 1:5,000) expression on 10% Bis-Tris PAGE

648

gel (Thermo Fisher Scientific).

649
650

Cell entry assays

651

Luciferase-based cell entry assays were performed as described in [8]. For each experiment, the relative

652

light unit for spike pseudotypes was normalized to the plate relative light unit average for the no-spike

653

control, and relative entry was calculated as the fold-entry over the negative control. Three replicates

654

were performed for each CoV pseudotype.

655
656

Structural modeling

657

RBDs were modeled using Modweb [79]. Modeled RBDs were docked to hACE2 by structural

658

superposition to the experimentally determined interaction complex between SARS-CoV-1 RBD and

659

hACE2 (PDB 2ajf) [41] using Chimera [80].

Table 2. Recombination breakpoints detected in ACE2-using Lineage 1 viruses by the program 3SEQ.

670

Each recombinant Lineage 1 virus was set as the child sequence, and the parental sequences between the

671

breakpoints identified (minor parent) and on either side (major parent) are listed. The p-value indicates

672

the level of significance indicated by 3SEQ. Breakpoint estimates are given as ranges, and the minimum

673

length of the recombinant region between these breakpoints is given. Numbering is relative to the

674

alignment, which begins at SARS-CoV-2 nucleotide 12,681. When 3SEQ identified more than one set of

675

breakpoint estimates, all were included in the table. Each recombinant region was further analyzed

676

separately for more breakpoints within, since 3SEQ identifies only one at a time.

682

Lineage 1 is shown in blue, Lineage 2 in green, and Lineage 3 in orange. The clade of viruses from Africa

683

and Europe is putatively named “Lineage 4” and is shown in purple. The phylogeny shows strong

684

posterior support for the branching order presented; however, different models or genes have produced

685

trees with different branching orders placing Lineage 4 outside Lineage 5, so the branch to Lineage 4 is

686

dashed to represent this uncertainty (Supplementary Figure S1). The putative “Lineage 5” containing

687

SARS-CoV-2 is also shown in blue at the bottom of the tree to demonstrate that the sequences are from

688

the same regions as Lineage 1 viruses. The geographic origin of each virus is indicated by the lines that

689

terminate in the respective country or province with the same color code. The full province and country

labeled sequence regions in Figure 5: region 1 in cyan, region 2 in orange, the receptor binding ridge in

729

purple, and region 3 in green. Labeled RBD residues correspond to interfacial residues whose identity

730

differ in African sarbecoviruses and SARS-CoV-1 or SARS-CoV-2 (labels are included in all four panels

731

to facilitate the identification of counterpart residues in each virus). Asterisks denote residues whose

732

identity is not shared by any ACE-2 binding SARS-CoV as dictated by Figure 5. Labeled hACE2 residues

733

correspond to residues within 5Å of RBD residues depicted.

Figure 5: The phylogenetic backbone of the RdRp gene alongside the amino acid sequences of the RBM.

736

Amino acid numbering is relative to SARS-CoV-1. Virus names in red font are known hACE2 users,

737

those in blue are known non-users, and those in black have not been tested. Residues within 10Å of the

738

interface with hACE2 are considered interfacial, and exact distances between each interfacial residue and

739

the closest hACE2 residue (based on structural modeling of SARS-CoV-1 bound with hACE2) are shown

740

along the bottom. Residues that are closer to the interface (3Å or less) and thus make strong interactions

741

with hACE2 are shown in red, and as distance increases this color transitions to purple, blue, and finally

742

to white. The receptor binding ridge sequences are highlighted in purple and the remaining interfacial

743

segments have been numbered regions 1, 2, and 3 for clarity within the main text. The colors of these

744

regions correspond with the colors in the structural models of Figure 4. The branch leading to Lineage 4

745

is dashed to demonstrate uncertainty in its positioning.

Figure 6. Recombination breakpoints detected in Lineage 1 ACE2-using sequences. The top of this figure

748

illustrates that the recombination suggested by the change in topology in Figure 2 for 13 Lineage 1

749

viruses is supported by formal breakpoint analysis. The breakpoints detected for each of the 13

750

recombinant Lineage 1 sequences with ACE2-using structure (no deletions) are shown. Sequences that

751

are nearly identical are colored the same for simplicity. The bars represent the sequence of genome

752

beginning 750 bp before RdRp spanning through the end of S2 (SARS-CoV-2 nucleotides 12,681 through

753

25,176) and each box within represents a recombinant section within the sequence. The breakpoints

754

correspond to those identified in Table 2. Numbering is relative to the alignment. The parental sequence is

755

shown within each box. Sequences identified as the minor parent by 3SEQ were labeled within the

756

breakpoint margins and the major parent outside. Six regions where these sequences appear to be free of

757

recombination are labeled A-F and a corresponding phylogeny for each region is shown below. Regions

758

A and E were further tested for recombination breakpoints in all sequences, not just the 13 Lineage 1

759

viruses, and were found to be breakpoint-free. The topology of regions A and E is not different enough

760

from Figure 2 to suggest that recombination within RdRp or RBD significantly changed the interpretation

761

of our results. For each region, sequences were tracked with connecting lines of corresponding color to

762

identify where recombination may have occurred between Lineage 1 and Lineage 5 and hypothesized

763

events are specifically marked with dotted lines. This highlights the secondary recombination of Rs4084

764

and RsSHC014 in region E on top of the primary recombination in regions B through E. Sequence names

765

of Lineage 2 and 3 viruses are greyed out and Lineages 4 and 5 are collapsed and highlighted in darker

766

grey to make the changes in topology between the trees more visible.

Figure 7. Time-calibrated phylogenies for recombination-free regions of the genome. Breakpoint-free

770

regions A and E from Figure 6 were chosen for time calibration since evidence of recombination was

771

found in both RdRp and RBD. Both regions A and E were free of recombination for all sequences

772

included in the tree, ensuring the best possible dating estimates. The MRCA of all Lineage 1

773

recombinants and its corresponding divergence date are labeled on each tree, demonstrating that the

774

MRCA in region E (within the RBD) is much older than the MRCA in region A (proxy for RdRp, see

775

Figure 6). This suggests that there would not have been enough time for the RBDs of the recombinants to

776

diversify to the extent shown here if only a single recombination event occurred between Lineage 5 and

777

Lineage 1. The MRCAs of each type are labeled in red (Type 1) and purple (Type 2). Posterior

778

distributions of rate estimates are also shown for each model as well as for a relaxed clock model of

779

region E. For the observed sequence divergence in region E to have accumulated since the MRCA of the

780

13 recombinants in region A (1852), a clock rate of 5.899e-3 would be required, which is well outside the

781

posterior distributions estimated by both our strict and relaxed clock models.

Figure 8. Proposed timeline of deletion and recombination events. The timeline demonstrates the

784

sequence of events that led to loss of ACE2 usage in Lineages 2, 3, and 4 and gain of ACE2 usage within

785

Lineage 1, leading to the emergence of SARS-CoV-1. Events are dated with MRCA age estimates;

786

however, the exact intention is less to provide exact dates and more to suggest a particular order of events,

787

which is strongly supported by the posterior probabilities of the time-calibrated phylogenies. The arrow

788

for the Lineage 4 event is again dashed to demonstrate uncertainty in its positioning. We illustrate two

789

hypotheses for the acquisition and subsequent spread of ACE2 usage in Lineage 1: recombination and

790

persistence. The recombination hypothesis is much more parsimonious, as persistence would require

791

multiple independent deletion events to generate the observed pattern of ACE2 usage.

Supplementary Figure S1. Phylogenetic trees of additional orf1ab genes used for taxonomic

993

classification. To investigate the robustness of the position of Lineage 4 in the RdRp phylogeny, we also

994

constructed phylogenies of nsp5 (3CLpro) and nsp13 (HEL1 core) using identical methods to those used

995

to generate Figure 1. While nsp5 supports the topology we observed for RdRp (nsp12), nsp13 supports

996

the positioning of Lineage 4 at the base of the tree instead. Because of the deep time scale and relatively

997

few sequences used to construct these trees, we must interpret hypotheses that depend on the branching

998

order with caution. The topology is robust to the inclusion or exclusion of the Hibecovirus sequence root

999

(data not shown). This pattern of inconsistency was also found for nsp14 and nsp15, with nsp14 matching

1000

the topology with Lineage 4 in an intermediate position and nsp15 matching the topology with Lineage 4

1001

at the base (data not shown). The roots of the trees were shortened for clarity.

Supplementary File 1. Excel spreadsheet of ACE2 amino acid alignment for host species of ACE2-using

1003

and non-ACE2-using viruses. Host ACE2 sequences involved in interfacial interactions with the RBD of

1004

SARS-CoV-1 and SARS-CoV-2 are shown for human, civet (Paguma larvata), pangolin (Manis

1005

javanica), and species of bats that are known to both harbor ACE2-binding and non-ACE2-binding

1006

viruses (Rhinolophus sinicus) or only non-ACE2-binding viruses (Rhinolophus macrotis, pearsonii,

1007

pusillus, ferrumequinum). The ACE2 sequence from the African bat species from which the PDF-2370

1008

sample was taken is unidentified and also shown. At the time of publication, the ACE2 sequence of

1009

Rhinolophus affinis was not available. GenBank accession numbers for each sequence are provided.

1010

Distance in angstroms to the nearest SARS-CoV-1 (row 14) or SARS-CoV-2 (row 15) residues are shown

1011

and color coded according to the legend in row 18. Residues in hosts of non-ACE2-binders that differ

1012

from hosts of ACE2-binders (human, civet, pangolin, and R. sinicus) are outlined with black boxes.
