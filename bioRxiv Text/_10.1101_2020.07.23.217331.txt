Abstract

26

Background

27

The novel coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) pandemic spread rapidly worldwide increasing

28

exponentially in Italy. To date, there is lack of studies describing clinical characteristics of the

29

population most at risk of infection. Hence, we aimed to identify clinical predictors of SARS-CoV-

30

2 infection risk and to develop and validate a score predicting SARS-CoV-2 infection risk

31

comparing it with unspecific surrogates.

32

Methods

33

Retrospective case/control study using administrative health-related database was carried

34

out in Southern Italy (Campania region) among beneficiaries of Regional Health Service aged over

35

than 30 years. For each subject with Covid-19 confirmed diagnosis (case), up to five controls were

36

randomly matched for gender, age and municipality of residence. Odds ratios and 90% confidence

37

intervals for associations between candidate predictors and risk of infection were estimated by

38

means of conditional logistic regression. SARS-CoV-2 Infection Score (SIS), was developed by

39

generating a total aggregate score obtained from assignment of a weight at each selected covariate

40

using coefficients estimated from the model. Finally, the score was categorized by assigning

41

increasing values from 1 to 4. SIS was validated by comparison with specific and unspecific

42

predictors of SARS-CoV-2 infection.

43

Results

44

Subjects suffering from diabetes, anaemias, Parkinson’s disease, mental disorders,

45

cardiovascular and inflammatory bowel and kidney diseases showed increased risk of SARS-CoV-

46

2 infection. Similar estimates were recorded for men and women and younger and older than 65

years. Fifteen conditions significantly contributed to the SIS. As SIS value increases, risk

48

progressively increases, being odds of SARS-CoV-2 infection among people with the highest SIS

49

value (SIS=4), 1.74 times higher than those unaffected by any SIS contributing conditions (SIS=1).

Conclusion

51

This study identified conditions and diseases making individuals more vulnerable to

52

SARS-CoV-2 infection. Our results are a decision-maker support tool for identifying population

53

most at risk allowing adoption of preventive measures to minimize a potential new relapse damage.

Introduction

57

Since December 2019, the novel coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) pandemic spread rapidly

58

from the Hubei province in China to 185 countries causing over 3,000,000 cases [1]. The epidemic

59

spread to and increased exponentially in Italy, earlier than in any other western Country, having

60

generated at the current time (June 15) over 236,000 confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infections [2].

61

Several hospital-based studies [3-7], including a systematic review of literature and meta-analysis

62

[8], focused around the attempt for predicting the progression of the disease towards developing

63

critical manifestations or death. These studies are important for the clinical practice point of view

64

for identifying patients at whom early treatment must be guaranteed. However, as the vast majority

65

of infections are not life-threatening [4], for the public health point of view it becomes increasingly

66

important stratifying population for identifying people at higher risk of infection. In spite of this,

67

at our best knowledge, no studies on this topic have been still published.

68

We therefore performed a large investigation based upon healthcare utilization database from the

69

Italian Region of Campania aimed (1) to identify clinical predictors of the risk of SARS-CoV-2

70

infection, (2) to develop and validate a score overall predicting the risk of SARS-CoV-2 infection,

71

and (3) to compare discriminant power of such a score with that from unspecific surrogates of

72

clinical profile.

73

Methods

74

Target population and data source

75

Resident in Campania who were beneficiaries of the Regional Health Service, and were aged

76

30 years or older, formed the target population (just almost 3.9 million people, around 9% of the

4

bioRxiv preprint doi: https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.07.23.217331; this version posted July 23, 2020. The copyright holder for this preprint

77

Italian population in that age group). Italian citizens have equal access to essential healthcare

78

services provided by the National Health Service. The present study was carried out using

79

information collected routinely in healthcare databases in Campania. The Campania Region

80

Database (CaReDB) includes information on patient demographics, the electronic records of

81

outpatient pharmacy dispensing and hospital discharges for ~6 million residents of a well-defined

82

population in Italy (~10% of the population of Italy). CaReDB is complete and includes validated

83

data in previous drug utilization studies [9-17]. The characteristics of CaReDB are described in S1

84

Table.

85

From the beginning of the Covid-19 epidemic, a surveillance system was implemented to collect

86

all cases identified by reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) testing for

87

SARS-CoV-2. Diagnostic algorithm was based on the protocol released by the World Health

88

Organization (WHO) [18], i.e., on nasopharyngeal swab specimens tested with at least two real-

89

time RT PCT assays targeting different genes (E, RdRp and M) of SARS-CoV-2.

90

These archives abovementioned can be linked together by a unique anonymous identifier that is

91

encrypted to protect patient privacy. Permission use anonymized data to this study was granted to

92

the researchers of the Centro di Ricerca in Farmacoeconomia e Farmacoutilizzazione (CIRFF) by

93

the governance board of Unità del Farmaco della Regione Campania. The research does not

94

contain clinical studies, and all patients’ data were fully anonymized and were analysed

95

retrospectively. For this type of study, formal consent is not required according to current national

96

law from Italian Medicines Agency and according to the Italian Data Protection Authority, neither

97

Ethical Committee approval nor informed consent were required for our study [19]. Our research

98

protocol adhered to the tenets of the Declaration of Helsinki 1975 and its later amendments.

99

Cases and controls

100

The date of Covid-19 infection diagnosis was considered as the index date and patients

101

were extracted from the registry until June 10, 2020. A total of 4,629 subjects positive to Covid-

102

19 were identified. Among these, we excluded i) patients with missing demographic information

103

(N=469) and ii) patients younger than 30 years at the index date (N=663). Finally, 3,497 patients

104

were included into the study as cases. Among them, 453 patients died during the observational

105

period.

106

For each case, up to five controls were randomly selected from the target population to be matched

107

for gender, age at index date and municipality of residence. The density incidence approach was

108

used for selecting controls since patients who had a confirmed diagnosis of Covid-19 infection

109

were eligible as potential controls until they became cases, and all matches had to be at risk of

110

Covid-19 infection.

111

Identifying clinical predictors of SARS-CoV-2 infection

112

A list of 47 diseases and conditions predictors of the risk of SARS-CoV-2 infection was

113

carefully chosen and assessed using a modified version of the RxRiskV Index. The latter is a

114

validated pharmaceutical-based comorbidity index derived from dispensation data using

115

Anatomical Therapeutic Chemical (ATC) classification codes [20,21]. The RxRiskV Index was

116

improved for our study to include updated ATC codes for medications licensed in Italy currently

117

and adding the pertaining ICD-9 CM code for each condition. These amendments were made

118

according to previously published works [22-29]. Individuals were classified as having one of the

119

conditions listed if they received at least ≥2 consecutive dispensations of a drug for treatment of a

6

120

specific class of disease and/or one hospital discharge with the diagnoses coded with the specific

121

ICD-9-CM (S2 Table).

122

Conditional logistic regression was used to estimate odds ratios (ORs), with 90% confidence

123

intervals (CIs), for the association between candidate predictors and the odds of SARS-CoV-2

124

infection. Predictors entered as dichotomous covariates into the model, i.e., with value 0 or 1

125

according to whether the specific condition was not or was recorded at least once within two-years

126

prior baseline (2018-2019). Unadjusted and mutually adjusted models were fitted by including one

127

by one covariate, and all covariates together, respectively. Power considerations suggested

128

excluding covariates with prevalence  0.12% among controls, i.e., predictors for which our

129

sample size was not sufficient for detecting OR of at least 3, with a 0.80 power, and by accepting

130

a 0.10 two-sided first type error. In addition, some conditions were grouped together when strong

131

uncertainty of algorithm did not allow for distinguishing them.

132

With the aim of testing the hypothesis that predictors may affect severity of clinical manifestations

133

of SARS-CoV-2 infection, rather than infection per se, analyses were restricted to strata having

134

fatal infection. Stratifications for sex and age categories (<65 years, ≥65 years) were performed as

135

secondary analyses.

136

Developing and validating a score to predict SARS-CoV-2 infection

137

Seven out of ten of the 3,497 1:5 case-control sets were randomly selected to form the so-

138

called training (derivation) set. The conditional logistic regression model was fitted to compute

139

the odds ratios as above described. The least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO)

140

method was applied for selecting the diseases / conditions able to independently predict the SARS-

141

CoV-2 infection [30]. The coefficients estimated from the model were used for assigning a weight

142

at each selected covariate. In particular, a weight was assigned to each coefficient by multiplying

143

it by 10 and rounding it to the nearest whole number [31]. The weights thus obtained were then

144

summed to generate a total aggregate score. To simplify the system, i.e., with the aim of accounting

145

for excessive heterogeneity of the total aggregate score, the latter was categorized by assigning

146

increasing values of 1, 2, 3 and 4 to the categories of the aggregate score of 0, 1-2, 3-4, ≥ 5,

147

respectively. The so obtained index was denoted SARS-CoV-2 Infection Score (SIS).

148

Performance of SIS was explored by applying the corresponding weights to the so-called

149

validation set consisting of the 1,048 1:5 case-control sets who did not enter into the training set.

150

To evaluate the clinical utility of SIS for predicting infection, we considered the receiver operating

151

characteristic (ROC) curve analysis and used area under the ROC curve (AUC) as a global

152

summary of the discriminatory capacity of the scores [32].

153

Comparing specific and unspecific predictors of SARS-CoV-2 infection

154

Some unspecific scores surrogating general clinical profile of each case and control

155

included into the study were considered. In particular, the number of drugs with different 3rd level

156

ATC dispensed to, and comorbidities with different ICD-9-CM experienced by each case and

157

control within two-years prior baseline (2018-2019) was recorded. Categorization was made by

158

assigning increasing values of 1, 2, 3 and 4 to 0, 1-4, 5-9 and ≥10 drugs (comedication score) and

159

1, 2, 3 and 4 to 0, 1-2 and ≥3 comorbidities (comorbidity score). In addition, cases and controls

160

were categorized according to the Multisource Comorbidity Score (MCS), a new index of patients’

161

clinical status derived from inpatients diagnostic information and outpatient drug prescriptions

162

provided by the regional Italian data and validated for outcome prediction [22,33]. To simplify

163

comparisons, the original five categories of worsening clinical profile (0, 1, 2, 3 and 4) as defined

164

by MCS, were reduced to milder (MCS=0), middle (1MCS3) and severe (MCS≥4) categories.

165

With the aim of comparing discriminatory ability of specific (SIS) and unspecific (comedications,

166

comorbidities and MCS) predictors of SARS-CoV-2 infection, ROC curves and corresponding

167

AUCs were again used.

168

All analyses were performed using SAS 9.4 (Cary, NC). A 2-sided p-value of 0.10 or less was

169

considered significant.

Table 1 reports univariate and multivariate association between the considered

173

diseases/conditions and the risk of Covid-19 infection. Owing to their low prevalence, fourteen

174

conditions were excluded from this analysis (tuberculosis, weight loss, disorders involving the

175

immune mechanisms, disorders of fluid, electrolyte and acid-base balance, coagulation defects,

176

bipolar disorders, alcohol abuse, drug addiction, multiple sclerosis, cystic fibrosis, chronic and

177

acute pancreatitis, anchylosing spondylitis, systemic sclerosis, systemic sclerosis). Among the 33

178

remaining conditions, two were grouped, i.e., chronic pulmonary obstructive disease with asthma

179

(chronic respiratory disease), and chronic renal disease with or without dialysis. Among the 31

180

remaining conditions, 23 (74%) and 12 (39%) showed significant association with the risk of

181

SARS-CoV-2 infection from univariate and multivariable regression respectively (Table 1).

182

In particular, patients suffering from diabetes, anaemias, mental disorders (dementia / Alzheimer’s

183

disease, psychosis and anxiety), Parkinson’s disease, glaucoma, diseases of the circulatory system

184

(heart failure and hypertension), chronic respiratory, inflammatory bowel, and rheumatologic

185

conditions showed statistical evidence of increased risk of infection with respect to patients who

186

did not suffer from them. Likely because of low power, only 7 conditions resulted significantly

associated with the risk of fatal Covid-19 disease, but there was no relevant difference in the

188

estimates with respect to the risk of SARS-CoV-2 infection as a whole (Table 1).

189

Same separate analysis was conducted for women and men positive to Covid-19, showing

190

statistical evidence of increased risk infection for women suffering from anaemias,

191

dementia/Alzheimer, psychosis, anxiety, epilepsy, hearth failure, kidney diseases and particularly

192

cystic fibrosis (S3 Table). Otherwise, higher risk of infection was observed among men suffering

193

from diabetes, psychosis, anxiety, Parkinson, arrhythmia, chronic pulmonary disease,

194

inflammatory bowel diseases and particularly dementia/Alzheimer and rheumatologic conditions.

195

Estimates were similar for Covid-19 patients younger and older than 65 years, showing, among

196

the first, significant higher risk of infection for diabetes, anxiety, Parkinson’s disease, arrhythmia,

197

inflammatory bowel and chronic pulmonary diseases, particularly dementia/Alzheimer (S4 Table).

198

While, patients older than 65 years suffering from thyroid disorders, anaemias,

199

dementia/Alzheimer, psychosis, anxiety, epilepsy and hearth failure showed significant higher risk

SARS-CoV-2 Infection Score (SIS)
Fifteen conditions significantly contributed to the SIS, the corresponding weights being
reported in Table 2. Factors which most contributed to the total aggregate score were dementia /
Alzheimer’s disease, kidney disease, psychosis, inflammatory bowel disease and rheumatologic
conditions, while diabetes, anaemias, anxiety, Parkinson’s disease, glaucoma, heart failure,
hypertension, arrhythmia, thyroid disorders and chronic respiratory disease provided small,
although significant, contributions. Fig 1 shows that, as the SIS value increases, the OR
progressively increases, being the odds of SARS-CoV-2 infection among people with the highest
SIS value (SIS = IV), 1.74 times higher than those unaffected by any SIS contributing conditions
(SIS = I). The prevalence of controls stratified according to the SIS score gradually decreases from
50% (SIS = I) to 12% (SIS = IV).

Comparing with unspecific predictors of SARS-CoV-2 infection
Generic/unspecific scores surrogating clinical profile showed to be associated with the risk
of SARS-CoV-2 infection, showing patients with ≥ 10 drug treatments, those with ≥ 3
comorbidities, and those with MCS value ≥ 4, increased risk of 65%, 36% and 45% with respect
to patients cotreatments, comorbidities and MCS value = I, respectively (Table 3).
AUC (90% CI) of SIS, cotreatment and comorbidity scores and MCS respectively had values of
0.54 (0.52 to 0.56), 0.52 (0.50 to 0.54), 0.53 (0.51 to 0.55), and 0.53 (0.51 to 0.55) (Fig 2). There
was no evidence that specific and unspecific scores had different discriminatory ability.

Discussion
Our study shows that several diseases and conditions are significantly and independently
associated with the risk of SARS-CoV-2 infection. Beyond conditions making particularly
vulnerable the respiratory system (e.g., chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and asthma),
comorbidities including practically all diagnostic categories are involved. Predictors belonging to
nutritional and metabolic (diabetes), cardiovascular (heart failure and hypertension) and renal
diseases were widely expected, since it has accepted that SARS-CoV-2 has major implications for
the cardiovascular system. Indeed, patients with heart failure [34], diabetes [35-37], hypertension

[38] and kidney disease [39-41] have been consistently identified as particularly vulnerable
populations, and these findings were consistently found in our study. In addition, we confirmed
that people with weakened immune systems from a medical condition or treatment are at a higher
risk. Among these, those living with haemoglobin disorders [42], inflammatory bowel disease [43]
and immune-rheumatological diseases [44] must be considered vulnerable groups for Covid-19
infection. Mental health and cognitive function might have independent utility in understanding
the burden of respiratory disease, since they may influence the risk of contracting the infection, at
least in part by impairing innate or adaptive immunity [45] and diminishing the precautions taken
to minimize risk. Another explanation of our findings is that people with history of depression
[46], psychosis [47] and stress disorders [48] could experience elevated rates of an array of
respiratory infections because these conditions often require treatment in a psychiatric care facility,
and the risk of infection can be particularly high in these structures. Finally, our study adds
evidence regarding the impact of diseases and conditions on the risk of SARS-CoV-2 infection
between men and women. As pointed out by a recent study [49], sex and age disaggregated data
are essential for understanding the distributions of risk infection in the population and the extent
to which they affect clinical outcomes.
Despite our results confirm that a wide range of diseases and conditions likely increase
vulnerability to SARS-CoV-2 infection, and probably its more severe clinical manifestations, we
have not been able to develop a score that accurately may predict the risk of infection. In addition,
we found that predictive ability of the score obtained by weighting risk factors of SARS-CoV-2
infection, was not better than generic scores of comorbidity and comedication. This expands upon
previous findings of individual comorbidities as independent risk factors for SARS-CoV-2
infection [50,51], and confirms our substantial inability to predict the risk of SARS-CoV-2
infection. The reasons are likely linked with the several limitations of our approach that, in general,

generates estimates biased towards the null. First, exposure misclassification regards our inability
to careful capturing conditions and diseases through algorithms based on healthcare utilization
databases [52]. Second, it is well known that outcome misclassification can bias epidemiologic
results. For Covid-19, suboptimal test sensitivity, despite excellent specificity, results in an
overestimation of cases in the early stages of an outbreak, and substantial underestimation of cases
as prevalence increases [53]. It should be noticed, however, that both, exposure and outcome
misclassification likely drew estimates towards the null (i.e., underestimate the strength of the
association between their presence and the outcome risk) so generating uncertainty for the
weighting approach of score developing. Third, the lack of specific data regarding the clinical
outcome for the stratification of Covid-19 positive patients in terms of home isolation,
hospitalization and admission in intensive care. Fourth, the lack of information on biologic
markers potentially able to predict infection, and severity of its clinical manifestations, is another
limitation of our study, as for example, according to the current literature, some laboratory
hallmarks have been shown to predict infection, particularly in more severe cases [54]. Finally,
our choice of accepting a 0.10 first type error, and of consequently reporting 90% confidence
intervals, is justified by the exploratory nature of our study, but at the same time likely generate
false positive signals, so limiting discriminant power of the score.
In conclusion, taking the limitations we discussed into account, we identified conditions and
diseases that make people more vulnerable to SARS-CoV-2 infection. These findings contribute
to inform public health, and clinical decisions regarding risk stratifying. However, further research
is need for developing a score reliably predicting the risk, possibly by integrating healthcare
utilization with clinical and biological data.

Our results can be an important tool supporting all clinical and political stakeholders allowing the
identification of the population most at risk of contracting Covid-19 and facilitating the provision
of appropriate preventive/therapeutic measures, especially with the hypothetic prediction of a new
autumn outbreak. Adopting preventive measures can help to minimize the damage generated by a
potential new relapse that the health systems will face.
