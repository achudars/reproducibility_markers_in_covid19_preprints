Abstract

Anti-viral activities of long-chain inorganic polyphosphates (PolyPs) against severe acute
respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV)-2 infection were investigated. In molecular
docking analyses, PolyPs interacted with several conserved angiotensin-converting enzyme
(ACE)2 and RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp) amino acids. We thus tested PolyPs
for functional interactions in vitro in SARS-CoV-2–infected Vero E6, Caco2 and human
primary nasal epithelial cells. Immunofluorescence, qPCR, direct RNA sequencing, FISH and
Immunoblotting were used to determine virus loads and transcription levels of
genomic(g)RNAs and sub-genomic(sg)RNAs. We show that PolyP120 binds to ACE2 and
enhances its proteasomal degradation. PolyP120 shows steric hindrance of the genomic SarsCoV-2-RNA/RdRP complex, to impair synthesis of positive-sense gRNAs, viral subgenomic
transcripts and structural proteins needed for viral replication. Thus, PolyP120 impairs
infection and replication of Korean and European (containing non-synonymous variants)
SARS-CoV-2 strains. As PolyPs have no toxic activities, we envision their use as a nebulised
formula for oropharyngeal delivery to prevent infections of SARS-CoV-2 and during early
phases of antiviral therapy.

Introduction

Coronaviruses (CoVs) contain positive-sense, single-stranded RNA (~30 kb). Four major
categories have been reported, with alphaCoV and betaCoV known to infect humans. Those
that can replicate in the lower respiratory tract cause pneumonia, which can be fatal (1),(2),
and these include severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS)-CoV, Middle East respiratory
syndrome (MERS)-CoV, and the new SARS-CoV-2. This last CoV belongs to the betaCoV
genus (3) and has resulted in pandemic acute respiratory syndrome in humans (i.e., COVID19 disease). This can progress to acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), generally
around 8 to 9 days after symptom onset (4). Like the other respiratory CoVs, SARS-CoV-2 is
transmitted via respiratory droplets, with possible faecal–oral transmission (5).
When SARS-CoV-2 infects host cells, it replicates its genomic (g)RNA to produce
smaller RNAs known as subgenomic (sg)RNAs, mostly used to synthesise conserved
structural viral proteins Spike (S), Envelope (E), Membrane (M) and Nucleocapsid (N) (6).
The receptor used by SARS-CoV-2 to enter host cells is angiotensin-converting
enzyme 2 (ACE2), which is mainly expressed in the lungs (7),(8), together with the cellular
serine protease TMPRSS2 (9).
The SARS-CoV-2 RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp; also, non-structural
protein [nsp]12) is a key component of the viral replication/ transcription machinery and
contributes to viral genome mutation, and hence to viral adaptation. RdRp is part of a
complex machinery (i.e., RdRp/nsp7/nsp8) that is fundamental to transcriptional fidelity
(proofreading) (2). RdRp thus coordinates the replication of both the viral genome (which is
used as the template for replication and transcription) and the shorter sgRNAs, according to
the prevailing “leader-to-body” fusion model (10). Of importance, RdRp mutations at position

14,408 in European strains of SARS-CoV-2 suggest that the proofreading activity has been
affected, thus altering their mutation rates (11).
Due to the dramatic global spread of COVID-19 and its associated high mortality rate,
development of novel therapeutic strategies represents an unmet medical need. We therefore
investigated the potential activities of long-chain inorganic polyphosphates (PolyPs) against
SARS-CoV-2 viral infection.
The PolyPs are comprised of chains of a few to many hundreds of inorganic
phosphates (Pi). They are ubiquitous, with prevalence in peripheral blood mononuclear cells
and erythrocytes (12), and subcellularly in the nucleus, cytoplasm, plasma membranes and
mitochondria (13). PolyPs are involved in of blood coagulation through activation of factor
XII (14) and inhibition of the complement terminal coagulation pathway (15). Furthermore,
they are involved in chelation of calcium for bone mineralisation (16) and activation of
apoptosis (12). Furthermore, they act as ‘chaperone-like’ (17), and neuronal excitability
molecules (18),(19),(20). Of importance, linear PolyPs have been reported to have
cytoprotective and antiviral activities against human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1)
infection in vitro (21).
We show here that long-chain inorganic PolyPs have anti-viral activities against
SARS-CoV-2 in different cellular models (i.e., Vero E6, Caco2 and human primary nasal
epithelial cells). We demonstrate that intracellularly, PolyPs enhance proteasome-mediated
ACE2 down-regulation, and impair transcriptional activity of RpRd during its synthesis of the
major structural sgRNAs and proteins (i.e., S, E, M, N). As PolyPs are already known not to
be toxic, these data open the door to clinical trials with PolyPs in humans.

Anti-viral effects against SARS-CoV-2 of ‘preventive treatments’ with long-chain
PolyPs
Anti-viral activity of linear PolyPs with average chain lengths of 15, 34, 91 Pi residues has
been previously shown on HIV-infected cells (21).
To investigate potential cytoprotective effects of long-chain PolyPs, PolyP120 was
used here, initially with epithelial cells derived from an African green monkey kidney (i.e.,
Vero E6 cells; ATCC CRL-1586), because of their high expression of ACE2 (22). The Vero
cells were first incubated with 37.5 μM PolyP120, and after 30 min they were infected with
SARS-CoV-2 viral particles (multiplicity of infection [MOI], 0.01) obtained from a swab of
an Italian patient affected by COVID-19 (Fig. S1A; viral sequence shown in Fig. S1B).
Following treatment of these cells with PolyP120, there were significantly decreased
expression levels of the viral N gene (as fragments N1-3) 12 h after viral infection, compared
to the vehicle control (Fig. S1C). Moreover, quantitative immunofluorescence of the same
PolyP120-pretreated cells show reduced levels of the SARS-CoV-2 S-, E- and N-proteins
(Fig. S1D and E). However, the RdRp protein was not down-regulated here (Fig. S1D and
E). These data suggest that the anti-viral activity of PolyP120 can be ascribed to reduced
SARS-CoV-2 entry into host cells (which is mainly mediated by ACE2), and/or inhibition of
RdRp transcriptional activity.

Anti-viral effects of PolyP120 are mediated by ACE2 down-regulation, with no cytotoxic
effects
To address these hypotheses, potential binding sites for PolyP120 on both ACE2 and the viral
RdRP proteins were investigated through molecular docking. These data showed the potential
for binding between ACE2 and short-chain PolyPs (e.g., PolyP20), which was mostly
mediated by four ACE2 amino-acid residues (Arg514, His401, His378 and Arg393; Fig. 1A

and Table 1) that are conserved across different vertebrates (sequence identity, 63.6%; Fig.
1A).
The colocalisation between PolyPs and ACE2 in Vero cells was then examined. For
this, the Vero cells were treated with a short-chain PolyP (i.e., PolyP8) conjugated with a
fluorescent dye (i.e., 4-methylumbelliferone; MU). The immunofluorescence indicated
colocalisation between PolyP8-MU and ACE2 in these treated cells (Fig. 1B, Fig. S2A and
B). Furthermore, we investigated whether the long-chain PolyP120 colocalised with ACE2.
Here, a DAPI-based approach was used to label PolyP120 (as previously described (23)), with
colocalisation also seen between the intracellular PolyP120 and ACE2 (Fig. S2C) in these
Vero cells. This was thus indicative of an interaction between PolyPs and ACE2.
As a ‘scaffold-like’ activity has been previously described for PolyPs (17), we
investigated whether ACE2 protein expression can be modulated by PolyPs. Due to the high
ACE2 expression levels in nasal epithelial cells (24), we used human primary cells obtained
from nasal brushings of healthy subjects (Fig. S2D). These were treated with increasing
concentrations of PolyP120. Immunoblotting demonstrated a dose-dependent reduction in
ACE2 protein levels in these cells after 24 h treatments with PolyP120 (4.2-112 μM) (Fig.
1C). In Vero cells, the addition of 37.5 μM PolyP120 also showed a time-dependent ACE2
down-regulation (Fig. 1D). Of interest, the decrease in ACE2 protein levels was dependent on
the number of phosphates in the PolyPs (Fig. 1E). Thus, to reduce the levels of ACE2 in Vero
cells, they needed to be treated with PolyPs with >8 phosphate residues. Furthermore, longchain PolyPs treatment showed greater accumulation of ACE2 upon addition of the
proteasome inhibitor MG-132, compared to the vehicle controls (Fig. 1F), thus suggesting
that the PolyPs-mediated downregulation of ACE2 occurs via proteasome. To further validate
that PolyPs affect the ubiquitin–proteasome system, PolyP120 was shown not only to increase
the levels of ACE2 in presence of MG-132 (Fig. 1G) but also to reduce its levels upon

addition of the protein synthesis inhibitor cycloheximide (Fig. 1H). These data are further
confirmed using transfection of an HA-ubiquitin plasmid construct in HEK293 cells (Fig. 1I,
Fig. S2E).
Altogether, these data indicate that PolyP120 can bind to ACE2 and enhance its
proteasome-dependent degradation, thus indicating its anti-viral mechanism of action. Of
importance, the potential cytotoxicity of PolyPs were also evaluated when administered at
different doses to the human primary cells, using ‘real-time’ cell proliferation assays (i.e., cell
index). These data showed that only the highest dose of 112 μM PolyP120 had cytotoxic
effects, as seen by decreased cell proliferation rate (Fig. S2F). However, Caspase 3 enzymatic
assays did not show activation of the apoptotic cascade by PolyP120 (Fig. S2G), thus further
confirming the lack of toxic effects of PolyP120.

PolyP120 inhibits transcription of viral sgRNAs through inhibition of RdRp
To gain further insight into the anti-viral mechanisms of PolyPs in their inhibition of viral
gene transcription, we investigated potential interactions with RdRp. Molecular docking
analysis showed putative binding sites for PolyP15 on the RdRp protein (Fig. S3A and Table
1). Further docking studies performed with RdRp in its active replicating form (i.e.,
RdRp/nsp7/nsp8 complex; Table 1) illustrated possible binding modes with PolyP20. These
are mediated through seven RdRp amino-acid residues located within the RNA-binding site
of RdRp (K4892, K4937, R4945, D5152, R5228, D5237, and K5241; Fig. 2A) that are
conserved in RdRp of other viruses in the Coronoviridae family (e.g., SARS-CoV, MERSCoV; Fig. 2A), and potentially in the main families of positive-sense single-stranded RNA
viruses from other hosts (e.g., Nidovirales; as listed at https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/genomes/
GenomesGroup.cgi?taxid=76804).

Using immunofluorescence, colocalisation between PolyP8-MU and RdRP was
indicated for Vero cells transfected with a FLAG-RdRp plasmid construct (Fig. 1B and Fig.
S3B and C, on left panel). Moreover, immunofluorescence of SARS-CoV-2-infected Vero
cells showed colocalisation between intracellular PolyP120 and RdRp protein (Fig. S3C on
right panel), thus indicating the potential for interactions.
Whether the downregulation of the viral genes mediated by PolyPs was due to
inhibition of the viral transcription process was also investigated. Thus, we used total RNA
samples from oropharyngeal swabs of eight Italian patients with COVID-19 (Table 2) and
examined modulation of amplification of the viral N1-3 gene fragments in the presence of
PolyP120 (Fig. S3D). These data showed increase in Ct values for both N1 and N3, and a
total inhibition of the N2 gene fragment (i.e., undetermined Ct) when the reactions were
performed in presence of 37.5 μM PolyP120 (Fig. S3E). Of interest, addition of PolyP120 did
not alter amplification of the N gene fragments when external S RNA controls (N1/2/3-O2methyl) were used (Fig. S3F). These in-vitro data indicated that PolyP120 requires the host
proteins and/or carriers for inhibition of viral gene transcription.
Then, to further dissect out transcriptional inhibition mediated by PolyP120 on RdRp,
we focused on its discontinuous transcription, taking into account four structural sgRNAs
(i.e., sgS, sgE, sgM, sgN). For this purpose, SARS-CoV-2-infected Vero cells were treated
with PolyP120 and then analysed for transcription of these sgRNAs (Fig. S4A). These data
confirmed a reduction in the N gene fragments, RdRp and S transcripts in PolyP120-treated
cells (Fig. S4B and C). Additional data were obtained using Nanopore technology and direct
RNA sequencing of the RNAs extracted from viral infection of these Vero cells showing
decreased levels of the sgRNAs (Fig. 2C and Table S2; see Methods and CEINGE portal).
Furthermore, using RT-PCR with SYBR-Green, we also confirmed these data showing
decreased levels of sgS, sgE, sgM and sgN (Fig. 2D). Moreover, immunoblotting performed

with PolyP120-treated SARS-CoV-2–infected Vero cells also showed dramatic reductions in
both ACE2 and N-protein levels (Fig. S4D).
This ‘therapeutic’ anti-viral action of PolyP120 was also confirmed by
immunofluorescence, which showed significant reduction of ACE2 and the SARS-CoV-2
proteins (i.e., N, E, S) in these PolyP120-treated Vero cells (Fig. 2E, Fig. S4E and F, and
Fig. S5). Furthermore, through Hulu-FISH in situ hybridization approach combined to
quantitative Immunofluorescence we also detect a reduction of gRNA-Spike and ACE2
protein in SARS-CoV-2-infected Vero cells upon addition of PolyP120 (see Fig. 4A).
Altogether, these data show the mechanisms of action of the PolyPs through reduction in the
transcriptional activity of RdRp, which appears to be due to their binding to its active
enzymatic core (see Fig. 2A).
Of interest, we also noted down-regulation of ACE2 at the transcriptional level (Fig.
S4C). Treatment with the transcriptional inhibitor actinomycin D showed significant decrease
in ACE2 mRNA expression levels in the Vero cells after 24 h (Fig. S4G), thus also
suggesting transcriptional inhibition mediated by PolyPs.

Therapeutic treatments with long-chain PolyPs
To investigate the potential ‘therapeutic’ effectiveness of PolyPs, additional studies were
performed in which PolyPs at different chain length were added after SARS-CoV-2 infection.
For this purpose, SARS-CoV-2–infected Vero cells were incubated with PolyPs (starting
from the 120 phosphate residues of PolyP120, and including PolyP126 and PolyP189), and
then analysed for expression levels of the viral N gene (Fig. S6A). No significant differences
were seen between these different chain length PolyPs for the decreased expression of the
viral N gene (N1-3), compared to the vehicle control (Fig. S6B).

Furthermore, similar data were obtained for Vero cells infected with SARS-CoV-2
particles obtained from a Korean patient (EPI_ISL_407193; Fig. S1B), by measuring viral
RdRp and E genes expression upon addition of PolyP120 at different concentrations (9.38,
18.75, 37.50 μΜ) (Fig. S6C and D). The increased Ct values for the RdRp gene in these Vero
cells treated with PolyP120 indicated inhibition of SARS-CoV-2 infection, including for the
lowest PolyP120 concentration used (Fig. S6D).
As different mutations have been identified in Europe for the RdRp, S and ORF1ab
genes (11), we also performed sequencing analysis focusing on the viral regions that flank
these hot-spot mutation sites between the Italian and Korean SARS-CoV-2. These data
showed non-synonymous variants in these genes (i.e., RdRp, S, ORF1ab) in the viral genome
from an Italian patient compared to that from the Korean patient (Fig. S2A, red arrows).
Furthermore, these variants were conserved across Italian viral sequences, compared to Asian
viral sequences (Fig. S2A), as previously described (25). Importantly, the mutation in RdRp
(at position 14408) was associated with an increased mutation rate, which would appear to be
due to an alteration in the proofreading that is finely regulated by the RdRp/nsp7/nsp8
machinery complex (11). Our data show that PolyP120 can decrease the expression of these
viral genes in the infected Vero cells also in the presence of this SARS-CoV-2 point mutation.
In this regard, our docking analysis suggested that the mutated site in RdRp falls outside of its
RNA-dependent transcriptional activity domain and its potential binding sites with the PolyPs
(Fig. S6E). This thus supports the hypothesis that the PolyPs impair the RNA-dependent
transcriptional activity rather than the proofreading activity.

To determine further whether increased PolyPs size, in terms of Pi residues, has any effects
on their antiviral activity, human primary cells were pretreated with PolyP120 and PolyP126,
then infected with SARS-CoV-2 at the different viral loads of 0.01 and 0.16 MOI, and
analysed for expression levels of the viral N gene (Fig. S7A). These data indicated that
PolyP126 shows similar anti-viral activity to PolyP120 in these human cells infected with
SARS-CoV-2 (Fig. S7B). Altogether, these data suggest that following the pretreatment of
human primary nasal epithelial cells, the longer-chain PolyPs (e.g., PolyP120, PolyP126)
have anti-viral effects through inhibition of N gene transcription. This preventive antiviral
action was also confirmed in SARS-CoV-2–infected human colorectal carcinoma cells (i.e.,
Caco2 cells), where PolyP120 pre-treatment showed a decrease for the viral genes (N, RdRp)
(Fig. S7C to E) and ACE2 protein (Fig. S7F). These data thus suggest that the mechanism of
action of PolyP120 is conserved across different human cellular models.
Furthermore, we also tested the ‘therapeutic’ effectiveness of PolyP120 in SARSCoV-2–infected human primary nasal epithelial cells (Fig. 3A, Fig. S8A). The PolyP120
treatment showed decreased levels of the N1-3 gene fragments (Fig. S8B), and reductions in
the other viral genes (i.e., RdRp, S, E) and ACE2 (Fig. S8C). Furthermore, immunoblotting
confirmed total inhibition of the ACE2 and N protein levels in these treated human primary
nasal epithelial cells (Fig. 3B).
Patients with COVID-19 also show increased circulating levels of inflammatory
cytokines, including interferon-γ and interleukin (IL)-6, IL-10 and IL-12 (26). As the PolyPs
have been previously described as having anti-inflammatory functions (14), we investigated
the potential modulation by PolyP120 of these cytokines in human primary cells infected with
SARS-CoV-2. Indeed, real-time PCR analyses showed significant reductions in interferon-γ,
IL-6, IL-10 IL-12 and tumour necrosis factor-α (Fig. 3c). The anti-inflammatory action
exerted by PolyPs could be ascribed to the inhibition of NF-kB pathway, as shown by reduced

levels of phosphorylated (Ser311)-p65 in SARS-CoV-2-infected Vero cells after treatment
with PolyP120 (Fig. 3D).
As the PolyPs have been previously reported to be associated with the inflammatory
pathways that are mainly regulated by NF-κB (27) and mTOR (28), we hypothesise that this
down-regulation of the cytokines can be ascribed to modulation of the inflammatory cascades
in an autocrine and paracrine manner by PolyP120.

Delivery of PolyP120 through a nonambulatory nebuliser system
Due to the respiratory failure experienced by patients with COVID-19, new drug formulations
that are appropriate for aerosol inhalation, and thus more direct lung delivery, represent an
unmet medical need. For this reason, we tested the delivery of PolyP120 into Vero cells via a
nebuliser system. Here, 37.5 μM PolyP120 was nebulised for 2 min (condensation rate, 1
mL/min) into the tissue culture flask containing the attached Vero cells in the absence of
medium. After nebulising, medium was added back to the cells, and the flasks were left for 12
h under growth conditions (see Video 1, Supplemental Material). Entrance of the PolyP120
into the cells was confirmed by immunofluorescence using DAPI, thus showing the efficacy
of this delivery for the nebulised PolyP120 into the cells (Fig. S8D).
We then investigated whether this PolyP120 aerosol formulation maintains the
antiviral activity of PolyP120 on Vero cells. Thus, the nebulised PolyP120 was similarly
applied to Vero cells that were then infected with SARS-CoV-2 viral particles (Fig. S8E).
Real-time PCR analysis indeed showed down-regulation of the N gene fragments and reduced
levels of ACE 2 and the viral genes, and all of the structural sgRNAs (Fig. 3E). This thus
indicated that PolyP120 delivered in this aerosol formulation maintained its anti-viral action
against SARS-CoV-2 infection.

Conclusions

Here, we have shown that long chain length PolyPs (i.e., PolyP120, with 120 phosphate
residues) can inhibit the transcription of SARS-CoV-2 viral genes (Fig. 4A) impairing the
replication of the virus in the host cell. Future diagnostic use of this technology in vivo will be
of great impact monitoring the disease status.
Of importance, we have described two intracellular mechanisms of action behind this
anti-viral function of PolyPs, as summarised in Fig. 4B. The first mechanism involves timeand dose-dependent proteasome-mediated degradation of ACE2 protein in the presence of
long chain length PolyPs. This appears to be due to the binding of the PolyPs to ACE2, which
should be mainly mediated by four amino-acid residues of ACE2 that are also conserved
across different species: Arg514, His 401, His 378 and Arg393. This is of importance to avoid
further spillover. We also note the role of PolyPs as a source of Pi to increase the pool of ATP
available to enhance the ubiquitin–proteasome system (29).
Interestingly, we have also shown that the SARS-CoV-2–infected cells have reduced
ACE mRNA expression levels after treatment with PolyP120, we think this is because the
expression of ACE2 is regulated by the HNF1α transcriptional factor (30) and epigenetically
by SIRT1 (31). These phenomena need further investigations.
Of note, in directing any treatment here at ACE2 as the receptor for SARS-CoV-2
entry into cells, the use of ACE inhibitors has been discouraged for patients with COVID-19.
This is because of the consequent increased levels of ACE2 mRNA, which might facilitate
engagement and entry of SARS-CoV-2 into cells (32). However, the future use of PolyPs
might indeed overcome this side effect of the use of ACE inhibitors. Thus, the combination of
ACE inhibitors with PolyPs can be postulated for the treatment of patients with COVID-19.

The second mechanism of action presented here involves transcriptional inhibition of
RdRP (Fig. 4B). The PolyPs appear to bind to viral RdRp from SARS-CoV-2, mainly through
seven of its amino-acid residues located within the RdRp RNA-binding site. PolyP120
appears to decrease the expression of the main SARS-CoV-2 viral genes through this
mechanism. Of importance, the transcription of the main viral sgRNAs is also impaired
confirming their inhibitory actions on RdRp transcription. This inhibition also occurs in the
presence of non-synonymous variants (at position 14408) that have been shown to affect the
integrity of the proofreading activity, which further supports the importance of PolyPs to
universally impair viral gene transcription. The amino-acid residues in RdRp that are
potentially involved in the binding with PolyPs have also been conserved through evolution in
different species, and thus they might also be conserved in the other positive-sense singlestranded

open the way for the potential use of PolyPs against other viral infections.
The various concentrations of PolyP120 tested here are also shown not to have any
toxic effects, as seen by monitoring of the caspase 3 enzymatic activation in human primary
nasal epithelial cells. However, the highest concentration of PolyP120 tested (i.e., 112 μM)
blocked proliferation of these primary cells. This anti-proliferative effect might be due to the
inhibition of the MAP-kinase cascade (via ERK), which has previously been reported for
inorganic PolyPs (33).
PolyPs have also been shown to be key modulators of inflammatory pathways, with
actions mainly via the NF-κB cascade (27). Here, we have shown that PolyP120 decreases the
levels of the main cytokines (i.e., interferon-γ, IL-6, IL-10, IL-12) that are part of the cytokine
storm often seen for patients with COVID-19 (26) by affecting NF-kB cascade. Among these
cytokines, IL-6 levels in patients with COVID-19 are significantly elevated, and are

associated with adverse clinical outcomes. While inhibition of IL-6 levels with tocilizumab
appears to be effective and safe in preliminary investigations, results need to be evaluated of
ongoing clinical trials to better define the role of tocilizumab in COVID-19 and its routine
clinical application (34).
Pre-existing T-cell immunity to SARS-CoV-2 might be relevant also, because it might
influence COVID-19 disease severity. It is possible that people with high levels of preexisting memory CD4+ T-cells that recognize SARS-CoV-2 can mount a faster and stronger
immune response upon exposure to SARS-CoV-2, and thereby limit the disease severity.
Furthermore, in COVID-19 infections, microcapillary clotting in the lung generates
acute pulmonary embolisms, which impairs O2 acquisition by the lungs, thus resulting in
insufficient respiratory function. Of importance, low molecular weight heparin sulphate given
to the patients reduces their pain, improves their clinical status, reduces their IL-6 release, and
stabilises their oxygen exchange (35). At this time it is not clear if PolyP can suppress the
complement protein via the terminal pathway (15) and enhance the clotting formation. For
these reasons, cautions should be taken to treat late stage disease patients with PolyP.
Comorbidity, asymptomatic and symptomatic patients can use different immune
systems to fight SAR-CoV-2, where memory CD4+ T-cells have been shown to have a role
(36). The use of PolyPs can enhance the immunological memory, including T-cell activation,
and this can be monitored in vivo in further clinical trials. These will be issues for future
efforts.
Patients with COVID-19 suffer from respiratory failure. So new drugs formulated as
aerosols should represent a promising therapeutic approach. Interestingly, we also show here
that the efficacy of PolyPs is maintained when they are nebulised for their delivery to the
cells, as the PolyP120 still showed antiviral activity against SARS-CoV-2 in infected Vero

cells. Thus, we envision the aerosol delivery of PolyP120, for the treatment of patients with
respiratory failure. The final formulation will be discussed elsewhere.
Finally, these data show ‘preventive’ effects of the long chain length PolyPs against
SARS-CoV-2 infection. In this regard, the panel on Food Additives and Flavourings has
already provided information about the safety of phosphates as food additives (i.e., E450–
452) (37).
To date, among the drugs tested on COVID-19 patients, the safety and antiviral
activity of Remdesivir (GS-5734) is emerging in two completed phase 3 clinical trials
(NCT04292899, NCT04292730). Assuming no toxicity of PolyP120, we hypothesize its rapid
use in clinics in early phase of COVID-19 disease (2) alone or in combination with
Remdesivir. Thus, the use of PolyP120 against infections with SARS-CoV-2 or other new
expected virus can be envisioned for the near future.

For proteasome inhibition treatment Vero E6 cells were incubated in DMEM (10% FBS)
containing 10uM Mg132 (M8699; Sigma-Aldrich) for 24h; for protein synthesis inhibitor
treatment, Vero E6 cells were incubated in DMEM (10% FBS) containig 50 ug/mL
cycloheximide (C7698; Sigma-Aldrich) for 24h. For transcription inhibition treatment Vero
E6 cells were incubated in DMEM (10% FBS) containing 10 μg/mL Actinomycin D (A1410;
Sigma-Aldrich) for 24h. Following each treatment, cells were analyzed by Western Blotting
as described below.
HEK-293T or Human primary nasal epithelial cells were transiently transfected with the
plasmid DNA constructs (i.e. HA-ubiquitin plasmid, pGBW-m4134165 RdRp Ampr plasmid)
using HilyMaxTransfection Reagent (H357-10; Dojindo) according to the manufacturer
instructions. Hek 293T transfected cells were then treated for 24h with Polyp120 and
harvested for Western blotting 48 h after transfection. Human primary nasal epithelial cells
were then treated for 12h with PolyP8-MU and harvested for Immunostaining 48 h after
transfection.

In-vitro treatment and infection
Preventive treatment
Vero cells or human primary nasal epithelial cells were plated in T25 flasks (6 ×105
cells/flask) for treatment with 37.5 μM PolyPs (from P94 to P126). After 20 min, these pretreated cells were infected with SarsCov2 viral particles obtained from a frozen swab from an
Italian patient positive for COVID-19. Non-infected cells were used as the negative control.
After 12 h of infection, the cells were lysed and their RNA was extracted. Vehicle-treated
cells were used as the negative control for this treatment. These experiments were performed
in a B3 authorised laboratory.
Therapeutic treatment
Vero cells (4 ×105) were plated in six-well plates for the viral infection with SarsCov2 viral
particles, which were obtained from a frozen swab from Italian or Korean patients positive for
COVID-19. Non-infected cells were used as the negative infection control. After 24 h, the
infected cells were treated with PolyPs of different chain lengths (up to PolyP189) or
PolyP120 at different concentrations (9.38, 18.75, 37.5 μM). Vehicle-treated cells were used
as the negative treatment control. After 24 h of PolyPs treatments (i.e., 48 h after infection),
the Vero cells were lysed and their RNA was extracted. These experiments were performed in
a BLS3 authorised laboratory.
Nebulised PolyP120 treatment
Vero cells (6 ×105) were plated in a T25 flask. The PolyP120 (37.5 μM) was dissolved in 2
mL water solution and nebulised for 2 min using a nebuliser system (mesh nebulizer; YM –
252; input: 5 V/1 A; oscillation frequency, 110 kHz; atomised particles, <5 μM; condensation
rate, 1 mL/min). Following removal of the medium from the flask, the nebulised PolyP120
was directed into the flask. The medium was then replaced after the nebulising of the
PolyP120. PolyP120 in the cells was detected by immunofluorescence using DAPI. These

Vero cells treated with nebulised PolyP120 were then infected with the SARS-CoV-2 viral
particles.

Real-time RT assays:
N1-3 detection
RNA samples were extracted with TRIzol RNA Isolation Reagent (#15596018; Ambion,
Thermo Fisher Scientific), according to the manufacturer instructions. Real-time RT-PCR
was performed using ‘quanty COVID-19’ kits (Ref. RT-25; Clonit; US Food and Drug
Administration ‘in-vitro diagnostic’ (IVD) approved). These kits allow specific quantitative
detection of the N1, N2 and N3 fragments (from the Sars-CoV-2 N gene), using differentially
labelled target probes. These runs were performed on a PCR machine (CFX96; BioRad)
under the following conditions: 25 °C for 2 min; 50 °C for 15 min; 95 °C for 2 min; 95 °C for
3 s; 55 °C for 30 s (×45 cycles).
RdRp and E detection
RNA samples were extracted with TRIzol RNA Isolation Reagent (#15596018; Ambion,
Thermo Fisher Scientific), according to the manufacturer instructions. Real-time RT-PCR
was performed using ‘RealQquality RQ-2019-nCoV’ kits (Ab Analitica; IVD approved) for
detection of the RdRp and E genes (from the SarsCov2 N gene). These runs were performed
on a PCR machine (CFX96; BioRad) under the following conditions: 48 °C for 10 min; 95 °C
for 10 min; 95 °C for 15 s; 60 °C for 1 min (×45 cycles).
ACE2, N1, RdRp, E, S, sgM, sgE, sgN, sgS detection
RNA samples were extracted with TRIzol RNA Isolation Reagent (#15596018; Ambion,
Thermo Fisher Scientific), according to the manufacturer instructions. Reverse transcription
was carried out using ‘5× All-in-one RT Mastermix’ (#g486; ABM), following the
manufacturer instructions. The cDNA preparation was through the cycling method, as

follows: incubation of the complete reaction mix at 25 °C for 5 min; at 42 °C for 30 min; at
85 °C for 5 min; and hold at 4 °C. The reverse transcription products (cDNA) were amplified
by quantitative real-time PCR using a real-time PCR system (7900; Applied Biosystems,
Foster City, CA, USA). The relative expression of the target genes was determined using the
2−ΔCt method. All of the data are presented as means ±standard error of two to three
replicates. The target genes were detected using a Brightgreen 2× qPCR Mastermix low-rox
(#Mastermix-lr; ABM.). The details of the primers used in these assays are given in
Supplementary Table 1 in the Supplementary Information.
Nanopore RNA direct sequencing
To carry out the direct sequencing of the RNA with nanopore technology, we prepared the
RNA library using direct RNA sequencing kits (SQK-RNA002; Oxford Nanopore kits),
following the manufacturer instructions. Briefly, we used poly(dT) adapter and SuperScript II
Reverse Transcriptase (Thermo Fisher Scientific) to generate RNA-DNA hybrids. Agencourt
RNAClean XP magnetic beads (BECKMAN) were used to purify the RNA-DNA duplexes.
Subsequently, RNA-DNA hybrids were ligated to Nanopore sequencing adapters (RMX)
using T4 DNA ligase (NEB E6056) prior to sequencing. After another step of purification
using Agencourt RNAClean XP magnetic beads, the library concentration was estimated with
Qubit assay (Thermo Fisher). Then, the Nanopore direct RNA library was loaded into the
flow cell (R9.06) using MinION for 26 h. The motor protein RMX pulls the 3’-end of the
RNA strand into the Nanopore channel (39). Changes in the ionic current are then detected at
each pore by a sensor.
Classifying ONT reads from subgenomic RNAs
Reads from Nanopore direct sequencing were initially identified by alignment to a set of
reference sequences using Minimap2 version 2.17 (40), with the ‘long-read spliced
alignment’ preset. The reference sequences include SARS-CoV-2 viral genome (GenBank,

NC_045512), the Chlorocebus sabaeus host genome (assembly ChlSab 1.1), and the human
ribosomal DNA repeat (GenBank, U13369.1). Reads identified as viral were then realigned to
the same viral genome sequence using Minimap2, with the following options: -k 8 -w 1 -g
30000 --max-chain-skip 40 -p 0.7 -N 32 --frag=no --splice -G 30000 -C 0 -u n --spliceflank=no -A 1 -B 2 -O 2,24 -E 1,0 -z 400,200 --no-end-flt. Reads were assigned to each
canonical sgRNA by selecting those which overlapped the genomic interval 54-86 (leader),
did not overlap the genomic interval 100-21546 (ORF1ab), and contained the specific
downstream transcription regulatory sequence preceding each ORF (see Supplementary Table
2 for list of genomic intervals). Mapped reads filtering and counting were carried out by using
Samtools version 1.9 (http://htslib.org).
Sequence alignments
The

Statistical analysis
For the real-time PCR assays, Cq values of N1, N2 and N3 are reported as means ±standard
deviation, as the ratios to the internal control detected with the CLONIT quanty COVID-19
kits (Ref. RT-25; IVD approved). Statistical significance was defined as a p value <0.05
versus the vehicle control. Immunofluorescence data were analysed by two-sample t-tests
using the SPSS software, version 16.0. A probability (P)<0.05 was considered statistically
significant.

Electrostatic potential and docking experiments
Electrostatic potential calculations were carried out with Adaptive Poisson-Boltzmann Solver
software (41) within the AutoDock Tools environment (42) using the default parameters.

Mapping of the electrostatic potential onto the protein surface and display of the molecules
was carried out with PyMOL Molecular Graphics system (Version 1.8, Schrodinger LLC,
2015).
The PolyP molecule (ligand) containing 20 phosphate atoms (PolyP20) was built using
the tools available within the ZINC data bank web server (43), and then translated into PDB
coordinates. The three-dimensional structures of the receptor molecules were downloaded
from the PDB. The atom types and charges were assigned to the ligands and receptors using
the AutoDock Tools resources. All of the docking experiments were carried out with
Autodock Vina (44).

fractions of the reads mapped to the host genome. Note the different scales for the Y axes for
each sgRNA. (D) Vero cells were infected with SARS-CoV-2 viral particles (0.1 MOI), with
non-infected cells as negative control of infection. After 24 h, cells were treated with 37.5 μM
PolyP120 or vehicle, and 36 h later they were lysed and RNA was extracted. Ct values from
real-time RT-PCR are shown for expression of subgenomic (sg) viral RNAs, as indicated. (E)
Immunofluorescence with antibodies against N protein on Vero cells infected with SARSCoV-2 viral particles (0.1 MOI) and treated with PolyP120. The SIM image was acquired
with Elyra 7 and 3-dimentional (3D) reconstruction of Z stacking data were performed by
using ZEISS ZEN software (blue edition). Magnification 63×.

and vehicle, using antibodies as indicated. (C) Ct values from real-time RT-PCR following
RNA extraction, showing expression of interferon-γ, TNF-α and interleukins IL-6, IL-12, IL10. (D) Immunoblotting of SARS-CoV-2-infected Vero cells treated with 37.5 μM PolyP120
and vehicle, using antibodies as indicated. (E) Vero cells were treated with nebulised 37.5 μM
PolyP120. After 1 h, these cells were infected with SARS-CoV-2 viral particles (0.14 MOI),
with non-infected cells as negative control of infection. After 48 h, the cells were lysed and
RNA was extracted. Ct values from real-time RT-PCR are shown for expression of the ACE2,
CoV-2 N1, E, RdRp, S genes, and subgenomic (sg) viral RNAs, as indicated.

Figure 4. Intracellular mechanism of action of PolyP120. (A) HuluFISH with Pan-SARSCoV-2 probe (red) coupled to Immunofluorescence staining with antibody against ACE2
protein (green) on Vero cells infected with SARS-CoV-2 (Genbank: MT682732.1;
MT890669) particles (0.1 MOI) and treated with 37.5 μM PolyP120. The data shown a
substantial in cell downregulation of gRNA-Spike (red) and ACE protein (green) expression
in Poly120-treated versus vehicle cells. The SIM image was acquired with Elyra 7 and
processed by using ZEISS ZEN software (blue edition). Magnification 63×. (B) Cartoon
representation to illustrate our hypothesis for the anti-viral actions of PolyPs (e.g., P120).
PolyPs can act via proteasome-mediated degradation of ACE2 (A), and can impair RpRd
transcription of sgRNA genes viral transcription (B). Thus PolyPs can act extracellularly via
direct interactions with the host-cell ACE2, as the extracellular receptor for interaction with
the Spike of the virus, or intracellularly through its interactions with RdRp.
