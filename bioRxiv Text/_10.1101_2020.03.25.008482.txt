Abstract

17

SARS-CoV-2 emerged in China at the end of 2019 and has rapidly become a pandemic with

18

roughly 2.7 million recorded COVID-19 cases and greater than 189,000 recorded deaths by

19

April 23rd, 2020 (www.WHO.org). There are no FDA approved antivirals or vaccines for any

20

coronavirus, including SARS-CoV-2. Current treatments for COVID-19 are limited to supportive

21

therapies and off-label use of FDA approved drugs. Rapid development and human testing of

22

potential antivirals is greatly needed. A quick way to test compounds with potential antiviral

23

activity is through drug repurposing. Numerous drugs are already approved for human use and

24

subsequently there is a good understanding of their safety profiles and potential side effects,

making them easier to fast-track to clinical studies in COVID-19 patients. Here, we present data

26

on the antiviral activity of 20 FDA approved drugs against SARS-CoV-2 that also inhibit SARS-

27

CoV and MERS-CoV. We found that 17 of these inhibit SARS-CoV-2 at a range of IC50 values

28

at non-cytotoxic concentrations. We directly follow up with seven of these to demonstrate all are

29

capable of inhibiting infectious SARS-CoV-2 production. Moreover, we have evaluated two of

30

these, chloroquine and chlorpromazine, in vivo using a mouse-adapted SARS-CoV model and

31

found both drugs protect mice from clinical disease.

Introduction

34

At the end of December 2019, reports started to emerge from China of patients suffering from

35

pneumonia of unknown etiology. By early January, a new coronavirus had been identified and

36

determined as the cause (1). Since then, the virus originally known as novel coronavirus 2019

37

(nCoV-2019), now severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), has spread

38

around the world. As of April 23th, 2020, there have been roughly 2.7 million confirmed cases of

39

COVID-19 (the disease caused by SARS-CoV-2 infection) with over to 189,000 recorded deaths

40

(www.WHO.org). Multiple countries have enacted social distancing and quarantine measures,

41

attempting to reduce person-to-person transmission of the virus. Healthcare providers lack

42

pharmaceutical countermeasures against SARS-CoV-2, beyond public health interventions, and

43

there remains a desperate need for rapid development of antiviral therapeutics. A potential route

44

to candidate antivirals is through repurposing of already approved drugs (for reviews; (2â€“4) and

45

for examples;(5â€“8). We have previously screened a library of FDA approved drugs for antiviral

46

activity against two other highly pathogenic human coronaviruses, SARS-CoV and Middle East

47

respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV)(6). We found 27 drugs that inhibited replication

48

of both of these coronaviruses, suggesting that they may have broad anti-coronaviral activity.

49

One of the hits from this work was imatinib with which we subsequently determined the

50

mechanism of action by demonstrating this drug inhibits fusion of coronaviruses with cellular

51

membranes, thus blocking entry (9, 10).

52

53

Here, we present our investigation of 20 priority compounds from our previous screening to test

54

if they can also inhibit SARS-CoV-2. Since these compounds are already approved for use in

55

humans, they make ideal candidates for drug repurposing and rapid development as antiviral

56

therapeutics. Our work found that 17 of the 20 of the drugs that inhibited SARS-CoV and

57

MERS-CoV could also inhibit SARS-CoV-2, with similar IC50 values. We further assessed a

58

subset of these drugs for their effects on SARS-CoV-2 RNA and infectious virus production and

59

found all to have inhibitory activity. Our screening based on cytopathic effect therefore appears

60

a favorable approach to find drugs capable of inhibiting production of infectious virus. Currently

61

there are no established small animal model systems for SARS-CoV-2. However, there is a

62

well-established mouse-adapted system for SARS-CoV (MA15 strain(11)) and we present data

63

here assessing the in vivo efficacy of chloroquine (CQ) and chlorpromazine (CPZ) against

64

SARS-CoV. We found that drug treatment does not inhibit virus replication in mouse lungs, but

65

significantly improves clinical outcome. Based on both of these drugs inhibiting SARS-CoV-2

66

infection in vitro and providing protection in vivo against SARS-CoV clinical disease we believe

67

they may be beneficial for SARS-CoV-2 therapy, but require further study in clinical contexts.

from a patient in Washington State (WA-1 strain - BEI #NR-52281). Stocks were prepared by

76

infection of Vero E6 cells for two days when CPE was starting to be visible. Media were

77

collected and clarified by centrifugation prior to being aliquoted for storage at -80Â°C. Titer of

78

stock was determined by plaque assay using Vero E6 cells as described previously (12). All

79

work with infectious virus was performed in a Biosafety Level 3 laboratory and approved by our

80

Institutional Biosafety Committee. SARS-CoV stock was prepared as previously described (13).

81

SARS-CoV spike (S) pseudotype viruses were produced as previously described (9).

83

Drug testing

84

All drug screens were performed with Vero E6 cells. Cells were plated in opaque 96 well plates

85

one day prior to infection. Drug stocks were made in either DMSO, water or methanol. Drugs

86

were diluted from stock to 50 Î¼M and an 8-point 1:2 dilution series made. Cells were pre-treated

87

with drug for 2 hour (h) at 37Â°C/5% CO2 prior to infection at MOI 0.01 or 0.004. Vehicle controls

88

were used on every plate, and all treatments were performed in triplicate for each screen. In

89

addition to plates that were infected, parallel plates were left uninfected to monitor cytotoxicity of

90

drug alone. Three independent screens with this set-up were performed. Cells were incubated

91

at 37Â°C/5% CO2 for 3 days before performing CellTiter-Glo (CTG) assays as per the

92

manufacturerâ€™s instruction (Promega). Luminescence was read using a Molecular Devices

106

Nonlinear regression analysis was performed on the normalized %inhibit and %TOX data and

107

IC50s and CC50s were calculated from fitted curves (log [agonist] versus response - variable

108

slope [four parameters]) (GraphPad Software, LaJolla, CA), as described previously (14). Drug

109

dilution points in a given run were excluded from IC50 analysis if the average cytotoxicity was

110

greater than 30% (arbitrary cutoff) across the 3 cytotoxicity replicates for that screen. IC50 or

111

CC50 values extrapolated outside the drug dilution range tested were reported as greater than

112

50ÂµM or less than 0.39ÂµM. Selectivity indexes (SI) were also calculated by dividing the CC50 by

113

the IC50.

Viral infection

116

To further analyse candidate drugs, Vero E6 cells were grown in 24 well plate format for 24 h

117

prior to infection. As with the drug screens, cells were pre-treated with drug at a range of

118

concentrations, or vehicle control for 2 h. Cells were then infected with SARS-CoV-2 at MOI 0.1

119

for 24 hour (h). Supernatant was collected, centrifuged in a table-top centrifuge for 3 minutes

120

(min) at max speed and stored at -80Â°C. After a wash in PBS, infected cells were collected in

RNA extraction and qRT-PCR

125

RNA was extracted from TRIzol samples using Direct-zol RNA miniprep kit (Zymo Research) as

126

per the manufacturerâ€™s instructions. RNA was converted to cDNA using RevertAid RT Kit

127

(Thermo Scientific), with 12 Î¼l of extracted RNA per reaction. For qRT-PCR, 2 Î¼l of cDNA

128

reaction product was mixed with PowerUp SYBR Green Master Mix (Applied Biosystems) and

132

performed with a QuantStudio 5 (Applied Biosystems). To normalize loading, 18S RNA was

133

used as a control, assessed with TaqMan Gene Expression Assays (Applied Biosystems) and

All infections were performed in an animal biosafety level 3 facility at the University of Maryland,

151

Baltimore, using appropriate practices, including a HEPA-filtered bCON caging system, HEPA-

152

filtered powered air-purifying respirators (PAPRs), and Tyvek suiting. All animals were grown to

153

10 weeks of age prior to use in experiments. The animals were anesthetized using a mixture of

154

xylazine (0.38 mg/mouse) and ketamine (1.3 mg/mouse) in a 50 Î¼l total volume by

155

intraperitoneal injection. The mice were inoculated intranasally with 50 Î¼l of either PBS or 2.5 x

156

103 PFU of rMA15 SARS-CoV (11) after which all animals were monitored daily for weight loss.

157

Mice were euthanized at day 4 post-infection, and lung tissue was harvested for further

Screening FDA approved compounds for anti-SARS-CoV-2 activity

173

Previously, we performed a large-scale drug screen on 290 FDA approved compounds to

174

investigate which may have antiviral activity against SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV (6). With the

175

emergence of SARS-CoV-2, we prioritized testing 20 of the 27 hits that were determined to

176

inhibit both of the previously tested coronaviruses for antiviral activity against the novel virus.

177

The list of tested compounds is shown in Table 1. Our screening started at 50 Î¼M and used an

178

8-point, 1:2 dilution series with infections being performed at either MOI 0.01 or 0.004. CellTiter-

179

Glo (CTG) assays were performed 3 days post-infection to determine relative cell viability

180

between drug and vehicle control treated cells. Uninfected samples were used to measure the

181

cytotoxicity of drug alone. From the relative luminescence data of the CTG assay, percent

182

inhibition (of cell death caused by viral infection) could be measured and plotted along with the

183

percent cytotoxicity of drug alone. Fig. 1 shows these plotted graphs from one representative of

184

three independent screens at MOI 0.01. For those drugs demonstrating a cell toxicity rate lower

185

than 30%, we were able to calculate IC50 values at both MOI from these graphs for 17 of the 20

186

drugs which is summarized in Table 1.

187

188

Drug screen validation

189

In order to validate our screening process as a means to identify compounds with antiviral effect

190

we decided to follow up with a subset of drugs. Chloroquine (CQ) has become the source of

191

much interest as a potential treatment for COVID19 (16), as such, we further investigated

192

hydroxychloroquine (HCQ) and CQ as both were present in our screen (Table 1). Vero E6 cells

193

were plated and pre-treated with drug for 2 h prior to infection with SARS-CoV-2 at MOI 0.1.

194

Supernatant was collected 24 h post-infection to determine titer of virus by TCID50 assay and

195

cells were collected in TRIzol to assess production of viral mRNA. Treatment with both drugs

196

caused a significant reduction in viral mRNA levels, especially at higher concentrations, without

197

drug induced cytotoxicity (Fig. 1 and Table 1). There was a significant decrease in relative

198

expression levels of both RdRp and N mRNA across the range of concentrations used (Fig. 2A-

199

D). Along with causing a reduction in viral mRNA, treatment with both drugs caused a significant

200

reduction in viral replication (Fig. 2E and 2F). SARS-CoV-2 production was more sensitive to

201

HCQ than CQ with larger inhibition seen at the same concentration of treatment, which is in

202

agreement with HCQ having a lower IC50 in our cell viability assay (Table 1). We also

203

performed a time of addition assay with the highest concentration of HCQ to investigate whether

204

SARS-CoV-2 entry was the point of inhibition of this compound (Fig. 2G). Interestingly, while the

205

addition of HCQ at 2h post-infection did have some reduction in inhibitory activity there was not

206

a complete loss, suggesting that HCQ treatment may impact other stages of the viral life cycle

207

than just entry.

208

209

We have previously used a Î²-lactamase-Vpr chimeric protein (Vpr-BlaM) pseudotype system to

210

demonstrate that imatinib (a drug also seen to inhibit SARS-CoV-2 [Table 1 and Fig. 1]) inhibits

211

SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV spike-mediated entry (9). We used this system to more directly

212

investigate whether CQ could inhibit viral entry mediated by coronavirus spike, and additionally

213

included chlorpromazine (CPZ) as this is known to inhibit clathrin-mediated endocytosis (17)

214

and was also part of our drug screening (Table 1 and Fig. 2). In this assay, when the

215

pseudovirus fuses with a cellular membrane, BlaM is released into the cytoplasm of the infected

216

cell. BlaM cleaves cytoplasmic loaded CCF2 to change its emission spectrum from 520 nm

217

(green) to ~450 nm (blue), which can be quantified using flow cytometry.

218

219

Cells were treated with CQ or CPZ for 1 h before infection with BlaM-containing SARS-S

220

pseudovirions (PV). Cells were then analyzed by flow cytometry to quantify the cleavage of

221

CCF2. In mock treated cells infected with SARS-S PV there was a shift in the CCF2 emission

222

spectrum indicating release of BlaM to the cytosol, and that spike-mediated fusion with cellular

223

had occurred. Upon treatment with CQ or CPZ there was a greater than 90% reduction in CCF2

224

cleavage caused by SARS-S PV (Fig. 2H). These data demonstrate that both drugs inhibit

225

SARS-CoV spike-mediated fusion with cellular membranes. These pseudotype assays suggest

226

that the inhibition of coronavirus replication caused by CQ and CPZ is at the stage of entry to

227

cells but combined with the time of addition assays (Fig. 2G), there is a suggestion that later

228

stages may also be impacted.

229

230

HCQ and CQ are used as anti-malarial drugs and are in the class of aminoquinolines which are

231

hemozoin inhibitors, similarly to 4-methanolquinolines. Interestingly, from our drug screening,

232

three other hemozoin inhibitors were identified: amodiaquine dihydrochloride dihydrate,

233

amodiaquine hydrochloride and mefloquine. We therefore decided to directly test these drugs

234

for antiviral activity against SARS-CoV-2. We directly tested CPZ against SARS-CoV-2 having

235

seen that it could inhibit SARS-CoV S-mediated entry to cells (Fig. 2H). We also included

236

imatinib since we have previously shown that this can inhibit entry of both SARS-CoV and

237

MERS-CoV (9) and was a hit against SARS-CoV-2 (Fig. 1 and Table 1). Again, cells were pre-

238

treated with drugs at the indicated concentrations and infected with SARS-CoV-2 at MOI 0.1 for

239

24h, after which supernatant samples were collected. As can be seen in Fig. 3, at the highest

240

concentrations of all drugs there is significant inhibition of SARS-CoV-2 infection. All five drugs

241

showed very strong inhibition at 20 Î¼M.

242

243

Overall, the data from Fig. 2 and Fig. 3 indicate that there are various FDA approved drugs that

244

have broad-spectrum anti-coronavirus activity in vitro and that our initial screening based on

245

cytopathic effect is a good method to identify compounds with antiviral activity.

249

CQ and CPZ treatment displayed significant inhibition of coronavirus replication in vitro, with our

250

data suggesting entry is inhibited. We therefore decided to investigate whether these drugs

251

were efficacious in vivo using SARS-CoV strain, MA15 in BALB/c mice. This model displays

252

~15-20% weight loss by 4 days post infection (dpi), occasionally resulting in death. We tested

253

whether prophylactically administered CQ or CPZ could protect mice from severe MA15

254

infection. Mice were injected intraperitoneally with either water, 0.8 mg CQ, 1.6 mg CQ, 20 Âµg

255

CPZ, 100 Âµg CPZ or 200 Âµg CPZ at day -1 of infection and then were dosed every day through

256

the 4 days of infection. On day 0, mice were intranasally infected with 2.5 x 103 pfu of SARS-

257

CoV (MA15) or PBS as control. Weight loss was measured as a correlate of disease and mice

258

were euthanized at 4 dpi for analysis.

259

260

PBS inoculated mice showed no weight loss or clinical signs of disease when treated with either

261

water, CQ or CPZ over the experiment time course indicating drug treatment did not adversely

262

affect morbidity (Fig. 4A and 4D). Mice that were infected with MA15 and treated with water lost

263

~15% of their starting body weight over 4 days and had significant clinical signs of disease

264

including ruffled fur, labored breathing and lethargy (Fig. 4A and 4D). Mice that were treated

265

with 0.8 mg of CQ each day, displayed similar weight loss as the water control through the first

266

3 days of infection, however by 4 dpi the weight loss was halted in the drug treated mice (Fig.

267

4A). Mice that were treated with 1.6 mg CQ per day showed markedly reduced weight loss

268

compared to the water control (Fig. 4A). Pathological analysis was also performed on H&E

269

stained sections. Mice infected with MA15 and treated with water displayed significant

270

inflammation and denuding bronchiolitis suggesting severe disease (Fig. 4B). By contrast, 0.8

271

mg CQ dose group had moderate inflammation that was reduced compared to control and the

272

1.6 mg dose group had minimal lung pathology (Fig. 4B). Interestingly, even though CQ

273

treatment appeared to protect against weight loss and inflammation in the lungs, the viral titer

274

was equivalent between drug treated and vehicle control mice (Fig. 4C).

276

Similar to the CQ results, CPZ treatment reduced weight loss in mice infected with MA15 at 100

277

Âµg and 200 Âµg, but the 20 Âµg treatment group were equivalent to vehicle control (Fig. 4D) and

278

the H&E sections showed protection against inflammation and denuding bronchiolitis at the

279

higher doses (Fig. 4E). Again, as with CQ treatment, even though there were reduced signs of

280

infection with CPZ treatment, there was no difference in MA15 titer in the mouse lungs (Fig. 4F).

281

Overall these data indicate that even though CQ and CPZ treatment do not inhibit viral

282

replication in the lungs, both can protect mice from signs of disease following SARS-CoV

283

(MA15) infection.

Discussion

286

The SARS-CoV-2 pandemic has demonstrated the desperate need for antiviral drugs. Since the

287

emergence of SARS-CoV in 2002, research has uncovered many details of coronavirus biology

288

and pathogenesis, however there are currently no approved therapeutics against this emerging

289

virus family. Whether being used for treating SARS-CoV-2 in this current pandemic or the next

290

unknown viral pathogen in the future, we must attempt to develop and validated antiviral drugs

291

that are ready to be used at the first signs of an outbreak. Many FDA approved drugs have been

292

found to have antiviral activity in addition to their approved use (e.g; (5â€“8)), and since these are

293

extensively used in humans for other conditions, they could be streamlined for rapid approval

294

and repositioning as antivirals. In our previous work, 290 FDA approved drugs were screened

295

for antiviral activity and 27 were found to inhibit both SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV (6). We

296

prioritized testing these for antiviral activity against SARS-CoV-2 since they displayed broad-

297

spectrum antiviral activity. From multiple independent screens performed with two MOI, we

298

found that 17 of our 20 tested priority compounds display significant antiviral activity at non-

299

cytotoxic concentrations. Many of the compounds have IC50 values under 10 Î¼M and these will

300

be the source of follow up testing on additional cell lines and in mouse models of SARS-CoV-2.

301

302

We further investigated seven of the hits to directly test if they inhibited SARS-CoV-2 replication.

303

We performed follow-up experiments with HCQ, CQ, amodiaquine and mefloquine because

304

chloroquine has garnered much interest as a potential treatment for COVID19 (16) and the

305

others are similarly used as anti-malarial compounds (18). In addition, we have previously

306

demonstrated that imatinib is an inhibitor of SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV and infectious bronchitis

307

virus entry to cells (9, 10) so included that here as the mechanism of coronavirus inhibition is

308

understood. Finally, CPZ inhibits clathrin function in cells (17) so can disrupt infection by many

309

viruses that require clathrin-mediated endocytosis and was therefore also chosen for further

310

analysis. Treatment of cells with all these drugs showed inhibition of infectious viral particle

311

production (measured by TCID50 assay) at non-cytotoxic levels.

312

313

Having demonstrated that HCQ, CQ and CPZ can inhibit cytopathic effect, mRNA synthesis and

314

infectious viral particle production of SARS-CoV-2, we used a previously published system of

315

SARS-CoV pseudotype viruses carrying Vpr-BlaM to investigate whether CQ and CPZ inhibit

316

coronavirus spike-mediated entry to better define mechanism of action. We have previously

317

used this system to define imatinib as an entry inhibitor of these viruses (9) and found similar

318

results for CQ and CPZ, thus better defining their mechanism of antiviral activity.

319

320

Finally, we investigated the efficacy of CQ and CPZ with an in vivo model using SARS-CoV

321

MA15. There is currently a lack of an established mouse model for SARS-CoV-2 so we used the

322

mouse adapted SARS-CoV (MA15) strain as a surrogate to assess the in vivo efficacy of these

323

drugs against a closely related coronavirus. We are of the opinion that this is a good model

324

since both viruses use ACE2 as a receptor (19â€“22) and therefore have a similar cellular tropism

325

which is important since both of these compounds appear to inhibit viral entry. Prophylactic

326

dosing in MA15 infection experiments demonstrated that, in contrast to the in vitro antiviral

13

327

activity, CQ and CPZ did not inhibit viral replication in mouse lungs based on viral titer

328

recovered from lungs at 4 dpi. However, both drugs resulted in reduced weight loss and

329

improved clinical outcome, with the higher dose giving greater protection. Along with being an

330

anti-malarial, CQ is used in humans for the treatment of systemic lupus erythematosus and

331

rheumatoid arthritis because of anti-inflammatory properties and has effects on antigen

332

presentation (23â€“25). We speculate that these properties may have a role in the protection we

333

observe in vivo since much of the pathology from SARS-CoV is a consequence of

334

immunopathology during infection (in mice; (26), in non-human primates (27) and for a detail

335

review (28)). These results suggest that CQ alone may not be a viable therapeutic but may be

336

beneficial for treatment of SARS-CoV-2 in combination with more directly acting antivirals such

337

as remdesivir (29â€“31).

338

339

The development of antiviral drugs for emerging coronaviruses is a global priority. In the middle

340

of the COVID19 pandemic, we must identify rapidly accessible therapeutics that are validated in

341

both in vitro and in vivo models. FDA approved drugs being assessed for repurposing and other

342

experimental drugs in development must be properly validated in animal studies to best assess

343

their potential utility in people. We have presented here a list of FDA approved drugs that are

344

effective in vitro against SARS-CoV-2 as well as being effective against SARS-CoV and MERS-

345

CoV (6). Moreover, we have demonstrated that two of these, CQ and CPZ, can protect mice

346

from severe clinical disease from SARS-CoV. Future research will be aimed at testing these

347

compounds in SARS-CoV-2 animal models to further assess their potential utility for human

348

treatment.

with each drug across the 4 day infection time course. Water was used as the vehicle control for

513

both drugs and PBS was used as a control for uninfected mice. A) Weight loss of mice treated

514

with CQ at two different dose levels (0.8 mg and 1.6 mg) over the 4 day infection. Data are

515

presented as relative weight loss compared to the mouse weight on day 0. In each treatment

516

group there were 5 mice and the data are mean average and standard deviation. B) At day 4,

517

mice were euthanized and lung sections were used for H&E staining. C) In addition to collecting

518

lungs for section staining, there was also collection to determine titer of virus by plaque assay.

519

D) Weight loss of mice treated with CPZ at three different doses (20 Âµg, 100 Âµg, and 200 Âµg)

520

with the same experimental set up as in A. E and F) As B and C but for CPZ treated mice.

526

B â€“ At least one CC50 could be extrapolated from the curve fit suggesting toxicity and SI are

527

slightly higher than listed

528

C â€“ No CC50 could be extrapolated from the curve fit suggesting toxicity and SI are much

529

higher than listed.
