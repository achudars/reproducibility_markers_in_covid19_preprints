Abstract
The dependence of the host on the interaction of hundreds of extracellular proteins with the cell
surface glycosaminoglycan heparan sulphate (HS) for the regulation of homeostasis is exploited
by many microbial pathogens as a means of adherence and invasion. The closely related polysaccharide heparin, the widely used anticoagulant drug, which is structurally similar to HS and is a
common experimental proxy, can be expected to mimic the properties of HS. Heparin prevents
infection by a range of viruses if added exogenously, including S-associated coronavirus strain
HSR1. Heparin prevents infection by a range of viruses if added exogenously, including S-associated coronavirus strain HSR1. Here, we show that the addition of heparin to Vero cells between
6.25 - 200 μg.ml-1, which spans the concentration of heparin in therapeutic use, and inhibits invasion by SARS-CoV-2 at between 44 and 80%. We also demonstrate that heparin binds to the Spike
(S1) protein receptor binding domain and induces a conformational change, illustrated by surface
plasmon resonance and circular dichroism spectroscopy studies. The structural features of heparin
on which this interaction depends were investigated using a library of heparin derivatives and sizedefined fragments. Binding is more strongly dependent on the presence of 2-O or 6-O sulphation,
and the consequent conformational consequences in the heparin structure, than on N-sulphation.
A hexasaccharide is required for conformational changes to be induced in the secondary structure
that are comparable to those that arise from heparin binding. Enoxaparin, a low molecular weight
clinical anticoagulant, also binds the S1 RBD protein and induces conformational change. These
findings have implications for the rapid development of a first-line therapeutic by repurposing heparin as well as for next-generation, tailor-made, GAG-based antiviral agents against SARS-CoV-2
and other members of the Coronaviridae.

Introduction
Heparin, the second most widely used drug by weight globally, is formulated as a polydisperse, heterogeneous natural product. Unfractionated heparin, low molecular
weight heparins, such as enoxaparin, and heparinoids are clinically approved as anticoagulants and anti-thrombotic agents with excellent safety, stability, bioavailability
and pharmacokinetic profiles. Crucially, heparin and its derivatives, some of which lack
significant anticoagulant activity 1, constitute an under-exploited antiviral drug class.
This is despite the fact that they exhibit broad-spectrum activity against numerous distinct viruses, including Coronaviridae and SARS-associated coronavirus strain HSR1
2
, in addition to flaviviruses 3,4, herpes 5, influenza 6 and HIV 7,8.
Conventional drug development processes are slow to respond to emerging public
health threats, such as the current SARS-CoV-2 coronavirus outbreak, which makes
the repurposing of existing drugs a timely and attractive alternative. Heparin, a welltolerated anticoagulant pharmaceutical, has been used safely in medicine for over 80
years and, alongside its anticoagulant activities, its ability to prevent viral infection,
including by members of the Coronaviridae, has been described 2. The closely related
glycosaminoglycan (GAG) member, heparan sulphate (HS), is also known to bind CoV
surface proteins and is exploited by coronavirus for its attachment to target cells 9.
Furthermore, anticoagulant and anti-inflammatory therapy, which are both associated
with heparin use, have been shown to be beneficial for COVID-19 management 10,11.
Heparan sulphate is a ubiquitous component of the cell surface and the extracellular
matrix with a complex non-template driven biosynthesis, involving many enzymes, the
consequence of which is a heterogeneous structure. Currently, HS and heparin are
known to bind to over 700 proteins 12. Heparan sulphate and heparin are linear, sulphated polysaccharides, comprising repeating disaccharide units of a uronic acid and
D-glucosamine. They are linked by 1,4 glycosidic bonds and the uronic acid can be
either β D-glucuronic acid or its C-5 epimer, α L-iduronic acid (properly, glucuronate
and iduronate respectively under physiological conditions). The disaccharide can be
subject to several further modifications; iduronate can be O-sulphated at position-2,
glucosamine can be N-sulphated, N-acetylated or unmodified, and adorned with Osulphates at position-6 and, less frequently, at position-3 13.
The anticoagulant properties of heparin arise predominantly from its interaction with
serine proteases, particularly antithrombin and the pentasaccharide sequence;
GlcNS,6S-GlcA-GlcNS,3S,6S-IdoA2S-GlcNS,6S, has been identified as being most
significant in this regard 14. On the other hand, its antiviral and anti-inflammatory properties have not been linked to specific sequences enabling strategies to be developed
for the production of heparin with tailored activities (i.e., non-anticoagulant but antiviral) that involve cleaving/disrupting the chain at the antithrombin interacting pentasaccharide, or by globally altering the chemical properties of the chain. Since heparin
is a complex mixture, containing polysaccharide chains of varied composition and
bearing different biological activities, an alternative approach would be to fractionate
the heterogeneous heparin mixture and isolate those fractions with the required activities.

As yet, there are no commercially available medicinal products designed to treat
and/or prevent infections associated with the current SARS-CoV-2 coronavirus outbreak. Here, we describe the ability of heparin to inhibit cell invasion and bind the
SARS-CoV-2 S1 receptor binding domain (RBD) and investigate the structural requirements and consequences of binding. The results underpin the development of heparin-based therapeutics for Covid-19 and future viral diseases.

Methods & Materials
2.1 Viral invasion assay.
Vero cells (ECACC) were plated at 2.5 x 105 cells per well in 24-well plates and incubated with EMEM supplemented with 10% (v/v) foetal calf serum (complete medium).
Twenty four hours later, cells were incubated with heparin (from 200 µg.ml-1; Celsus Laboratories, Cincinnati, USA) in 300 µL of complete medium 1 hour prior to infection and then incubated with virus solution containing 50 plaque forming units (PFU)
of either; Italy/UniSR1/2020 strain (GISAID accession ID: EPI_ISL_413489 15, or,
SARS-CoV HSR-1 (EID 2004). After incubation for 1 hour at 37°C, supernatants were
discarded and 500 µL of 1% (w/v) methylcellulose (Sigma-Aldrich, Italy) overlay (in
complete medium) were added to each well. After 3 days, cells were fixed using a 6%
(v/v) formaldehyde: phosphate-buffered saline solution and stained with 1% (w/v) crystal violet (Sigma-Aldrich, Italy) in 70% (v/v) methanol (Sigma-Aldrich, Italy). The
plaques were counted under a stereoscopic microscope (SMZ-1500, Nikon).
2.2 Recombinant expression of SARS-CoV-2 S1 RBD.
Residues 330−583 of the SARS-CoV-2 Spike Protein (GenBank: MN908947) were
cloned upstream of a N-terminal 6XHisTag in the pRSETA expression vector and
transformed into SHuffle® T7 Express Competent E. coli (NEB, UK). Protein expression was carried out in MagicMedia™ E. coli Expression Media (Invitrogen, UK) at
30°C for 24 hrs, 250 rpm. The bacterial pellet was suspended in 5 mL lysis buffer
(BugBuster Protein Extraction Reagent, Merck Millipore, UK; containing DNAse) and
incubated at room temperature for 30 mins. Protein was purified from inclusion bodies
using IMAC chromatography under denaturing conditions. On-column protein refolding was performed by applying a gradient with decreasing concentrations of the denaturing agent (6 - 0 M Urea). After extensive washing, protein was eluted using 20 mM
NaH2PO4, pH 8.0, 300 mM NaCl, 500 mM imidazole. Fractions were pooled and
buffer-exchanged to phosphate-buffered saline (PBS; 140 mM NaCl, 5 mM NaH2PO4,
5 mM Na2HPO4, pH 7.4; Lonza, UK) using a Sephadex G-25 column (GE Healthcare,
UK). Recombinant protein was stored at -20°C until required.
2.3 Preparation of chemically modified heparin derivatives.
All chemically modified heparin polysaccharides (Table 1) were synthesised from parental unfractionated porcine mucosal heparin (Mw = 12 kDa; Celsus Laboratories,
Cincinnati, USA) as previously described 6,16. The veracity of all chemical modifications was ascertained using 1H and 13C NMR, with chemical shifts compared to TSP
(Sigma-Aldrich, UK) as an external reference standard.

2.4 Secondary structure determination of SARS-CoV-2 S1 RBD by circular dichroism spectroscopy.
The circular dichroism (CD) spectrum of the SARS-CoV-2 S1 RBD in PBS was recorded using a J-1500 Jasco CD spectrometer (Jasco, UK), Spectral Manager II software (JASCO, UK) and a 0.2 mm pathlength, quartz cuvette (Hellma, USA) scanning
at 100 nm.min-1 with 1 nm resolution throughout the range 190 - 260 nm. All spectra
obtained were the mean of five independent scans, following instrument calibration
with camphorsulfonic acid. SARS-CoV-2 S1 RBD was buffer-exchanged (prior to
spectral analysis) using a 5 kDa Vivaspin centrifugal filter (Sartorius, Germany) at
12,000 g, thrice and CD spectra were collected using 21 μl of a 0.6 mg.ml-1 solution in
PBS, pH 7.4. Spectra of heparin (porcine mucosal heparin), its derivative and oligosaccharides were collected in the same buffer at approximately comparable concentrations, since these are disperse materials. Collected data were analysed with Spectral Manager II software prior to processing with GraphPad Prism 7, using second
order polynomial smoothing through 21 neighbours. Secondary structural prediction
was calculated using the BeStSel analysis server 17.To ensure that the CD spectral
change of SARS-CoV-2 S1 RBD in the presence of porcine mucosal heparin did not
arise from the addition of the heparin alone, which is known to possess a CD spectrum
at high concentrations 18,19 a difference spectrum was analysed. The theoretical, CD
spectrum that resulted from the arithmetic addition of the CD spectrum of the SARSCoV-2 S1 RBD and that of the heparin differed from the observed experimental CD
spectrum of SARS-CoV-2 S1 RBD mixed with heparin. This demonstrates that the
change in the CD spectrum arose from a conformational change following binding to
porcine mucosal heparin.
2.5 Surface Plasmon Resonance determination of SARS-CoV-2 S1 RBD binding
to unfractionated heparin.
Human FGF2 was produced as described by Duchesne et al. 20. Porcine mucosal
heparin was biotinylated at the reducing end using hydroxylamine biotin (ThermoFisher, UK) as described by Thakar et al. 21. Heparin (20 µl of 50 mg mL-1) was
reacted with 20 µl hydroxylamine-biotin in 40 µl 300 mM aniline (Sigma-Aldrich, UK)
and 40 µl 200 mM acetate pH 6 for 48 h at 37 °C. Free biotin was removed by gelfiltration chromatography on Sephadex G25 (GE LifeSciences, UK).
A P4SPR, multi-channel Surface Plasmon Resonance (SPR) instrument (Affinté Instruments; Montréal, Canada) was employed with a gold sensor chip that was plasma
cleaned prior to derivatization. A self-assembled monolayer of mPEG thiol and biotin
mPEG was formed by incubating the chip in a 1 mM solution of these reagents at a
99:1 molar ratio in ethanol for 24 hrs 22. The chip was rinsed with ethanol and placed
in the instrument. PBS (1X) was used as the running buffer for the three sensing and
a fourth background channel at 500 µl.min-1, using an Ismatec pump. Twenty micrograms of streptavidin (Sigma, UK; 1 ml in PBS) were injected over the four sensor
channels. Subsequently, biotin-heparin (1 ml) was injected over the three sensing
channels.
Binding experiments used PBS with 0.02% Tween 20 (v/v) as the running buffer. The
ligand was injected over the three sensing channels, diluted to the concentration indicated in the figure legends at 500 µl.min-1. Sensor surfaces with bound FGF2 were

regenerated by a wash with 2 M NaCl (Fisher Scientific, UK). However, this was found
to be ineffectual for SARS-CoV-2 S1 RBD. Partial regeneration of the surface was
achieved with 20 mM HCl (VWR, UK) and only 0.25 % (w/v) SDS (VWR, UK) was
found to remove the bound protein. After regeneration with 0.25 % (w/v/) SDS, fluidics
and surfaces were washed with 20 mM HCl to ensure all traces of the detergent were
removed. Background binding to the underlying streptavidin bound to the mPEG/biotin
mPEG self-assembled monolayer was determined by injection over the control channel. Responses are reported as the change in plasmon resonance wavelength, in nm
and for the three control channels represent their average response.
2.6 Prediction of SARS-CoV-2 S1 heparin binding domain.
The methods employed to predict heparin binding sequences within the SARS-CoV-2
S1 RBD are described in Rudd et al. 23. A brief description of the method follows. In
combination, Ori et al. 24 and Nunes et al. 12 identified 786 heparin binding proteins. In
this study, 776 heparin binding proteins, from the previously identified list, were decomposed into amino acid sequences containing no less than 3 residues with at less
one basic amino acid. To simplify the problem, the heparin binding proteins were fragmented into sequences containing the following combination of amino acids; BX, BXA,
BXS, BXP, BXAS, BXAP and BXPS (where, B = basic, X = hydrophobic, A = acidic, P
= polar and S = special). These sequences were compared using a metric based on
the Levenshtein distance, a measure of the similarity between strings of characters,
which is defined as the minimum number of insertions, deletions or substitutions that
need to be applied to the characters to alter one sequence so that it matches the other.
Sequences with a similarity score of greater than 0.7 (70% similarity) were considered
highly conserved. These sets of highly conserved basic amino acid containing sequences found in heparin binding proteins were then used to identify possible heparin
binding sequences within SARS-CoV-2 S1, utilizing the same Levenshtein similarity
cut-off of 0.7.

Results
3.1 SARS-CoV-2 viral plaque forming assays.
Progeny infectious virion production was measured in culture supernatants using
standard plaque forming assays on Vero cells with and without pre-treatment of incubated heparin (from 200 μg.ml-1, one hour prior to infection) with both a historical
SARS-CoV strain HSR-1 and the recent SARS-CoV-2 strain, Italy/UniSR1/2020. Significant decreases were observed in the number of PFU upon heparin treatment for
both SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2, with the later demonstrating significantly higher
levels of inhibition (80%) compared to that of SARS-CoV (Figure 1).
3.2 Surface Plasmon Resonance binding studies.
FGF2, a well-characterised heparin-binding protein was used to confirm the successful functionalization of the three sensing channels with biotin-heparin. Injection of 1 ml
100 nM FGF2 over the sensing channels elicited a significant response (Figure 2A,
injection between the blue and red arrow). However, 100 nM FGF2 elicited no response in the control channel, functionalized solely with streptavidin (Figure 2A). The

bound FGF2 was removed by a wash with 2 M NaCl, as previously for the IASys optical biosensor 16.
When 100 nM SARS-CoV-2 S1 RBD was injected over the three sensing channels,
there was an increase in signal, of binding (Figure 2B injection start blue arrow). At
the end of the injection the system returned to running buffer (PBST, red arrow). There
was no dissociation. This is common in surface measurement, particularly in flow systems, due to the extensive boundary layer of liquid enabling rebinding of the analyte
and often causes a substantial underestimation of the dissociation rate, koff, which can
be remedied by the addition of soluble ligand 25. The injection of 100 nM SARS-CoV2 S1 RBD over the control channel, functionalised with just streptavidin, showed a
small increase in response (Figure 2B) of the order of 10% of that seen in the measurement channel. Repeated measurements indicate that this is the maximum level of
background binding. These data demonstrate that 100 nM SARS-CoV-2 S1 RBD
binds specifically to heparin immobilised through its reducing end and does not interact to a major extent with the underlying streptavidin/ethyleneglycol surface. It should
be noted that when biotin-heparin is anchored to the streptavidin layer, as in the measurement channels, such background binding will be reduced, since less of the underlying surface is exposed. This is illustrated in the competition experiments, in which
soluble heparin was able to completely abrogate the binding of SARS-CoV-2 S1 RBD
to the surface (Figure 3A).
In a first set of competition experiments, immobilised 100 nM SARS-CoV-2 S1 RBD
was exposed to heparin or enoxaparin at the indicated concentration. The response
when the surface returned to running buffer, PBST, was then measured. This is appropriate, since there is no appreciable dissociation of the heparin-bound SARS-CoV2 S1 RBD when the surface returns to PBST (Figure 2B) and it ensures that any
differences in refractive index of samples do not interfere with the measurement. At
0.0017 mg.ml-1 heparin, a small reduction in the binding of SARS-CoV-2 S1 RBD was
observed (Figure 3A) and, as the concentration of heparin increased, the binding of
SARS-CoV-2 S1 RBD decreased in a dose-dependent manner. SARS-CoV-2 S1 RBD
binding was completely abrogated by 1.7 mg.ml-1 heparin. Enoxaparin was also found
to inhibit the binding of SARS-CoV-2 S1 RBD, but on a weight basis was less potent
than heparin (Figure 3A). Thus, a small inhibition of binding was observed at 0.017
mg/mL Enoxaparin and the maximal inhibition observed with this polysaccharide was
70% at 1.7 mg.ml-1. These data indicate that heparin is ~30-fold more potent an inhibitor of the interaction of SARS-CoV-2 S1 RBD with immobilised heparin than Enoxaparin. We then examined whether short oligosaccharides could inhibit SARS-CoV-2 S1
RBD binding. A heparin-derived octasaccharide (dp 8) was without effect, but a decasaccharide (dp10) at 0.17 mg.ml-1 showed a modest inhibition of SARS-CoV-2 S1
RBD binding to immobilised heparin. Whether these data reflect a true requirement for
a longer structure for SARS-CoV-2 S1 RBD binding or instead, reflect a selective reduction in the presence of particular binding structures in the polysaccharide as a consequence of the processes (β-elimination for enoxaparin and partial enzymatic heparin degradation for oligosaccharides), remains to be determined.
We next tested the ability of a library of heparins that had been selectively modified
(Table 1) to inhibit SARS-CoV-2 S1 RBD binding. These showed different levels of
inhibitory activity, depending on their pattern of sulphation. Of the singly desulphated

Mycroft-West et al. (2020)

heparins, heparin 2, which is N-desulphated/N-re-acetylated, showed inhibitory activity at 0.05 mg.ml-1 and 0.17 mg.ml-1, whereas heparin 3 and heparin 4, which are 2-O
and 6-O desulphated, respectively, had no detectable inhibitory activity (Figure 3C).
This suggests that SARS-CoV-2 S1 RBD has a preference for tracts of saccharides
that are 2-O and 6-O sulphated. Interestingly, the doubly desulphated heparins (heparin 5, heparin 6, heparin 7) possessed inhibitory activity, albeit lower than the native
heparin (Figure 3C). Since the sulphation of the polysaccharide has a marked effect
on its conformation 16,18,19,26 these data suggest that the SARS-CoV-2 S1 RBD may
have a preference for a particular spatial arrangement of charged groups. Completely
desulphated heparin (heparin 8) has no inhibitory activity, indicating that ionic interactions with sulphate groups make an important contribution to the interaction of the
SARS-CoV-2 S1 RBD with the polysaccharide. Per-sulphated heparin (heparin 9) inhibited most strongly of the heparin derivatives, but not as effectively as native heparin. Again, this indicates the likely importance of the conformation of the polysaccharide for SARS-CoV-2 S1 RBD binding, since sulphation on all available hydroxyls renders the polysaccharide more rigid and restrict is conformational flexibility 26.
3.3 Secondary structure determination of SARS-CoV-2 S1 RBD protein by circular dichroism spectroscopy
Circular dichroism (CD) spectroscopy in the far UV region (190 - 260 nm) detects conformational changes in protein secondary structure that occur in solution and can infer
binding by an added ligand. Such secondary structural changes can be quantified using spectral deconvolution 27. SARS-CoV-2 S1 RBD underwent conformational change
in the presence of heparin (Figures 4 and 5), consisting of an increase in α-helix content of 1.5% and a decrease in global β-sheet of 2.1%. The observed changes demonstrate that the SARS-CoV-2 S1 RBD interacts with heparin in aqueous conditions of
physiological relevance. A chemically modified heparin derivative with the predominant repeating disaccharide structure; IdoA-GlNAc,6S, was able to induce closely
comparable secondary structural changes in the SARS-CoV-2 S1 RBD as heparin
(Figure 5, A - C). Analysis by CD spectroscopy of the role of chain length for heparinderived oligosaccharides (Figure 6, A - D) revealed that a hexasaccharide fraction
was able to induce similar conformational changes to heparin.
3.4 Heparin binding site analysis
Basic amino acids are known to dominate the binding between proteins and heparin.
With that in mind, primary sequence analysis of the expressed protein domain and
analysis of the modelled SARS-CoV-2 S1 RBD structure (Figure 7) were conducted
and indicated that there are several potential heparin binding sites and, importantly,
these patches of basic amino acids are exposed on the protein surface.
Analysis of the RBD sequence for potential heparin binding sites employing a metric
based on the Levenshtein distance (a measure of the similarity between two sequences) found that the basic amino acids sequences within SARS-CoV-2 S1 RBD
were similar to 278 sequences found in 309 heparin binding proteins. The predicted
heparin binding basic amino acid contain sequences are shown in Tables 2 and 3.
Basic amino acids with a normalised count greater than 0.5 were found at; RKR 355356 (0.941), LVK 533-535 (1.00), KK 557-558 (0.544) and R 557 (0.688). There were
also a number of possible secondary sites of interaction (a normalised count great

than 0.3); R 346 (0.368), R 403 (0.386), K 417 (0.309) and H 519 (0.305). One consequence of the ability of SARS-CoV-2 S1 RBD to interact with HS is that it provides
a route for adhering to cell surfaces, enabling invasion. Conversely, this region also
interacts with the orthodox receptor of the spike protein ACE2 (SARS-CoV-2 S1 RBD
436-529), suggesting that heparin and its derivatives interfere with the interactions
between the virus, via these residues. Furthermore, most of the identified sequences,
with 3 exceptions (TKLN, GKIADYNYKLP and PYRVVVL), are exposed on the protein
surface and available for binding.
Studying SARS-CoV-2 Spike protein structure and behaviour in solution is an important step in the development of effective therapeutics against SARS-CoV-2. Here,
the ability of the SARS-CoV-2 S1 RBD to bind pharmaceutical heparin, studied using
spectroscopic techniques, showed that SARS-CoV-2 S1 RBD binds to heparin and
that, upon binding, a significant conformational change is induced. Moreover, moieties
of basic amino acid residues that are common constituents of heparin binding domains, and accessible to solvent on the SARS-CoV-2 S1 RBD surface, form a continuous patch ((R454, R457, K458, K462, R466, R346, R355, K356 and R346 in Figure
7), suitable for heparin binding.
Comparison of the RBD amino acid sequence (residues 330-583) with an extensive
library of sequences from known heparin binding proteins (Tables 2 and 3) based on
the Levenstein Distance, which provides a measure of the degree of similarity between
the sequences, suggests that wider areas of the RBD surface may be available (Figure 7) for binding to host cell surface glycosaminoglycan polysaccharides. These may
relate to the propensity for the virus to select particular species, individuals and age
groups, since their GAG composition is known to vary. There is evidence of a potential
heparin-binding gain of function mutation (T346R) from the Bat-RaTG13 (Figure 7).

Discussion and Conclusion
The rapid spread of SARS-CoV-2 represents a significant challenge to global health
authorities and, since there are no currently approved drugs to treat, prevent and/or
mitigate its effects, repurposing existing drugs is both a timely and appealing strategy.
Heparin, a well-tolerated anticoagulant drug, has been used successfully for over 80
years with limited and manageable side effects. Furthermore, heparin belongs to a
unique class of pharmaceuticals for which effective antidotes are available, making it
safer to use.
Glycosaminoglycans are present on almost all mammalian cells and this class of carbohydrate is central to the strategy employed by the Coronaviridae to attach to host
cells. Heparin has previously been shown to inhibit SARS-associated coronavirus
strain HSR1 cell invasion 2 and its potential against SARS-CoV-2 represented an attractive possibility.
The observation that heparin is able to inhibit invasion by SARS-CoV-2, in a dosedependent manner at concentrations from 6.25 - 200 μg.ml-1, up to 80% in Vero cells
is a significant finding that offers one potential route for prophylaxis, as well as highlighting the capacity of this class of biological macromolecule to intervene in microbial,
particularly viral, infection. This ability, in addition to useful properties as anticoagulants and moderators of inflammation, remains under-studied and under-exploited, but

offers potential for intervention in many microbial interactions, not least those relating
to emerging viral diseases.
The dependence on particular structural features of the heparin scaffold, the resulting
changes in conformation of the spike protein RBD and the prediction of heparin-binding features all provide evidence that the interaction with heparin involves a level of
structural specificity. They also suggest that heparin, a complex mixture of polysaccharides, contains a range of activities that have the potential of being separated, with
or without further modification, to provide diverse derivatives that provide a range of
properties that can be tailored to suit a variety of clinical circumstances.
Heparin and its derivatives are amenable to routine parenteral administration through
currently established routes and additionally, directly to the respiratory tract via nasal
administration, using nebulised heparin, which would be unlikely to gain significant
access to the circulation. Thus, the anticoagulant activity of heparin which can, in any
event, be engineered out through suitable chemical modification, would not pose a
problem. Importantly, such a route of administration would be suitable for prophylaxis
and also for patients under mechanical ventilation 28.
Together, these data support the use of GAG-derived pharmaceuticals against SARSassociated coronavirus. Furthermore, this study supports the repurposing of heparin
and its derivatives as antiviral agents, to provide a rapid countermeasure against the
current SARS-CoV-2 outbreak and future emerging viral diseases.

The effect of unfractionated porcine mucosal heparin (from 200 μg.ml-1) added one hour before the infection of Vero cells with 50 PFU of SARS-CoV-2 or SARS-CoV. Nil represents no
treatment. The results are expressed as number of PFU per well and represent the mean ±
SD of quadruplicate cultures. The p value was calculated using the Mann-Whitney U test.

Figure 3. Competition for SARS-CoV-2 S1 RBD binding to immobilised heparin with
model heparin-derived oligo- and polysaccharides. 100 nM SARS-CoV-2 S1 RBD was
injected onto the surface in the presence or absence of the indicated concentration of heparinderived oligo- and polysaccharides. Since the SARS-CoV-2 S1 RBD does not dissociate appreciably when the system returns to PBST, this is when the response was measured, to avoid
any confounding effects of differences of refractive index between samples. A control measurement (100 nM SARS-CoV-2 S1 RBD alone) was performed before each competition and
used to calculate the percentage of maximum binding. This ensured that small changes over
time in the responsiveness of the surface did not cofound the analysis. (A) Competition for
100 nM SARS-CoV-2 S1 RBD binding to immobilised heparin by heparin and by enoxaparin.
(B) Competition for 100 nM SARS-CoV-2 S1 RBD binding to immobilised heparin by 0.17

Table 3. Predicted heparin binding domains in SARS-CoV-2 S1 RBD (330-583). The
amino acid sequence, number and normalized count for similar short, heparin binding sequences in the SARS-CoV-2 RBD found in a library of 776 heparin binding proteins. In addition
to SARS-CoV-2. The table also contains the aligned sequences from similar viruses, SARSCoV and related bat viruses. The predicted heparin binding regions are shown in yellow and
variations within those regions between SARS-CoV-2 and the related viruses are highlighted
in red.
