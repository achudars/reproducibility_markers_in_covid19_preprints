Abstract
The legal and illegal trade in wildlife for food, medicine and other products is a globally significant
threat to biodiversity that is also responsible for the emergence of pathogens that threaten human
and livestock health and our global economy. Trade in wildlife likely played a role in the origin of
COVID-19, and viruses closely related to SARS-CoV-2 have been identified in bats and pangolins, both
traded widely. To investigate the possible role of pangolins as a source of potential zoonoses, we
collected throat and rectal swabs from 334 Sunda pangolins (Manis javanica) confiscated in
Peninsular Malaysia and Sabah between August 2009 and March 2019. Total nucleic acid was
extracted for viral molecular screening using conventional PCR protocols used to routinely identify
known and novel viruses in extensive prior sampling (>50,000 mammals). No sample yielded a
positive PCR result for any of the targeted viral families – Coronaviridae, Filoviridae, Flaviviridae,
Orthomyxoviridae and Paramyxoviridae. In light of recent reports of coronaviruses including a SARSCoV-2 related virus in Sunda pangolins in China, the lack of any coronavirus detection in our
‘upstream’ market chain samples suggests that these detections in ‘downstream’ animals more
plausibly reflect exposure to infected humans, wildlife or other animals within the wildlife trade
network. While confirmatory serologic studies are needed, it is likely that Sunda pangolins are
incidental hosts of coronaviruses. Our findings further support the importance of ending the trade in
wildlife globally.
Introduction
The legal and illegal trade in wildlife for consumption as food, medicine and other products is a
globally significant threat to conservation ( Smith et al., 2006; Nayar, 2009; Rosen and Smith, 2010).
It also drives the emergence of pathogens that threaten human and domestic animal health, and
national and global economies (Lee and McKibbin, 2004; Smith et al., 2008; Smith et al., 2009). This

includes the 2003 Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) outbreak caused by SARS coronavirus
(SARS-CoV), which originated in the large wet markets of Guangdong province, China (Ksiazek et al.,
2003), and the current COVID-19 outbreak caused by SARS-CoV-2, first discovered in people
associated with a wet market in Wuhan (Zhou et al., 2020; Zhu et al., 2020). Both viruses likely
originated in bats, with SARS-CoV infecting civets and other small mammals in the markets which
may have acted as intermediate or amplifying hosts (Guan et al., 2003; Wang and Eaton, 2007). The
finding of furin cleavage insertions in the spike (s) protein sequence in the SARS-CoV-2 genome has
led some to suggest that intermediate hosts may have been involved in the emergence of COVID-19
(Andersen et al., 2020), however no intermediate hosts have so far been conclusively identified.
Recently, four different groups have identified coronaviruses in imported Sunda or Malayan
pangolins (Manis javanica) seized in raids on wildlife traders in China ( Liu et al., 2019; Lam et al.,
2020; Xiao et al., 2020; Zhang et al., 2020). The genomes of these are closely related to SARS-CoV-2,
particularly in some genes, including the s-gene responsible for binding to host cells, albeit that
some bat-CoVs have higher overall sequence identity to SARS-CoV-2 (Latinne et al., 2020). Authors of
these papers propose that further sampling of pangolins might help elucidate the potential role of
pangolins in the evolution of SARSr-CoVs, the emergence of COVID-19, and the risk of future
zoonotic viral emergence (Liu et al., 2020; Lam et al., 2020; Xiao et al., 2020).
Over a ten-year period, as part of the USAID PREDICT project (PREDICT Consortium, 2017; PREDICT
Consortium, 2019), we collected biological samples from confiscated and rescued Sunda pangolins in
their country-of-origin: Peninsular Malaysia and the Malaysian state of Sabah on the island of
Borneo. The aims of this study were to identify the phylogeographic origins of confiscated pangolins
and any potentially zoonotic pathogens associated with them (Karesh 2010). Here we report on the
results from pathogen surveillance and discovery screening of these pangolin samples.
Materials & methods
Sunda pangolins (Manis javanica) were either confiscated from smugglers or rescued from the wild
between August 2009 and March 2019, and were in the possession of the Department of Wildlife
and National Parks Peninsular Malaysia, or Sabah Wildlife Department at the time of sampling. Most
confiscations occurred near national borders or ports, and were reported to be destined for other
Southeast Asian countries en route to China, and were usually found in sacks or crates in temporary
holding facilities, or in vehicles. The wild-rescued Sunda pangolins were all surrendered by members
of the public who found them in their native habitats. All pangolins were alive during the sampling
process, based on their weakened condition the animals had been in captivity for varying lengths of
time, but usually many weeks or months, there was no way of confirming this.
The sampling protocol was approved by UC DAVIS Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee
(protocol number: 16048). Each pangolin was assigned a unique identification code, GPS coordinates
of the confiscation or rescue locations, biometric measurement and physical health check
information were recorded. Swab samples were collected from the throat and rectum using a sterile
non-absorbent mini-tip polyester swab (Puritan, Guilford, USA) placed in a cryotube contained 600
μL of TRIzol reagent (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, USA). All samples were stored immediately in a liquid
nitrogen dewar MVE Doble 34 (Chart Biomed, Ball Ground, USA) at the sampling site and transferred
to a -80°C freezer for long term storage.
Total nucleic acid was extracted for viral molecular screening using the NUCLISENS EASYMAG or
MINIMAG system according to the manufacturer’s protocol with validated modifications
(bioMérieux, Marcy l'Etoile, France). Complementary DNA (cDNA) of each sample were generated,
according to manufacturer’s protocol with random hexamers, from the SuperScript III First-Strand

Synthesis System for reverse transcription PCR (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, USA). The cDNA was used in
conventional PCR protocols screening five viral families: Coronaviridae, Filoviridae, Flaviviridae,
Orthomyxoviridae and Paramyxoviridae (Table 1). The PCRs were conducted in a Veriti or SimpliAmp
thermal cycler (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, USA). Reactions were carried out in a final volume of
20 µl, following the manufacturer’s protocol (Qiagen, Hilden, Germany) using 1 µl of the cDNA
product as template and either Fast Cycling PCR kit or HotStarTaq Plus Master Mix with a final
concentration of 0.1 µM for each primer following the manufacturer’s protocols (Qiagen, Hilden,
Germany). PREDICT universal controls 1 and 2 (Anthony et al., 2013), and specific controls for
Filovirus (One Health Institute Laboratory, University of California, Davis) and Influenza Liang PCR
(Liang et al., unpublished) were used. Peninsular Malaysia and Sabah samples were screened on
separate occasions at two different certified BSL2 biocontainment level laboratories using
standardised methods. PCR products were loaded and run on 1% agarose gel electrophoresis - 100V,
for 30-45 minutes with 0.5x tris-acetate-EDTA buffer (Vivantis Technologies Sdn. Bhd., Subang Jaya,
Malaysia). The gels were viewed on a transilluminator and expected size bands were excised, stored
in separate microcentrifuge tubes, and the corresponding post PCR mixes were used as a template
for contamination control PCRs to check for contamination from the universal positive controls. PCR
products were run under the same gel electrophoresis conditions; those without the expected size
bands showed that there was no contamination from the controls. Products from the initial PCR of
these samples were then purified using the Ultrafree-DA centrifugal filter units (Millipore, Cork,
Ireland); the purified products were cloned using the dual-colour selection Strataclone PCR cloning
kit according to the manufacturer’s protocol (Stratagene, La Jolla, USA). Up to eight colonies
containing the PCR product were selected and inoculated on Luria Bertani agar slants, individually.
Grown colonies were sent to a commercial company for direct colony sequencing.
Results
A total of 334 Sunda pangolins were screened: 289 in Peninsular Malaysia (confiscated n=286; wildrescued n=3) (Tables 2a and 2b), and 45 in Sabah state (confiscated n=40; wild-rescued n=5) (Tables
2c and 2d). No sample yielded a positive PCR result for any member of the targeted virus families,
either in Peninsular Malaysia (95% CI 0.0-0.01) or in Sabah (95% CI 0.0-0.08). All positive controls
were successfully amplified, confirming that the PCRs were performing properly.
Discussion
Our negative findings across five viral families associated with emerging and re-emerging zoonotic
diseases in recent decades contrast with reports of the detection of parainfluenza virus (Wang et al.,
2018), coronaviruses and Sendai virus (Liu et al., 2019; Zhang et al., 2020), and SARSr-CoVs (Lam et
al., 2020; Xiao et al., 2020) in Sunda pangolins. Our sample size is substantial, particularly given the
rarity of these animals in Malaysia - the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) lists
the Sunda pangolin (Manis javanica) as ‘Critically Endangered’, as a result of poaching, smuggling
and habitat loss (IUCN, 2018). Our previous studies of bat coronaviruses revealed 5-10% PCR
prevalence (Yang et al., 2016; Anthony et al., 2017; Hu et al., 2017; Latinne et al., 2020), suggesting
that even at the upper limit of the 95% confidence interval, our negative findings in pangolins are
inconsistent with endemic coronavirus infection at a population level. Serologic studies are needed
to support this contention.
While our sampling was necessarily opportunistic (given the conservation status and the cryptic
nature of the species) and sampling intensity varied, our negative findings over ten years and at
multiple locations supports the veracity of the findings. The most parsimonious explanation for the
contrast between our findings and the discovery of SARSr-CoVs in Sunda pangolins by (Liu et al.,
2019; Liu et al., 2020; Lam et al., 2020, Xiao et al., 2020, Zhang et al., 2020) is the nature of the

sampled population: our samples were drawn from an ‘upstream’ cohort of animals yet to enter or
just entering the illegal trade network, whereas all others were drawn from ‘downstream’ cohorts
confiscated at their destination in China. During the wildlife trade transits, which often includes
movement through other Southeast Asian countries, animals are often housed together in groups
from disparate geographic regions, and often with other species, giving opportunity for viral
transmission among and within species. The housing of some of the animals in rehabilitation centers
in China would also allow for exposure to coronaviruses from other groups or species. In natural
wildlife reservoir hosts, SARSr-CoVs appear to cause little if any clinical signs, and this is supported
by the limited laboratory infections so far carried out (Watanabe et al., 2010). The reports of clinical
illness and pathology associated with coronavirus infection in pangolins (Liu et al., 2019; Xiao et al.,
2020), are unlikely in a reservoir host. We therefore conclude that the detections of SARS-CoV-2
related viruses in pangolins are more plausibly a result of their exposure to infected people, wildlife
or other animals after they entered the trade network. Thus, the likelihood is that Sunda pangolins
are incidental rather than reservoir hosts of coronaviruses as claimed by Zhang et al., (2020).
Our microsatellite DNA fragment analysis (manuscript in preparation) suggests that confiscated
pangolins from Peninsular Malaysia and Sabah were taken from Malaysia, Brunei or Indonesia,
however further analysis of pangolins from the neighbouring countries is required to confirm the
results. They were confiscated at holding facilities, ports or borders prior to shipment, and had not
yet been exposed to multiple potential sources of infection, unlike the confiscated animals in China
reported by Xiao et al., (2020) and Lam et al., (2020). An array of pathogens and infections have
been observed in wet markets, in wildlife (Dong et al., 2007; Cantlay et al., 2017), in humans (Xu et
al., 2004) and in domestic animals (Karesh et al., 2005). In comparison to wildlife screened from the
wild (Poon et al., 2004) and from farms (Tu et al., 2004; Kan et al., 2005), wildlife in markets have a
much higher chance of exposure to pathogens and disease spillover. These findings highlight the
importance of carefully and systemically ending the trade in wildlife and improving biosecurity to
avoid having wet markets where wild animals are mixing with farmed animals and humans.
Our findings suggest that pangolins that have not entered the illegal wildlife trade pose no threat to
human health. While the detection of SARS-CoV-2 like viruses in some trade-rescued pangolins
suggests a parallel with traded civets (Parguma larvata) in the emergence of SARS-CoV (Guan et al.,
2003), any role as an intermediate host in the transmission of SARS-CoV-2 from a putative natural
bat host to humans is yet to be established. Serological studies in pre-trade pangolins will shed
further light on any role of pangolins as hosts of SARS CoV2-related viruses. All pangolin species face
known and significant threats to their survival in nature and require active conservation efforts to
ensure their enduring existence for future generations.
