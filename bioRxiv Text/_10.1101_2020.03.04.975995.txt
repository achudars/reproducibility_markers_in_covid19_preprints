Abstract
Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) and severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS)-related
coronaviruses (e.g., 2019-nCoV and SARS-CoV) are phylogenetically distantly related, but both are
capable of infecting human hosts via the same receptor, angiotensin-converting enzyme 2, and cause
similar clinical and pathological features, suggesting their phenotypic convergence. Yet, the molecular
basis that underlies their phenotypic convergence remains unknown. Here, we used a recently
developed molecular phyloecological approach to examine the molecular basis leading to their
phenotypic convergence. Our genome-level analyses show that the spike protein, which is responsible
for receptor binding, has undergone significant Darwinian selection along the branches related to 2019nCoV and SARS-CoV. Further examination shows an unusually high proportion of evolutionary
convergent amino acid sites in the receptor binding domain (RBD) of the spike protein between COVID19 and SARS-related CoV clades, leading to the phylogenetic uniting of their RBD protein sequences. In
addition to the spike protein, we also find the evolutionary convergence of its partner protein, ORF3a,
suggesting their possible co-evolutionary convergence. Our results demonstrate a strong adaptive
evolutionary convergence between COVID-19 and SARS-related CoV, possibly facilitating their
adaptation to similar or identical receptors. Finally, it should be noted that many observed bat SARS-like
CoVs that have an evolutionary convergent RBD sequence with 2019-nCoV and SARS-CoV may be preadapted to human host receptor ACE2, and hence would be potential new coronavirus sources to infect
humans in the future.

Introduction
The 2019 novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV, also called severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS)-CoV-2)
has caused the current outbreak of coronavirus disease (COVID-19), which has emerged as a serious
public health concern. The clinical and pathological features caused by 2019-nCoV resemble those seen
in SARS 1-3, which is caused by SARS coronavirus (SARS-CoV). Both 2019-nCoV and SARS-CoV have been
determined to be of bat origin, with possible intermediate hosts prior to infecting humans 4,5.
Phylogenetic studies have shown that 2019-nCoV and SARS-CoV belong to the subgenus Sarbecovirus,
but they are distantly related 5-8, with a sequence identity of 79.6% at the whole-genome level 5. One
recent study showed that 2019-nCoV is more similar to a bat coronavirus (RaTG13), with a sequence
identity of 96.2% at the whole-genome level, than many other coronaviruses from different hosts,
suggesting a phylogenetic affinity of 2019-nCoV to bat coronavirus compared with SARS-CoV 5. Despite

their relatively distant phylogenetic relationships, 2019-nCoV and SARS-CoV are both known to be
capable of infecting humans using the same cell receptor, angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) 5,6,9,10,
and their protein structures of receptor-binding protein spike (S) are found to be highly similar to each
other 10,11, suggesting their phenotypic convergence. The spike protein is responsible for receptor
binding and membrane fusion, and it is important for host tropism and transmission capacity 6. The
spike protein of coronaviruses comprises two subunits, S1 and S2. The S1 subunit contains a receptorbinding domain (RBD), which harbors a receptor-binding motif (RBM) to make complete contact with
the receptor (i.e., ACE2) 12,13.
Considering that 2019-nCoV and SARS-CoV are distantly related, but show high similarity in the RBD
protein structure and can use the same cell receptor, ACE2 5-11, an evolutionary convergence may have
occurred between them. In the present study, we employ a recently developed molecular
phyloecological approach 14-16, which uses a comparative phylogenetic analysis of functional gene
sequences to determine the genetic basis of phenotypic evolution, and we examine the possible
molecular basis underlying the phenotypic convergence between 2019-nCoV and SARS-CoV. Our results
reveal positive selection signals and evolutionary convergent amino acid sites of the spike protein in
both 2019-nCoV and SARS-CoV and their related coronaviruses, providing new insights into
understanding the evolutionary origin of their phenotypic convergence.

Results and discussion
We used likelihood ratio tests based on the branch and branch-site models implemented in the codeml
program of PAML 17 to examine the possible Darwinian selection of all 11 genes annotated in the 2019nCoV genome (NC_045512). Positively selected genes (PSGs) were found by the branch-site model
(Table 1), independent of the initial value variation of parameters (kappa and ω). Specifically, for the
branches leading to 2019-nCoV and SARS-CoV, no PSGs were found, nor were PSGs found along the
branches leading to their sister coronaviruses. However, we detected PSGs along the ancestral branch
(branch C) of 2019-nCoV and its sister taxon, RaTG13, as well as along the ancestral branch (branch K) of
SARS-CoV and its sister taxa, WIV16 and Rs4231 (Table 1, Fig. 1). For branch C, three PSGs (S, Orf1ab and
N) were found, and for branch K, only one gene (S) was found to be under positive selection (Table 1).
Orf1ab encodes replicase and N encodes nucleocapsid 18. Intriguingly, the S gene was subject to
Darwinian selection in both branches, C and K. This gene encodes the spike protein, which mediates
receptor binding and membrane fusion 6. The finding of Darwinian selection on the spike protein may
suggest its adaptive evolution to the host receptors. To further examine the possible adaptive evolution
of 2019-nCoV and SARS-CoV to a human host, we used RELAX 19 to analyze the relative selection
intensity change of the 11 genes along the branches leading to 2019-nCoV and SARS-CoV compared with
their most recent ancestors, branches C and K, respectively (Tables S1-2). Among the 11 genes examined,
gene S along the 2019-nCoV branch exhibited a significant selection intensification signal (K = 30.54, p =
0.000, Table S1, Fig. S1), and this remained robust in four independent runs. We also found that the
ORF6 gene showed slight selection intensification (K = 1.81, p = 0.000) along the SARS-CoV branch (Table
S2), while its statistical significance only received two supports among five independent runs. For the
selectively intensified gene S along the 2019-nCoV branch, 0.46% of the amino acid sites (about five
amino acids) were under positive selection, while most sites (86.63%) were under purification selection

(Table S1). This may suggest that 2019-nCoV was subject to an adaptive evolution during its adaption to
possible intermediate and/or human hosts.
Given the positive selection of the S gene in both branches, C and K, we further examined its positive
selection signals using branch-site model along all other main branches (Fig. 1) to test whether the
positive selection uniquely occurred along the branches related to 2019-nCoV and SARS-CoV. Our results
showed positive selection signals along 10 out of 45 branches examined (Fig. 1, Table S3). This may
suggest that the S gene was widely subject to Darwinian selection in different coronavirus strains,
indicating that it may be crucial for the successful survival of coronaviruses. Further analyses of positive
selection sites showed that most positive selection sites among all 12 branches under positive selection
were located within subunit 1 of S gene (Table 1, Table S3), which is used for receptor binding. This may
suggest that there are strong selection pressures of different coronavirus strains for their own receptor
binding.
Given the selection intensification of S gene in 2019-nCoV since its evolutionary divergence from
RaTG13, we conducted comparative sequence analyses between the two. We found that there were
more than 20 amino acid differences between them, and most of them were located within RBD,
especially RBM (Fig. S2), suggesting a high variability of RBM. Given the importance of RBM for receptor
binding, we further conducted a comparative sequence analysis among all the coronavirus strains
studied to examine its variability. The results showed high sequence variability, with insertion and/or
deletion and amino acid substitutions among the coronavirus strains studied (Fig. 2). Despite the high
variability of RBM, strikingly, we found that SARS-CoV and its phylogenetic relatives—including WIV16
(KT444582), Rs4231 (KY417146), Rs7327 (KY417151), Rs9401 (KY417152), and BtRs-BetaCoV/YN2018B
(MK211376), called SARS-related CoV here, shared many identical or nearly identical amino acids with
their phylogenetically distant coronavirus strains, including 2019-nCoV and RaTG13, which we called
COVID-19-related CoV (Fig. 2). These shared amino acids were clearly distinct from bat SARS-like CoV
that were phylogenetic intermediates between them (Fig. 2). Further analyses showed that such
identical amino acids shared between SARS-related CoV and COVID-19-related CoV were not restricted
to RBM, but rather, they were scattered throughout the spike protein, with a total of 32 such sites,
which were centered on RBD (28 sites in total, Fig. S3). To further examine whether such similarity
occurred in other proteins, we analyzed all 11 genes studied among these coronaviruses, and we found
that one additional gene, ORF3a, contained eight such sites (Fig. 1). The existence of these shared
amino acids between SARS-related CoV and COVID-19-related CoV may suggest their high sequence
similarity. In support of this, we reconstructed maximum likelihood and neighbor-joining phylogenies
using full-length RBD protein sequences, and both showed that SARS-related CoV and COVID-19-related
CoV were grouped in the same clade, with relatively high support, which is consistent with two previous
studies 6,7, at the same time, their phylogenetic intermediates were clustered in distinct clades (Fig. 3,
Fig. S4). The phylogenetic uniting of SARS-related CoV and COVID-19-related CoV provide evidence of
their high similarity of RBD protein sequences.
Given their genome-level phylogenetic disparity, the high similarity of RBD protein sequences between
SARS-related CoV and COVID-19-related CoV may suggest their evolutionary convergence in the spike
protein. To test this possibility, we used an empirical Bayes approach in PAML 17 to reconstruct ancestral

amino acid sequences along internal nodes, and our results showed there were up to 35 evolutionary
convergent sites, including 3 convergent and 32 parallel amino acid substitutions that were shared by
two ancestral branches leading to SARS-related CoV and COVID-19-related CoV, respectively (Fig. 1). It
should be noted that the 35 evolutionary convergent sites of spike protein were apparently
underestimated, since those amino acid sites with alignment gaps were not considered by the approach
used. Still, these 35 sites represented an unusually high incidence of evolutionary convergence sites,
which have rarely been found in previous studies related to molecular convergent evolution 20-26. This
suggests a strong evolutionary convergence between SARS-related CoV and COVID-19-related CoV. On
completion of our data analyses, one of the most recent studies showed that the RBD of the spike
protein of Pangolin-CoV is nearly identical to that of 2019-nCoV, with only one amino acid difference 27,
suggesting that Pangolin-CoV also belongs to the clade of COVID-19-related CoV. It should be noted that
the RBD sequences of two other coronavirus strains, BM48-31 (GU190215) and BtKY72 (KY352407),
were grouped with SARS-related CoV and COVID-19-related CoV (Fig. 3, Fig. S4), suggesting an
evolutionary convergence among them. In addition to these evolutionarily convergent coronavirus
strains, intriguingly, we found the evidence of evolutionary convergence of the spike protein between
the ancestral branch leading to SARS-related CoV and the ancestral branch of COVID-19-related CoV and
its sister strains (CoVZC45 and CoVZXC21), which harbored 9 evolutionary convergent amino acid sites
(Fig. S5). These results suggest that the spike protein may have been subjected to a successive
evolutionary convergence among ancestral coronavirus strains leading to SARS-related CoV, COVID-19related CoV and CoVZC45 and CoVZXC21.
Previous studies show that spike protein interacts tightly with a related protein ORF3a and they likely
coevolved 28-30. If their coevolution does occur, we may expect that the evolutionary convergence of the
spike protein found may have led to the occurrence of the evolutionary convergence of ORF3a as well.
To test this, we reconstructed ancestral amino acid sequences of ORF3a along internal nodes, and our
results revealed 6 parallel amino acid substitutions shared between the ancestral branch leading to
SARS-related CoV and the ancestral branch of COVID-19-related CoV and its sister strains (CoVZC45 and
CoVZXC21) (Fig. S5). And we also detected a parallel amino acid substitution of ORF3a between the two
ancestral branches leading to SARS-related CoV and COVID-19-related CoV (Fig. S6). Considering that
these evolutionary convergent branches of ORF3a also showed evolutionary convergence in spike
protein as mentioned above (Fig. 1, Fig. S5), it may suggest that spike protein and its partner protein
ORF3a may have been subjected to a co-evolutionary convergence.
Evolutionary convergence may occur by chance or by Darwinian selection. Our results showed that the
evolutionary convergent sites found in this study were mainly restricted to two genes (S and ORF3a, Fig.
1), and in particular, they were centered within the RBD of the S gene. This biased distribution of
evolutionary convergent sites is difficult to explain according to chance; rather, Darwinian selection
would be favored as a plausible explanation. In support of this, we used CONVERG2 31 to evaluate the
probability of the occurrence of our observed convergent sites of spike protein between the two
ancestral branches leading to SARS-related CoV and COVID-19-related CoV, and the results showed high
statistical significance (p = 0.000000), regardless of whether the JTT model or Poisson model was used.
This result apparently rejects chance or neutral evolution as a possible explanation; rather, it indicates a

predominately strong Darwinian selection. Moreover, we observed an apparently accelerated evolution
of RBD of SARS-related CoV and COVID-19-related CoV related to their phylogenetic intermediates (Fig.
3), and we detected a significant Darwinian selection of the S gene along two branches (branches C and
K) of SARS-related CoV and COVID-19-related CoV (Fig. 1, Table 1). These lines of evidence may strongly
support the evolutionary convergence found in this study as a result of adaptive evolution. Regarding
the possible adaptive evolutionary convergence, previously proposed causes, such as gene duplication
and horizontal gene transfer 21,32,33, are less likely because only single-copy S genes were found in all 35
genomes examined and evolutionary convergent sites presented an apparently biased distribution
pattern. Parallel and/convergent evolution, which occur through point mutation, could contribute to our
observed evolutionary convergence, but it could not account for the unusually high incidence of
convergent sites observed in this study, representing a rare finding in previous studies 20-26. Recent
studies have shown a relatively high likelihood of occurrence of homologous recombination in spike
protein 7,34,35 , and especially, it is considered that the RBD of 2019-nCov may be derived from a
recombination event between that of human SARS-CoV and another (unsampled) SARS-like CoV 35. If
this is the case, the homologous recombination, if any, may have occurred between the ancestors
(branches C and K) of SARS-related CoV and COVID-19-related CoV, accounting for their unusually high
incidence of convergent sites observed in this study.
Given the strong evolutionary convergence of RBD of spike protein between the two clades, COVID-19related CoV and SARS-related CoV, the coronaviruses of the two clades may have more likely adapted to
similar or the same receptor. To date, 2019-nCoV and SARS-CoV have been known to be capable of
using the ACE2 receptor in human host 5,6,9,10, but the receptors of their phylogenetic relatives from the
two clades, COVID-19-related CoV and SARS-related CoV, are less clear 4,5,36,37. Regarding the bat SARSlike CoV, Rs4231 and Rs7327 are known to be able to use human ACE2 receptor 37, while WIV16 is
capable of using the ACE2 receptor from humans, civets and Chinese horseshoe bats (Rhinolophus
sinicus) 4. The receptors of Rs9401, BtRs-BetaCoV/YN2018B, and BatCoV RaTG13 remain to be explored.
Further studies on the receptors of these bat SARS-like CoVs in their natural reservoirs are badly needed
to determine whether ACE2 or other candidates, if any, represent their shared cell receptor, leading to
their strong evolutionary convergence of spike protein.
Our molecular phyloecological study demonstrates that spike protein shows significant Darwinian
selection along two ancestral branches related to SARS-CoV and 2019-nCoV, suggesting their adaptive
evolution to recognizing their own cell receptors. Comparative sequence and phylogenetic analyses
indicate a high similarity of RBD sequences of spike protein between SARS-related CoV and COVID-19related CoV. Subsequent ancestral sequence reconstruction and convergent evolution analyses reveal
an unusually high incidence of parallel and convergent amino acid substitutions between them,
suggesting an extremely strong adaptive evolutionary convergence in spike protein. In addition to spike
protein, we also found evolutionary convergence of its partner protein, ORF3a, suggesting their possible
co-evolutionary convergence. Finally, considering that SARS-CoV and 2019-nCoV have posed serious
concerns to public health and safety, it should be noted that many other bat SARS-like CoV strains that
were evolutionarily convergent with SARS-CoV and 2019-nCoV recognized in this study may be potential
novel coronaviruses to infect humans in the future.

Materials and method
Taxa and sequences
We used 35 coronavirus strain genomes of the subgenus Sarbecovirus based on two published studies 5,6,
including 2019-nCoV, SARS-CoV, and their phylogenetic relative, bat SARS-like CoV (please see Fig. 1 for
details). For all these coronavirus strains, we downloaded their full-length genome sequences from
GenBank except for five 2019-nCoV and RaTG13 strains, which were downloaded from GISAID. We
aligned these genome sequences using MAFFT (https://mafft.cbrc.jp/alignment/server/). The coding
sequences of 11 genes (Fig. 1) annotated in the genome of 2019-nCoV (NC_045512) were used as a
reference sequence to obtain the homologous gene sequences of the 35 coronavirus strains. We aligned
these homologous gene sequences using the online software webPRANK
(http://www.ebi.ac.uk/goldman-srv/webprank/) 38, which is considered to create a more reliable
alignment to decrease false-positive results in positive selection analyses 39.
Adaptive evolution analyses
We employed the branch and branch-site models implemented in the codeml program of PAML 17 to
examine the adaptive evolution of our focal genes. For this, a codon-based maximum-likelihood method
was used to estimate the ratio of non-synonymous to synonymous substitutions per site (dN/dS or ω),
and likelihood ratio tests (LRTs) were used to calculate statistical significance. A statistically significant
value of ω > 1 suggests positive selection. Upon analysis, an unrooted taxon tree (Fig. 1) was constructed
based on two published studies 5,6. For branch model analysis, we used a two-rate branch model, and
our focal branches were labelled as foreground branches, while others were treated as background
branches. The two-rate branch model was compared with the one-rate branch model, which assumes a
single ω value across the tree, to determine statistical significance. If a statistically significant value
of ω > 1 in a foreground branch was detected, the two-ratio branch model was then compared with the
two-ratio branch model with a constraint of ω = 1 to further determine whether the ω > 1 of the
foreground branch was statistically significant. In addition to the branch model, we also used a branchsite model (Test 2) to detect positively selected sites for a particular branch. Test 2 compares a modified
model A with its corresponding null model with a constraint of ω = 1 to determine the statistical
significance. Positively selected sites were found using an empirical Bayes method. For result robustness,
we evaluated the dependence of the signal of positive selection on parameter variation. For this, we
used two different initial values of kappa (kappa = 0.5, 3.0) and of omega (ω = 0.5, 2.0), and eventually,
several independent runs were conducted for each of the positively selected genes found.
Selection intensity analyses
We analyzed relative selection intensity using the RELAX 19 program, available from the Datamonkey
webserver (http://test.datamonkey.org/relax). RELAX is a hypothesis testing framework, and it can be
used to test whether selection strength has been relaxed or intensified along a certain branch or
lineage. For analyses, RELAX calculates a selection intensity parameter value (k), and k > 1 shows an
intensified selection, while k < 1 indicates a relaxed selection, assuming a priori partitioning of the test
branches and reference branches. We would expect that an intensified selection shows ω categories
away from neutrality (ω = 1), while a relaxed selection is expected to show ω categories converging to
neutrality (ω = 1). Statistical significance was evaluated by LRT by comparing an alternative model with

a null model. The null model assumes k = 1 and the same ω distribution for both test and reference
branches, while the alternative model assumes that k is a free parameter, and the test and reference
branches may have different ω distributions.
Phylogenetic analyses
We reconstructed an maximum likelihood (ML) tree and neighbor-joining (NJ) tree using MEGA X 40. For
ML analyses, the WAG+ G model was selected as the best amino acid substitution model according to
the Bayesian information criterion. All amino acid sites with an alignment gap were included for analyses.
For NJ analyses, JTT+G was selected as the best model. For the ML and NJ analyses, the bootstrap value
was set to 1, 000. Other parameters were used as defaults in the program.
Ancestral sequence reconstruction
We used the amino acid-based marginal reconstruction implemented in the empirical Bayes approach in
PAML 17 for ancestral sequence reconstruction. In the analyses, the character was assigned to a single
interior node and the character with the highest posterior probability was used as the best
reconstruction. We used two different amino acid substitution models, JTT and Poisson, to examine the
consistency of our results. The JTT model assumes different substitution rates of different amino acids,
while the Poisson model assumes the same substitution rate of all amino acids. For the analyses, we
obtained the full-length spike protein sequences of our focal coronavirus strains and used their
phylogeny, as given in Fig. 1. The amino acid substitutions along our focal branches were analyzed. The
results based on the JTT and Poisson models were generally identical; for convenience, only the results
based on the JTT model are shown.
Convergent evolution analyses
We used the CONVERG2 31 program to evaluate the probabilities that the observed convergent and
parallel substitutions were due to random chance. A statistical significant p-value may suggest the
observed evolutionary convergent sites are less likely attributable to random chance, but instead, favor
Darwinian selection as a possible explanation. For the analyses, two different amino acid substitution
models, JTT and Poisson, were used. The RBD amino acid sequences of our focal 35 coronavirus
genomes were abstracted and aligned using CLUSTAL W 41 program. The phylogenetic relationships
among the coronavirus strains studied are given in Fig. 1.

Fig. 1 The phylogeny of subgenus Sarbecovirus and 11 genes used in this study. The coronavirus
phylogeny follows two published studies 5,6. 2019-nCoV, 2019 novel coronavirus; SARS-CoV, severe
acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus; Bat-SL-CoV, bat-derived severe acute respiratory syndrome
(SARS)-like coronaviruses. Genomic organization and the 11 genes annotated in the reference genome
of 2019-nCoV (NC_045512) are shown. Red dots represent the numbers of identical or nearly identical
amino acid sites found in genes, S and ORF3a, which are shared between SARS-related CoV and COVID19-related CoV, but are completely or nearly completely distinct from those of their phylogenetic
intermediates. The spike (S) protein structure follows one previous study 12, and its receptor-binding
domain (RBD) and receptor-binding motif (RBM) are highlighted. * above branches and their
corresponding capital letters (A-L) denote the branches with positive selection signals found in the S
gene. Two branches (bold) indicate two evolutionary convergent branches with three convergent amino
acid substitutions (blue) and 32 shared parallel amino acid substitutions of spike protein.

Fig. S1 Selection intensity changes of gene S along the 2019- nCoV branch (test branch) compared with
the common ancestral branch (reference branch) of 2019 n-CoV and RaTG13. The result shows that the
ω categories of the test branch are apparently away from neutrality (ω = 1), indicating an intensified
selection along the 2019- nCoV branch.

Table S3 Branches under the positive selection of the S gene. Positive selections are analyzed using
branch-site model. For convenience, only the ω values of the foreground branches are shown. Positive
selection sites located in subunit 1 of the S gene are shown in grey. Underlining shows positive selected
sites located in the RBD.
