ABSTRACT
The COVID-19, caused by the novel coronavirus SARS-CoV-2, has broken out of
control all over the globe and put the majority of the world under lockdown. There have
been no specific antiviral medications for SARS-CoV-2 while vaccines are still under
development. Thus, rapid diagnosis and necessary public health measures are currently
key parts to contain the pandemic. Quantitative reverse transcription polymerase chain
reaction (qRT-PCR) is the gold standard method for SARS-CoV-2 detection. However,

this method is not suitable for point-of-care (POC) diagnosis because of the timeconsuming procedure, the requirements of biosafety conditions and expensive equipment.
In this study, the colorimetric isothermal nucleic acid amplification tests (iNAATs) for
SARS-CoV-2 based on loop-mediated isothermal amplification (LAMP), cross-priming
amplification (CPA), and polymerase spiral reaction (PSR) were developed and
compared. The three methods exhibited similar performance with the limit of detection
(LOD) as low as just 1 copy per reaction when evaluated on the synthetic DNA
fragments. The results can be read with naked eyes within 30 minutes without crossreactivity to closely related coronaviruses. When tested with SARS-CoV-2 extracted
genomic-RNA, LAMP outperformed both CPA and PSR assays. Moreover, the direct
detection of SARS-CoV-2 in simulated patient samples (oropharyngeal and
nasopharyngeal swabs) by colorimetric iNAATs was also successful. Further preparation
of the lyophilized reagents for LAMP reactions revealed that the freeze-dried, ready-touse kit maintained the sensitivity and LOD value of the liquid assays. These results
strongly indicate that the colorimetric lyophilized LAMP test kit developed herein is
highly suitable for detecting SARS-CoV-2 at POC.

INTRODUCTION
Coronavirus is a large family of RNA viruses, including the human coronavirus
229E, OC43, NL63, and HKU1, which often lead to respiratory illnesses with mild cold
symptoms [1, 2]. The two exceptions of human coronavirus that cause severe diseases
including the fatal Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus (SARS-CoV) [3]
and the Middle East Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus (MERS-CoV) [4] that caused
two global outbreaks in the last two decades. Very recently, the mortal pneumonia
disease caused by a novel a coronavirus called SARS-CoV-2, named "COVID-19" by the

World Health Organization (WHO), started in Wuhan, China and rapidly spread all over
the globe [5]. In March 2020, WHO has classified the COVID-19 outbreak as "Global
Pandemic" [6]. As of May 24th, 2020, COVID-19 has spread to over 210 countries and
regions worldwide with more than 5.4 million confirmed cases and 344,000 casualties
[7].
The diagnostic standard of SARS-CoV-2 involves clinical symptoms and molecular
methods. For an accurate diagnosis, the molecular methods include metagenomic nextgeneration sequencing (mNGS) and quantitative reverse transcription PCR (qRT-PCR)
are required. mNGS is the most precise technique, but it is extremely expensive, timeconsuming, and reliant on highly skillful personnel. qRT-PCR is sensitive for the
detection of SARS-CoV-2, which was introduced by WHO [8]. The test can be carried
out using respiratory samples such as nasopharyngeal or oropharyngeal swabs, which is
currently widely used as the gold standard method for SARS-Cov-2 diagnosis.
Nevertheless, qRT-PCR requires high-cost equipment and results are only available
within a few hours to 2 days, limiting its application at resource-limited settings.
Different virological and serological approaches for rapidly detecting SARS-CoV-2
at POC have been introduced. Virological diagnosis directly detects the viral nucleic
acids via isothermal nucleic

acid amplification tests (iNAATs) [9-12] and

CRISPR Cas12 based method [13]. Serological tests detect the rising titers of antibody
between acute and convalescent stages of infection or detect IgM in primary infection
[14-17]. However, serological diagnosis usually shows lower sensitivity especially in the
early stage of infection [18]. Meanwhile, like PCR, iNAATs that amplify the viral nucleic
acids at a constant temperature are expected to determine the presence of infectious
viruses even in the patient without clinical symptoms. Loop-mediated isothermal
amplification (LAMP) was introduced in 2000 and broadly utilized nowadays [19].
LAMP was shown to be rapid, specific, and remarkably sensitive compared to

conventional PCR [20, 21]. LAMP uses only one kind of DNA polymerase possessing
the strand displacement activity and no modified/labeled DNA probes, simplifying the
preparation procedure and significantly saving the cost [22]. Other isothermal DNA
amplification methods developed later, which also depend on the use of a DNA
polymerase strand displacement activity, include cross-priming amplification (CPA) [23,
24] and polymerase spiral reaction (PSR) [25]. While LAMP requires two to three primer
pairs, PSR needs only one primer pair, and CPA uses multiple cross-linked primers (six
to eight primers). CPA and PSR amplicon can also be visualized via detection methods
that have been used for LAMP, such as using SyBr Green or a pH-sensitive indicator
[26]. Both PSR and CPA methods have similar benefits to LAMP,

including easy

operation, low-cost equipment, and simple and fast readout of the results, which makes
them ideal for resource-restricted settings. Various studies indicated that PSR and CPA
performance regarding sensitivity and specificity was comparable to that of LAMP [2731].
In this study, we developed and compared colorimetric LAMP, CPA, and PSR for
SARS-CoV-2 utilizing a pH-sensitive dye for readout visualization. LAMP exhibited the
best LOD value with respect to the identification of SARS-CoV-2 viral genomic-RNA.
The ready-to-use lyophilized LAMP kit could detect SARS-CoV-2 genomic-RNA
directly in clinical samples, which is suitable and convenient for POC diagnostics.
MATERIALS AND METHODS
Primer design
Primers for LAMP, CPA, and PSR assays targeting the N and Orf1ab sequences of
SARS-CoV-2 (GenBank accession number MN908947) were designed using the free
online software Primer Explorer V5 (https://primerexplorer.jp/e/). Primer selection was
carried out as instructed (https://primerexplorer.jp/e/v4_manual/). Two sets of primer

pairs for LAMP (targeting the N and Orf1ab genes), two sets of primer pairs for PSR
(targeting the N and Orf1ab genes), and one set of primer pairs for CPA (targeting the
Orf1ab gene) were selected. Primers were synthesized by Phu Sa Biochem (Can Tho,
Vietnam) and their sequences are listed in Table 1.
Synthesized DNA template preparation
The sequences from 282740 - 28516 of the N gene and from 2853 - 2452 of the
Orf1ab gene of SARS-CoV-2 (GenBank MN908947) were selected to serve as the
control templates for iNAATs. The N and Orf1ab sequences were obtained from Phu Sa
Biochem, (Can Tho, Vietnam). The DNA templates of MERS-CoV, SARS-CoV, and bat
SARS-like-CoV were prepared similarly. The sequences of synthesized DNA templates
are listed in Table 1.
Primer specificity analysis
The reference genomes of SARS-CoV-2 and related species were downloaded from
NCBI (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov). The primer sequences were aligned to genomes of
different coronaviruses to calculate the number of mismatches using Geneious Prime
2020.0.3 (https://www.geneious.com). The percentage of mismatch was calculated by
dividing the total number of different bases between primers and genome sequences to
the

total

length

of

primers.

The

software

FastPCR

available

at

http://primerdigital.com/fastpcr.html was used for in silico PCR analysis.
Viral RNA preparation
The genomic RNA of SASR-CoV-2 was prepared in a biosafety level 3 laboratory
in Pasteur Institute, Ho Chi Minh City, Vietnam. Vero E6 cells were infected with SARSCoV-2 isolated from the oropharyngeal swab samples of COVID-19 patients in Vietnam

[32, 33]. After 72 h of infection, the virus culture was collected and heated at 65 °C for 1
h. Viral genomic-RNA was isolated using the QIAamp viral RNA extraction Kit (Qiagen,
Hilden, German) following the manufacturer’s instruction. The copy number of extracted
genomic RNAs of SASR-CoV-2 was calculated using the standard curve based on qRTPCR Ct-value as described in the previous study [33].
Collection and preparation of clinical specimens
Nasopharyngeal and oropharyngeal swab specimens from volunteer nurses and
doctors were collected at a local hospital (Ho Chi Minh City, Vietnam). The volunteers
had been already diagnosed negative with SARS-CoV-2 by qRT-PCR. All participants
gave their informed consent to participate. Oropharyngeal and nasopharyngeal specimens
were collected using a sterile flocked plastic swab which was then soaked into 400 µl of
nuclease-free water. Fresh samples were kept on ice until analysis or frozen for
subsequent assays.
To prepare the simulated clinical specimens, various concentrations of SARS-CoV2 synthesized DNA or extracted viral genomic-RNA were spiked into the nasopharyngeal
and oropharyngeal swab collected. Next, the simulated swab samples containing the
spiked synthetic-DNA were 10-fold diluted in the nuclease-free water and 1 µl of the
diluted sample was added to the iNAAT reactions. The simulated swab samples
containing the viral RNA were 50-fold diluted in the nuclease-free water and 5 µl of the
diluted sample were added to the LAMP reactions. Non-spiked specimens were used as
negative samples.
Ethical statement
The sample collection was approved by Hospital Management. The internal use of
samples was agreed under the medical and ethical rules of each participating individuals.

PCR assays
The PCR assays were carried out in a 20 μl reaction volume containing 0.2 μM each

of primers F3 and B3 (LAMP), 1 μl of DNA template, 0.2 µl of MyTaq DNA polymerase
(Bioline, London, UK) and 4 µl of 5X MyTaq reaction buffer (Bioline, London, UK).
The amplification products were analyzed by electrophoresis using a 2% agarose gel.
Colorimetric iNAATs
WarmStart® Colorimetric LAMP 2X Master Mix (DNA & RNA) was purchased
from NEB (MA, USA). The iNAAT reaction volume was 15 μl consisting of 1 or 5 μl of

template sample and 7.5 μl of Colorimetric Mastermix. The LAMP reaction contains 0.8

μM each inner primer (FIP and BIP), 0.1 μM each outer primer (F3 and B3), 0.2 μM each
loop primer (FLoop and Bloop). The CPA reaction contains 0.5 µM cross primer 1s, 0.3

µM each of primers 3a and 2a, 0.05 µM each of displacement primers 4s and 5a. The
PSR reaction contains 1.6 µM each primer (PSR-F and PSR-R). The iNAAT reactions
were run in BioSan Dry block thermostat Bio TDB-100 for 30 to 45 minutes (min) at 60
°C for LAMP and 63 °C for CPA and PSR reactions. The amplification products were
detected by the color shifting from red to yellow of the test reaction, which is based on
the use of phenol red, a pH-sensitive indicator as instructed by the manufacturer. The
products were also analyzed by electrophoresis on a 2% agarose gel when necessary.
Optimization of Colorimetric iNAATs
One nanogram of the synthesized DNA template was used to perform the
optimization experiment. Regarding the identification of optimal incubation time, the
iNAAT reactions were incubated from 5 to 70 min at 60 °C for LAMP and 63 °C for
CPA and PSR reactions. As for temperature optimization, the reaction mixtures were
incubated at different temperatures from 50 °C to 70 °C for 30 min.

Evaluation of LOD of Colorimetric iNAATs
The iNAAT reactions were carried out in the duration and at the temperature
optimized using synthetic-DNA templates. The copy number of the synthetic DNA
template

was

calculated

using

Endmemo

program

(http://endmemo.com/bio/dnacopynum.php). The synthesized DNA template was serially
diluted to various concentrations and 1 µl of the diluted DNA sample was added to the
iNAAT reactions. The reactions were then incubated for 30 – 45 min at different
temperatures according to each method. Extracted genomic-RNA of SARS-CoV-2 was
quantified via a standard curve based on Ct-value and then serially diluted. Five µl of the
diluted RNA samples were added to the iNAAT reactions. The reactions were then
incubated for 45 min at the proper temperature.
RESULTS
Optimization of SARS-CoV-2 colorimetric iNAATs with the synthesized DNA
templates
The synthesized sequences of the Orf1ab and N gene of SARS-CoV-2 were utilized
as the template to perform the LAMP, CPA, and PSR reactions in the presence of the pHsensitive indicator phenol red. The results indicated that the color change from red to
yellow of the iNAAT reactions corresponding to the amplified products generated only
when the relevant DNA templates were present (Fig. 1).
Next, the optimal temperature and required time of iNAAT reactions for the
detection of SARS-CoV-2 were defined. For LAMP reactions, 15 min was the minimum
time required for the readout of positive amplification judged by eye (Fig. 2A, left panel).
Interestingly, Orf1ab-targeting primers performed the amplification process faster than
the N-targeting primers as the product could be observed just after 10 min of incubation

based on the gel electrophoresis result (data not shown). LAMP amplicons were
produced from 52 to 70

, however, the clearest color changes were observed at 60 °C

and higher temperature (Fig. 2A, right panel). Therefore, to guarantee the outcome signal,
the conditions of LAMP reaction were set at 60 °C for 30 min. Regarding CPA and PSR
reactions, amplified products could be observed the best after 30 min (Fig. 2B and C, left
panels). Meanwhile, 61 and 63 °C were the minimal temperatures for CPA and PSR
amplified products, respectively, to be visualized by the color change (Fig. 2B and C,
right panels). Thus, 30 min and 63 °C conditions were selected to perform CPA and PSR
reactions.
Specificity of SARS-CoV-2 colorimetric iNAATs
The sequences of primers used for iNAATs were aligned to genome sequences of
different strains of coronaviruses including 13 SARS-CoV-2 strains, MERS-CoV, SARSCoV, human coronavirus strains related to the common cold (HKU1, OC43, NL63, and
229E), bat SARS-like-CoV, Murine hepatitis virus (Murine coronavirus), and
Betacoronavirus England 1. The results showed that 0% mismatch with all tested SARSCoV-2

strains

and NC045512) was observed, suggesting that the developed iNAATs could detect
different strains of SARS-CoV-2 (Table 2). In contrast, except for bat SARS-like-CoV
2015 and 2017 strains, most of the other coronaviruses gave nucleotide mismatch higher
than 20% with our designed primers. Thus, it is likely that the designed primer sets would
not amplify those sequences, ensuring the specificity of iNAATs for SARS-CoV-2 (Table
2). in silico PCR results also support the high specificity of primer sets used (SI 1 file).
Further data demonstrated that the iNAATs primer sets used selectively detected the
presence of SARS-CoV-2 DNA while no cross-reactivity was observed with DNA of

SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV, and bat SARS-like-CoV (Fig. 3), confirming the absolute
specificity of the assay.
Limit of detection of Colorimetric iNAATs for synthesized SARS-CoV-2 DNAs
The LOD value of iNAAT reactions was evaluated using a serial-dilution of the
synthesized DNA templates in nuclease-free water. As shown in Fig. 4A and B, roughly a
single copy of the synthesized targeted gene per reaction was the lowest amount that
LAMP and CPA assays could detect. As for PSR, LOD of the primer set targeting the
Orf1ab sequence was 103 copies/reaction while N-primer set succeeded to detect a single
copy of the synthesized N-sequence (Fig. 4C). The obtained results indicated that primer
pairs designed for LAMP, CPA and PSR targeting N-sequence performed outstandingly
and highly promising for a real diagnosis. Thus, the PSR primer set targeting the Orf1ab
sequence was herein eliminated from further investigation.
Performance of SARS-CoV-2 colorimetric iNAATs with simulated clinical
specimens
The presence of non-target DNA in samples was shown to not interfere with the
sensitivity of LAMP [19, 21, 34]. Besides, the activity of an isothermal polymerase
utilized in LAMP, CPA and PSR is more tolerant to various PCR inhibitors such as trace
quantities of whole-blood, hemin, urine or stools [20, 35, 36]. Here, we used the
nasopharyngeal and oropharyngeal swab specimens as crude samples to test the
performance of iNAATs. Synthesized DNAs of SARS-CoV-2 were spiked into the crude
samples to mimic the clinical specimens. Considering that the crude samples contain a
variety of components that could interfere with the amplification reaction, dilution is
required for considerably better outcomes. Nasopharyngeal and oropharyngeal swabs
after collected are often preserved in a special solution called viral transport medium.

However, according to our previous studies, this medium strongly affected the reaction
color; up to 100 to 160-fold dilution factor was required to allow the color change to be
clearly observed (data not shown). It is no doubt that excessive dilution would
remarkably decrease the concentration of infectious virus and thus, reducing the chance
for the assay to detect the virus presence in clinical samples. With the aim of performing
the rapid test immediately at POC, the use of the viral transport medium could be
negligible. Therefore, we used nuclease-free water instead of the viral transport medium
to store the collected nasopharyngeal and oropharyngeal swabs.
As expected, 1 µl of undiluted crude samples still interfered with the color change
of the iNAAT reactions. Accordingly, from 5 to 10-fold dilution depending on the type of
samples and assay used was required to clearly establish the colorimetric reactions
between positive and negative signals (data not shown). Therefore, a 10-fold dilution of
nasopharyngeal and oropharyngeal samples was selected to examine the simulated
clinical specimens prepared. The results showed that all nasopharyngeal and
oropharyngeal swab samples without spiked DNA gave negative signals, indicating the
low rate of false-positive levels of our iNAATs (Fig. 5). DNA templates were spiked
into the nasopharyngeal and oropharyngeal swab samples to simulate the clinical
specimens containing SARS-CoV-2. The spiked samples were 10-fold diluted for
iNAATs. As expected, the developed iNAATs successfully detected all of the positive
simulated samples (Fig. 5), indicating the 100% sensitivity of the assays. The N-gene
targeting LAMP and Orf1ab-gene targeting CPR reactions required 45 min to establish
the clearest outcome, while Orf1ab-gene targeting LAMP and N-gene targeting PSR
reactions required 30 minutes to produce the best-visualized results (Fig. 5).

Performance of colorimetric iNAATs on extracted SARS-CoV-2 genomic RNA
SARS-CoV-2 was isolated from the clinical positive COVID-19 samples and
cultured at Pasteur Institute (Ho Chi Minh City, Vietnam). The viral genomic RNA was
extracted and quantitated using the standard curve based on qRT-PCR Ct-value [33]. The
LODs of the colorimetric iNAATs on this extracted SARS-CoV-2 genomic RNA was
evaluated. Results revealed that the LODs of LAMP were around 21.57 (Orf1ab) and
43.14 (N) viral-RNA copies/reaction (Table 3). The obtained values were outstanding
compared to 431.47 and 862.9 copies/reaction of CPA and PSR, respectively (Table 3).
Therefore, the LAMP assays were used for further evaluation with simulated clinical
samples containing the different amounts of spiked viral-RNAs. The results indicated that
the LAMP assays could directly detect SARS-CoV-2 genomic-RNA in crude samples
without the requirement of RNA extraction (Fig. 6).
Performance of SARS-CoV-2 colorimetric LAMP using lyophilized reagents
For better on-site testing, lyophilized reagents which are ready-to-use without strict
storage conditions at low temperature would be highly advantageous. Thus, we made an
attempt to verify the LAMP kit performance using the dried reagents. Accordingly, the
reaction mixture containing the enzyme, primers, and dye was first lyophilized. LODs of
the lyophilized LAMP kits for the simulated nasopharyngeal and oropharyngeal swab
samples containing the spiked synthetic DNA template were examined. Consistently, the
lyophilized kit targeting Orf1ab-sequence exhibited the faster amplification process than
the one targeting N-sequence. As for the Orf1ab-sequence set, results could be read after
30 min with the LOD value of 1 DNA copy/reaction, which is equivalent to 10 DNA
copies/µl in simulated specimens (Fig. 7A, upper panel). In contrast, the N-sequence set
expressed the slower reaction, which required 45 min for the color change to be clearly

observed. The N-sequence set also exhibited a LOD value of 1 DNA copy/reaction
corresponding to 10 DNA copies/µl in simulated samples (Fig. 7A, lower panel).
Subsequently, the LOD values of lyophilized LAMP kit for SARS-CoV-2 genomic
RNA were also evaluated. Both primer sets targeting Orf1ab- and N-sequence could
identify approximately 43.14 copies of viral RNA per reaction (Table 3). Note that the
LOD values defined correspond to a Ct value of roughly 36.5 when tested by qRT-PCR
for E gene [33]. This high Ct value (>35) strongly indicates that our lyophilized LAMP
kit could identify the specimens with low-level infection of SARS-CoV-2 found during
early infection or asymptomatic carriage.
Importantly, all mimicked samples containing different amount of synthesized DNA
or viral RNA were detected by our lyophilized LAMP kit, indicating the 100% sensitivity
of the dried-reagent LAMP assay (Fig. 7B and C). Accordingly, all nasopharyngeal and
oropharyngeal specimens without spiked DNA or viral RNA generated negative results,
ensuring the low false-positive occurrence of the assay (Fig. 7B and C). It is worth noting
that the direct addition of unprocessed clinical specimens to the reaction is greatly
convenient for diagnosis at POC, markedly reducing the time required for sample
preparation and thus, simplifying operation procedure. When all those features are taken
into account, the lyophilized LAMP kit is highly suitable for POC diagnosis.
DISCUSSION
The pneumonia outbreak COVID-19 has been announced by WHO as the global
pandemic. Even though each country has its own strategy to prevent the spread of the
disease, identifying the person who contracts the SARS-CoV-2 is one of the most
essential actions. While the gold standard for identifying the patients is real-time RTPCR (qRT-PCR), which shows remarkably high accuracy, sensitivity and specificity, it is
not portable and only specific high-biosafety laboratories are able to perform the test.

Also, the time required for each qRT-PCR test is at least 2 hours, if not including the time
needed for transferring the sample to the labs, thus slowing down the quarantine process
of the infected patient.
POC such as airports is the hot spots for spreading COVID-19 globally. However,
the prevention measures at the airports including body heat monitoring and checking
personal travel history, as well as passenger symptoms, have been proven to be
insufficient as some asymptomatic people are infectious [37-40]. Self-isolation and group
quarantine of suspected cases can temporarily limit the transmission, but it will be more
difficult to control when the number of suspects is high. The qRT-PCR tests only serve to
verify a small number of cases while the actions cannot be made immediately. Therefore,
POC diagnostic detection methods can help the authority to effectively monitor the
spreading of the virus.
The three isothermal amplification methods including LAMP, CPA and PSR all
require the DNA polymerase strand displacement activity. Among them, LAMP was first
introduced and has been widely utilized [41-43]. Meanwhile, CPA and PSR were later
developed and fewer studies evaluating these two methods have been published. In this
work, for the first time, the three methods were applied to directly detect SARS-CoV-2 to
compare their effectiveness. Surprisingly, despite showing similar performance regarding
the identification of the synthetic DNA template of SARS-CoV-2, LAMP was superior to
CPA and PSR in the detection of genomic RNA of SARS-CoV-2. Accordingly, the
colorimetric lyophilized LAMP kit developed in this study possesses the following
features: (i) fast detection of SARS-CoV-2 RNA directly from the nasopharyngeal and
oropharyngeal specimens within 45 minutes; (ii) high sensitivity (roughly 43 copies of
the viral RNA in the reaction is sufficient for detection); (iii) naked eye readout of
results; (iv) possible detection of the virus in the early stage of infection; (v) does not
require special laboratory equipment, only a popular thermal incubator is needed; (vi) is

amenable to high throughput testing; (vii) portable to use in any place and does not
require specialized personnel to do the test; and (viii) particularly useful for resourcelimited settings.
One of the most distinctive features of the SARS-CoV-2 colorimetric LAMP kit
developed herein is the direct use of unprocessed clinical samples. The only step required
to prepare samples before adding to the reaction is sample dilution in nuclease water.
Without the requirement for viral RNA extraction, the developed LAMP kit is very
suitable for on-site diagnosis, not only because it is much less time-consuming and
laborious but also does not depend on RNA extraction kits which have been at shortage
due to overwhelming global demand. We, therefore, propose the testing procedure as
illustrated in Figure 8. We anticipate that our LAMP test kit can contribute significantly
to a timely screening of COVID-19.

Figure 1. Colorimetric iNAATs to detect the presence of SARS-CoV-2 targeted
gene. (A) The color of iNAAT mixtures changed from red to yellow after incubation in
the presence of the synthesized DNA template (1 ng) of SARS-CoV-2. The lowest panel:
the reactions were added with SyBr Green I (Invitrogen, California, USA) and
illuminated by a 470 nm light source. The reactions were incubated at 60 °C (for LAMP)
and 63 °C (for CPA and PSR) for 30 min. (B) The amplified products in (A) were
analyzed with gel electrophoresis and compared with the routine PCR result.
Abbreviation, L: DNA ladder.
Figure 2. Optimization of the incubation time and temperature for iNAATs. The
LAMP (in A), CPA (in B) and PSR (in C) reactions were incubated from 10 to 60 min at
60 °C (LAMP) and 63 °C (CPA and PSR) (left panels) and at different temperatures from
50 to 70 °C for 30 min (right panels). One ng of the synthesized DNA template was used.
Figure 3. The specificity of the colorimetric iNAATs. The specificity of LAMP (in
A), CPA (in B) and PSR (in C) assay was evaluated with the synthesized DNA (1 ng) of
SARS-CoV-2, SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV, and bat SARS-like-CoV.
Figure 4. The LOD values of colorimetric iNAATs. LOD of LAMP (in A), CPA
(in B) and PSR (in C) assay were evaluated. The synthesized DNA template was serially
diluted in nuclease-free water to the indicated concentrations and 1 µl of the diluted DNA
templates was added to the reactions.

Figure 5. The accuracy of iNAATs for detecting SARS-CoV-2. Different
amounts of the synthetic-DNA template were spiked into the nasopharyngeal and
oropharyngeal swab samples to simulate the clinical samples containing SARS-CoV-2,
and 1 µl of the 10-fold diluted specimens was added to the LAMP (in A), CPA (in B) and
PSR (in C) reactions. The number indicates the copy of template per reaction.
Abbreviation, N: negative control; P: positive control.
Figure 6. Colorimetric LAMP assays for detection of SARS-CoV-2 genomic RNA
in simulated samples. Various concentrations of genomic RNA of SARS-CoV-2 were
spiked into the nasopharyngeal and oropharyngeal swab samples to simulate the clinical
specimens containing SARS-CoV-2. The mimicked samples were 50-fold diluted and 5
µl of the diluted specimens were added to the LAMP reactions. The number indicates the
copy of viral RNA per reaction. Abbreviation, N: negative control; P: positive control.
Figure 7. The performance of SARS-CoV-2 colorimetric lyophilized LAMP kit.
(A) LODs of lyophilized LAMP kit evaluated in the simulated samples. The defined
amount of synthetic DNA templates were spiked into the nasopharyngeal and
oropharyngeal swab samples, followed by the 10-fold dilution of simulated specimens
into water and 1 µl of the diluted samples was added to the reaction. The sensitivity of
lyophilized LAMP kit was examined with mimicked clinical specimens containing
different amounts of spiked synthetic DNA (in B) and SARS-CoV-2 genomic RNA (in
C). The number indicates the copy number of synthetic DNA or viral RNA in reaction.
Abbreviation, N: negative control; P: positive control.
