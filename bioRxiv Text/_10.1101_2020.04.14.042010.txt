Abstract

22

Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) has spread across

23

more than 200 countries and regions, leading to an unprecedented medical burden

24

and live lost. SARS-CoV-2 specific antivirals or prophylactic vaccines are not

25

available. Neutralizing antibodies provide efficient blockade for viral infection and are

26

a promising category of biological therapies. Using SARS-CoV-2 spike RBD as a bait,

27

we have discovered a panel of humanized single domain antibodies (sdAbs). These

28

sdAbs revealed binding kinetics with the equilibrium dissociation constant (KD) of

29

0.7∼33 nM. The monomeric sdAbs showed half maximal inhibitory concentration (IC50)

30

of 0.003∼0.3 µg/mL in pseudotyped particle neutralization assay, and 0.23∼0.50

31

µg/mL in authentic SARS-CoV-2 neutralization assay. Competitive ligand-binding data

32

suggested that the sdAbs either completely blocked or significantly inhibited the

33

association between SARS-CoV-2 RBD and viral entry receptor ACE2. Finally, we

34

showed that fusion of the human IgG1 Fc to sdAbs improved their neutralization

35

activity by tens of times. These results reveal the novel SARS-CoV-2 RBD targeting

36

sdAbs and pave a road for antibody drug development.

Introduction

45

Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is caused by infection of emerging severe

46

acute respiratory syndrome-associated coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) and had been

47

declared by World Health Organization as the first coronavirus pandemic in human

48

history1. The severity of COVID-19 symptoms can range from asymptomatic or mild to

49

severe with an estimated mortality rate from less than 2% to up to 10% of patients

50

depending on various factors2. SARS-CoV-2 is spreading rapidly and sustainably

51

around the world, urging prompt global actions to develop vaccines and antiviral

52

therapeutics.

53

SARS-CoV-2 polyprotein shares ~86.15% identity with SARS-CoV (Genbank ID:

54

AAS00002.1) and is classified into the genus betacoronavirus in the family

55

Coronaviridae3. SARS-CoV-2 is an enveloped, positive-sense, single-stranded RNA

56

virus with a large genome of approximately 30,000 nucleotides in length. The

57

virus-encoded membrane (M), spike (S) and envelope (E) proteins constitute the

58

majority of the protein that is incorporated into SARS-CoV-2 envelope lipid bilayer.

59

The S protein can form homotrimers and protrudes from envelope to show the coronal

60

appearance, invading susceptible cells by binding potential SARS-CoV-2 entry

61

receptor angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE2)3. Recently, researchers have

62

figured out the molecular structure of SARS-CoV-2 S protein4. It is composed of 1273

63

amino acids and structurally belongs to the type I membrane fusion protein with two

64

areas S1 and S2. The S1 region mainly includes the receptor binding domain (RBD),

65

while the S2 region is necessary for membrane fusion. The RBD structure determines

66

its binding efficiency with ACE2 and provides an important target for neutralizing

67

antibody recognition.

68

Single domain antibodies (sdAbs), namely nanobodies, were initially identified from

69

camelids or cartilaginous fish heavy-chain only antibodies devoid of light chains,

70

where antigen-binding is mediated exclusively by a single variable domain (VHH)5.

71

Therefore, sdAbs are the smallest fragments that retain the full antigen-binding

72

capacity of the antibody with advantageous properties as drugs, imaging probes and

73

diagnostic reagents6. The advantages of short development time, flexible formatting

74

and robust production efficiency make sdAb a powerful means to defeat infectious

75

disease pandemics. For therapeutic purpose, relatively sophisticated humanization

76

techniques have been adopted to modify the camelid-specific amino acid sequences

77

in the framework to their human heavy chain variable domain equivalent, without

78

altering sdAb’s biological and physical properties and reducing species heterogeneity7.

79

As SARS-CoV-2 is an emerging human virus, the whole population is susceptible due

80

to the lack of protective antibodies. The existing neutralizing antibodies in

81

convalescent plasma have been adopted as powerful therapeutic alternatives for

82

COVID-19 patients in China. Using a synthetic humanized sdAbs discovery platform,

83

we were able to obtain several high-affinity SARS-CoV-2 RBD targeting sdAbs with

84

desired neutralization activities.

85
86

Results

87

SARS-CoV-2 makes use its envelope S glycoprotein to gain entry into host cells

88

through binding ACE2. Recent cryo-EM research revealed that the S protein shows

89

an asymmetrical homotrimer with a single RBD in the “up” confirmation and the other

90

two “down”4. Antibodies may take advantage of this RBD structure to block virus entry.

91

To enrich for SARS-CoV-2 RBD binding sdAbs, we performed four rounds of

92

biopanning using a lab owned, full synthetic, humanized phage display library with

93

recombinant RBD protein. After phage ELISA identification of 480 clones, a number of

94

sdAbs exhibited an excellent affinity for SARS-CoV-2 RBD. Five distinctive sdAd

95

sequences (1E2, 2F2, 3F11, 4D8 and 5F8) were cloned into a prokaryotic expression

96

vector and recombinant sdAb proteins were purified by nickel-charged sepharose

97

affinity chromatography (Fig. 1a). Humanized sdAbs obtained in this study are about

98

125 amino acids with a single VHH domain in average molecular weight less than

99

15KDa (Fig. 1a). The sdAbs consist of three complementarity determining regions

100

(CDRs) as well as four framework regions (FRs). The amino acids in the frameworks

101

have been maximally humanized, except for residues Phe-42 and Gly-52 in

102

framework-2 to maintain proper antigen affinity and best stability7.

103

Surface plasmon resonance (SPR) technology is widely accepted as a golden

104

standard for characterizing antibody-antigen interactions. To determine the kinetic

105

rate and affinity constants, detailed analysis of S antigen-binding to purified sdAb

106

proteins was carried out by SPR. The SARS-CoV-2 or SARC-CoV S protein was

107

immobilized on the surface of Biacore Chip CM5, respectively. Then, various

108

concentrations of purified sdAbs were prepared and injected to pass over the surface.

109

The sensorgram data were fitted to a 1:1 steady-state binding model. SPR results

110

demonstrated that the equilibrium dissociation constant (KD) for the SARS-CoV-2 S

111

protein against sdAbs 1E2, 2F2, 3F11, 4D8 and 5F8 were 21.1 nM, 0.846 nM, 3.154

112

nM, 33.97 nM and 0.676 nM respectively (Fig. 1b-1f & 1h). However, the sdAbs

113

showed no binding with SARS-CoV S protein, except for the clone 5F8 demonstrating

114

a relatively low affinity with KD = 239.2 nM (Fig. 1g & 1h). Overall, as monovalent

115

antibody fragment, the sdAbs identified in this study reveals a satisfactory binding

116

performance in a SARS-CoV-2 specific manner.

117

To further evaluate the neutralization activity of these sdAbs, SARS-CoV-2

118

S-pseudotyped particle (SARS-CoV-2pp) infectivity assay was first established.

119

Pseudotyped particles are chimeric virions that consist of a surrogate viral core with a

120

heterologous viral envelope protein at their surface, which can be operated in

121

Biosafety Level 2 (BSL-2) and frequently used tool for studying virus entry mechanism

122

and neutralizing antibodies8. We observed that all five sdAbs showed inhibition

123

potency of SARS-CoV-2pp infection with IC50 (half maximal inhibitory concentration)

124

ranging from 0.003 to 0.3 µg/mL (Fig. 2a). We next tested the neutralization activity of

125

the sdAbs with live SARS-CoV-2 virus (Fig. 2b). Similarly, these sdAbs showed

126

comparable neutralization efficiency, with IC50 at approximately 0.2-0.6 µg/mL. Totally,

127

these monovalent sdAbs demonstrated encouraging neutralization activity against

128

both pseudotyped and authentic virus, although the neutralization potency is not

129

completely matched (Fig. 2c). This phenomenon was normally reported in Middle

130

East Respiratory Syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) neutralizing antibodies and

131

may be likely explained by the difference in sdAb recognized RBD spatial epitope or

132

the steric hindrance formed by antigen-antibody complex9,10.

133

Within SARS-CoV-2 RBD, the receptor binding motif (RBM) directly contacts ACE2.

134

Recent report demonstrating that SARS-CoV-2 uses ACE2 as its receptor with a

135

much stronger affinity (10- to 20-fold higher) than SARS-CoV4. To determine whether

136

sdAbs targeted different antigenic regions on the SARS-CoV-2 RBD surface, we

137

performed a competition-binding assay using a real-time biosensor (Fig. 3). We tested

138

all five sdAbs in a competition-binding assay in which human ACE2 was attached to a

139

CM5 biosensor. Compared with a non-related isotype control sdAb (Fig. 3a), addition

140

of 1E2, 3F11 and 4D8 completely prevent binding of SARS-CoV-2 RBD to ACE2 (Fig.

141

3b, 3d, 3e). Whereas, sdAbs 2F2 and 5F8 could partially compete the RBD/receptor

142

association (Fig. 3c & 3f). These data suggested that these sdAbs can be divided into

143

RBM targeting or non-RBM targeting groups though it is not directly associated with

144

virus neutralization activity.

145

SdAbs can be readily fused to human Fc-domain to overcome the limitations of the

146

monovalent sdAbs, such as the short blood residential time and lacking

147

antibody-dependent

148

cytotoxicity11. In addition, bivalent sdAbs can be obtained via the disulfide bond

149

formation in Fc hinge area, which was reported to significantly increase sdAb’s

150

activity12. To further explore the possibility of sdAb-based antiviral therapeutics and

151

enhance neutralization activity, we constructed human heavy chain antibodies by

152

fusing the human IgG1 Fc region to the C-terminus of sdAbs (Fig. 4a & 4b). These Fc

153

fusion sdAbs were produced in mammalian cells with suspension yields around 25-50

154

µg per milliliter in shaking flask. The supernatant samples were analyzed in both

155

reducing and non-reducing conditions in Western blot using an anti-human IgG to

156

detect Fc. As shown in Fig. 4c, the size of the constructed intact sdAb-Fc is around 80

157

KDa in the non-reducing condition, but a 40 KDa monomer was observed by prior

158

treatment in reducing condition to break disulfide bonds. This suggests a correct

159

expression and secretion of heavy chain antibodies in consistence with our design.

160

Neutralization assay results showed that genetic fusion of human Fc significantly

161

increased the neutralization activity of these sdAbs for 10- to 80-fold in molar

162

concentration of IC50 using the SARS-CoV-2pp entry assay (Fig. 4d). Importantly,

163

several Fc-fused sdAbs demonstrated potency with IC80 at sub-nanomolar level (Fig.

164

4d). Finally, we showed that some of the sdAbs are suitable for immunofluorescence

165

staining (Supplementary Fig. 1) and Western blot to detect ectopically expressed

166

SARS-CoV-2 S protein (Supplementary Fig. 2).

167
168

Discussion

169

Given the disease severity and rapid global spread of COVID-19, there is an urgent

170

need for development of vaccines, monoclonal antibodies, and small-molecule

171

direct-acting antiviral medications. Neutralizing antibodies directly target viral

172

envelope protein, precisely block the virus-receptor association, and inhibit virus entry

173

through a variety of molecular mechanisms. In this study, we isolated and

174

characterized several humanized neutralizing sdAbs that exhibit one- to two-digit

175

nanomolar or even sub-nanomolar IC50 against SARS-CoV-2 using both pseudotyped

176

and infectious viruses. SdAbs have been investigated as important therapeutic

177

alternatives against viral infection because of their high yield, low cost and intrinsic

178

stability. For MERS-CoV, neutralizing sdAbs were isolated from immunized

179

dromedary camels or llamas and demonstrated IC50 value between 0.001-0.003

180

µg/mL with low KD values (0.1-1 nM)13,14. Comparable inhibition efficiency on

181

SARS-CoV-2pp and affinity kinetics were obtained for the sdAbs 2F2, 3F11 and 5F8

182

identified in this study using a non-immune library, which can speed up the discovery

183

of neutralizing antibodies in an emergent outbreak. With further optimization and

184

increase of library size and diversity, the synthetic sdAb library technology will

185

promote the discovery speed of powerful therapeutic antibodies15,16.

186

FDA approved the first sdAb-based medicine for adults with acquired thrombotic

187

thrombocytopenic purpura in 201917-20. Considering the cost and potential risks of full

188

human antibody in some viral diseases, such as dengue virus infection, sdAb

189

fragments are a novel category of therapeutic molecules and can be readily

190

reconstructed in a tandemly linked way to increase their blood residential time,

191

biological activity, and eliminate underlying concerns about antibody-dependent

192

enhancement (ADE) of viral infection21. In addition to being used as an injectable drug,

193

the stable sdAbs can be also developed into aerosolized inhalations and disinfection

194

products for the prevention of COVID-19. Besides, prior to the success of COVID-19

195

vaccines, the construction of sdAb-based adenovirus or adeno-associated virus gene

196

therapy might provide long-term passive immune protection in vulnerable population,

197

health care workers, or in severely affected areas. Since the mature COVID-19 animal

198

models have not been developed, this study did not involve in vivo studies. As a next

199

step, the crystal structure analysis of antigen-antibody complexes will be put on the

200

agenda. In conclusion, the discovered neutralizing antibodies in this study could lead

201

to new specific antiviral treatments and shed light on the design and optimization of

202

COVID-19 vaccines.

Calu-3 (human lung adenocarcinoma) cells were obtained from China Infrastructure

211

of Cell Line Resource (Beijing, China) and maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's

212

medium (DMEM, ThermoFisher, Waltham, MA, USA) supplemented with 2-10% fetal

213

bovine serum (FBS, ThermoFisher), non-essential amino acid, penicillin and

214

streptomycin. Recombinant proteins were purchased from Sino Biological (Beijing,

215

China) for SARS-CoV-2 RBD (40592-V05H, 40592-V08B), SARS-CoV-2 spike

216

(40589-V08B1), SARS-CoV spike (40150-V08B1), ACE2 (10108-H08H). Antibodies

Library design and construction.

220

A synthetic sdAb phage display library was used for the screening of SARS-CoV-2

221

neutralizing antibodies. To minimize a possible antigenic effect from camelid

222

sequences, sdAb frameworks for library construction were determined according to a

223

universal humanized scaffold architecture7. Briefly, residues in frames 1, 3 and 4 were

224

mutated based on human heavy chain VH in maximum. In frame 2, humanization of

225

residues at positions 49 and 50 was adopted to increase stability of sdAbs, whereas

226

residues 42 and 52 are maintained in camelid due to their critical impact on antigen

227

affinity and/or stability. For the design of variable regions, we analyzed a robust CDR

228

repertoire from immune or naïve llama VHH clones. A synthetic diversity was

229

introduced in the three CDRs by random nucleotide incorporation with cysteine and

230

stop codon avoided. A constant length of 8 amino acids was selected for CDR1 and

231

CDR2, and 18 amino acids for CDR3. Frameworks and CDRs were assembled by

232

overlapping polymerase chain reaction (PCR) ensuring each unique CDR recombined

233

in the assembled molecules. Diversified sdAb mixture was cloned in phagemid vector

fADL-1 (Antibody Design Labs, San Diego, CA, USA) using SfiI/BglI sites with the

235

PelB peptide leader sequence fused with the sdAbs at N-terminus. Massive

236

electroporation was carried out using E. coli TG1 cells. More than a thousand agar

237

petri dishes (140 mm) were plated to ensure enough size of the library. Quality control

238

was carried out by sequencing more than 1000 clones, and the error rate and diversity

239

were calculated.

240

Antibody selection by phage display.

241

Screening for SARS-CoV-2 RBD targeting antibodies was performed by panning in

242

both immunotubes and native condition using a proprietary full-synthetic library of

243

humanized sdAbs with high-diversity, according to a standard protocol. Briefly, for the

244

2nd and 4th panning rounds, the purified SARS-CoV-2 RBD protein was coated on

245

Nunc MaxiSorp immuno tubes (ThermoFisher) at around 5µg/mL in PBS overnight.

246

For the 1st and 3rd panning rounds, RBD protein was first biotinylated with EZ-Link™

247

Sulfo-NHS-LC-Biotin (ThermoFisher) and then selected with streptavidin-coated

248

magnetic Dynabeads™ M-280 (ThermoFisher). The tubes or beads were blocked

249

using 2% w/v skimmed milk powder in PBS (MPBS). After rinsing with PBS, about

250

1×1013 phage particles were added to the antigen-coated immuno tube or biotinylated

251

antigen in the presence of 2% MPBS, incubated for 2 h shaking (30 rpm) at RT.

252

Unbound phages were washed with PBS Tween 0.1% (10 times) and PBS (10 times),

253

while bound phage were eluted with 0.1M Glycine-HCl (pH=3.0). Eluted phages were

254

neutralized by adding 1M Tris-Cl pH 9.0 and used for infection of exponentially

255

growing E. coli TG1. After 4 rounds of panning, phage ELISA identification was

256

performed with 480 individual colonies using Anti-CM13 antibody [B62-FE2] (HRP).

257

The absorbance was measured using a SpectraMax M5 plate reader from Molecular

258

Divices (San Jose, CA, USA). The positive clones were sent for sequencing, and

259

representative sdAb sequences were chosen for protein expression.

262

NcoI/XhoI sites of the pET28b (Novagen, Sacramento, CA, USA) and transformed

263

into BL21(DE3) chemically competent E. coli. A single colony was picked to inoculate

264

10 ml of LB media containing Kanamycin (100 µg/mL) and incubated at 37°C on an

265

orbital shaker overnight. This preculture was diluted 1:100 in 400 mL of LB media

266

containing Kanamycin (100 µg/mL) and grown at 37°C until the OD600 nm reached 0.4.

267

The expression of recombinant sdAbs was induced by adding IPTG to a final

268

concentration of 0.3 mM after culture has reached OD600=0.5-0.6 and grown over

269

night at 20°C. The sdAbs with a His-tag fused at C-terminus were purified over Ni

270

Sepharose 6 Fast Flow (GE Healthcare, Boston, MA, USA) and eluted with 400 mM

271

imidazole. Affinity purified sdAbs were dialyzed against PBS to eliminate imidazole.

Affinity measurement and competition-binding Study.

273

The surface plasmon resonance experiments were performed at room temperature

274

using a BiaCore T200 with CM5 sensor chips (GE Healthcare). The surfaces of the

275

sample and reference flow cells were activated with a 1:1 mixture of 0.1 M NHS

276

(N-hydroxysuccinimide)

277

propyl-N-ethylcarbodiimide) at a flow rate of 10 μL/min. The reference flow cell was

278

left blank. All the surfaces were blocked with 1 M ethanolamine, pH 8.0. The running

279

buffer was HBS-EP (0.01M HEPES, pH 7.4, 150 mM NaCl, 3 mM EDTA, 0.05%

280

surfactant P20).

281

For binding affinity assays, the SARS-CoV-2 or SARS-CoV S protein was diluted in

282

10mM sodium acetate buffer, pH5.5, and was immobilized on the chip at about 300

283

response units. Antibodies 1E2, 2F2, 3F11, 4D8 and 5F8 at gradient concentrations (0,

284

1.56nM, 3.125nM, 6.25nM, 12.5nM, 25nM) were flowed over the chip surface. After

285

each cycle, the sensor surface was regenerated with10mM glycine-HCl pH 2.5. The

286

data were fitted to a 1:1 interaction steady-state binding model using the

287

BIAevaluation 1.0 software.

288

For competition-binding assays, the ACE2 protein was diluted in 10mM sodium

289

100nM antibody (1E2, 2F2, 3F11, 4D8 or 5F8). The RBD in different buffer at gradient

292

concentrations (0, 6.25 25, 100, 400nM) was flowed over the chip surface. After each

293

cycle, the sensor surface was regenerated with 10mM glycine-HCl pH 2.5. The

294

binding kinetics was analyzed with the software of BIAevaluation using a 1:1 binding

295

model.

296

Production of SARS-CoV-2 spike pseudotyped particle (SARS-CoV-2pp) and

297

virus entry assay.

298

To produce SARS-CoV-2pp, HEK293T cells were seeded 1 day prior to transfection at

299

2.5×106 cells in a 10-cm plate. The next day, cells were transfected using

300

Lipofectamine 2000 (ThermoFisher). The plasmid DNA transfection mixture (1 ml)

301

was composed of 15 µg of pNL-4.3-Luc-E-R- and 15 µg of pcDNA-SARS-CoV-2-S that

302

was purchased from Sino Biologicals and reconstructed by deletion of 18 amino acid

303

cytoplasmic tail. A nonenveloped lentivirus particle (Bald virus) was also generated as

304

negative control. Sixteen hours after transfection, the media was replaced with fresh

305

media supplemented with 2% FBS. Supernatants containing SARS-CoV-2pp were

306

typically harvested 36–48 h after transfection and then filtered through a syringe filter.

307

The typical relative luminometer units for SARS-CoV-2pp were between 106 and 107.

308

To conduct the virus entry assay, Vero E6 or other cells were seeded in a 96-well plate

309

at 1 day prior to transduction. The next day, 100 µL of supernatant containing

310

SARS-CoV-2pp was added into each well in the absence or presence of serially

311

diluted sdAbs or human IgG1 Fc-fused sdAbs. Forty-eight hours after transduction,

312

cells were lysed in 100 µL of passive lysis buffer and 50 µL lysate was incubated with

313

100 µL of luciferase assay substrate according to the manufacturer’s instructions

314

(Promega, Madison, WI, USA).

315

SARS-CoV-2 neutralization assay.

316

SARS-CoV-2 was isolated from bronchoalveolar lavage specimens from a COVID-19

317

patient as described previously23. The viral titers were determined by using tissue

318

culture infective dose (TCID50). For antibody neutralization assay, Vero cells were

319

seeded in 96-well plates at 1 day prior to infection. Serially diluted sdAbs were mixed

320

with SARS-CoV-2 at a multiplicity of infection (MOI) of 0.05 and incubated at 37℃ for

321

1h. The antibody-virus mixture was incubated on Vero cells at 37℃ for 1h. Unbound

322

SARS-CoV-2 virions were removed by washing cells with fresh medium, then

323

incubated for 24 h at 37 °C. The culture supernatants were collected for viral nucleic

324

acid quantification. Viral nucleocapsid gene RNA quantification was carried out by

325

TaqMan real-time RT-PCR as reported with plotted standard curves using in vitro

326

transcribed RNA.

327

Production of human IgG1 Fc fusion sdAbs.

328

The sequences of selected sdAbs were cloned into a mammalian expression vector

329

under the control of hEF1-HTLV promotor and fused with N-terminal interleukin-2

330

signal peptide and C-terminal Fc region, comprising the CH2 and CH3 domains of

331

human IgG1 heavy chain and the hinge region. Maxipreped plasmids were transiently

332

transfected into 293-F cells (Thermofisher) and the cells were further cultured in

333

suspension for 6 days before harvesting antibody-containing supernatant. Fc-fused

334

sdAbs were prepared with prepacked HiTrap® Protein A HP column (GE Healthcare).

335

The produced Fc-fusion protein was analyzed by SDS-PAGE and the Western blot

336

using standard protocols for dimerization, yield and purity measurement. The primary

337

antibody used for Western blot was a horseradish peroxidase conjugated goat

338

anti-mouse IgG (Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO, USA).

339

Immunofluorescence microscopy and Western blot.

340

Cultured 293T cells on coverslips were transfected with either SARS-CoV-2 S

341

expression plasmid or empty vector for 24 h and then fixed using 4%

342

paraformaldehyde for 15 min at room temperature, permeabilized with 0.1% Triton

343

X-100 (Sigma-Aldrich) in PBS for 10 min. The cells were then incubated with each

344

sdAb overnight at 4°C. After three washes with PBS, the cells were incubated with

345

Alexa Fluor 488–conjugated 6x-His Tag monoclonal antibody (ThermoFisher) for 1

346

hour at room temperature. The nuclei were stained with DAPI (1:10,000) diluted in

347

PBS for 5 min and mounted with an antifade reagent (ThermoFisher). Images were

348

acquired with a Leica TCS SP5 confocal microscope system.

349

For Western blot, 293T cells in 6-well plate were transfected with SARS-CoV-2 S,

350

SARS-CoV-2 S or empty vector individually. Twenty-four h post transfection, cell

351

lysates were prepared, and the samples were boiled with 2× SDS loading buffer and

352

loaded onto a 10% polyacrylamide gel. After electrophoresis, the separated proteins

353

were transferred onto a nitrocellulose membrane (Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA, USA). The

354

resulting blots were probed with a sdAb as primary antibody and an HRP-linked

355

6x-His Tag antibody (Thermofisher, HIS.H8) as the secondary antibody. The ECL

356

reagent (Amersham Biosciences, Piscataway, NJ, USA) was used as the substrate for

357

detection.

358

Statistical analysis.

359

Data were analyzed using GraphPad Prism 6.01 (GraphPad Software, San Diego, CA,

360

USA). The values shown in the graphs are presented as means ± SD. IC50 was

361

calculated based on curve fitness with nonlinear regression and showed by one

362

representative result from at least two independent experiments.
