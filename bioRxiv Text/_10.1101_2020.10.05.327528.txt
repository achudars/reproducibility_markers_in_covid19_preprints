ABSTRACT

21

Heat treatment denatures viral proteins that comprise the virion, making virus incapable of

22

infecting a host. Coronavirus (CoV) virions contain single-stranded RNA genomes with a lipid

23

envelope and 4 proteins, 3 of which are associated with the lipid envelope and thus are thought to

24

be easily denatured by heat or surfactant-type chemicals. Prior studies have shown that a

25

temperature of as low as 75 ℃ and treatment duration of 15 min can effectively inactivate CoV.

26

The applicability of a CoV heat inactivation method greatly depends on the length of time of a

27

heat treatment and the temperature needed to inactivate the virus. With the goal of finding

28

conditions where sub-second heat exposure of CoV can sufficiently inactivate CoV, we designed

29

and developed a simple system that can measure sub-second heat inactivation of CoV. The

30

system is composed of capillary stainless-steel tubing immersed in a temperature-controlled oil

31

bath followed by an ice bath, through which virus solution can be flowed at various speeds.

32

Flowing virus solution at different speeds, along with a real-time temperature monitoring system,

33

allows the virus to be accurately exposed to a desired temperature for various durations of time.

34

Using mouse hepatitis virus (MHV), a beta-coronavirus, as a model system, we identified that

35

85.2 ℃ for 0.48 s exposure is sufficient to obtain > 5 Log10 reduction in viral titer (starting titer:

36

5 × 107 PFU/mL), and that when exposed to 83.4 ℃ for 0.95 s, the virus was completely

37

inactivated (zero titer, > 6 Log10 reduction).

38

IMPORTANCE

39

Three coronaviruses (CoVs) have now caused global outbreaks within the past 20 years, with the

40

COVID19 pandemic caused by SARS-CoV-2 still ongoing. Methods that can rapidly inactivate

41

viruses, especially CoVs, can play critical roles in ensuring public safety and safeguarding

42

personal health. Heat treatment of viruses to inactive them can be an efficient and inexpensive

method, with the potential to be incorporated into various human-occupied spaces. In this work,

a simple system that can heat-treat viruses for extremely short period was developed and utilized

to show that sub-second exposure of CoV to heat is sufficient to inactivate CoV. This opens up

the possibility of developing instruments and methods of disinfecting CoV in diverse settings,

also be broadly utilized to assess heat sensitivity of viruses other viral pathogens of interest and

1 Introduction

55

Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is the virus responsible for the

56

currently ongoing global pandemic, the coronavirus disease of 2019 (COVID-19) (1-3). The

57

main transmission routes of SARS-CoV-2 include direct or indirect contact with objects or

58

contaminated surfaces, short-range person-to-person transmission via droplets from coughing or

59

sneezing, and long-range airborne transmission via aerosols (4). Therefore, environmental

60

sterilization and virus inactivation are of great importance to prevent and control the spread of

61

the virus. Currently, the most commonly used methods to sterilize or inactivate viruses include

62

treatment using chemical agents, UV irradiation exposure, and heat treatment, which have all

63

been intensively assessed and reported (5-10). Compared with other methods, one major

64

advantage of heat treatment is its relatively shorter treatment time and simplistic method, along

65

with the ability to be incorporated into various human-occupied space (11-13), which allows for

66

the technique to be readily implemented into a variety of existing applications or systems that

67

could be readily retrofitted to add rapid pathogen inactivation functionality, such as existing

68

heating, ventilation, and air conditioning (HVAC) systems as well as sewer systems.

69

Heat inactivation is a relatively easy, safe, and efficient method to disinfect coronavirus (CoV),

70

as CoV is an enveloped virus that is surrounded by a lipid bilayer with viral spike proteins

71

projecting from the lipid envelope, where both the envelope and the spike protein are susceptible

72

to heat (14). Previous studies have shown that at a temperature of 56 ℃ and higher, with heat

73

application time typically longer than 1 min, is needed to efficiently inactivate CoVs such as

74

SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV (> 6 Log10 reduction) (5, 6, 13). More specifically, at relatively low

75

treatment temperatures (56 - 65 ℃), treatment time of 15 - 60 min was required, while at higher

76

treatment temperatures (70 - 100 ℃) a much shorter duration of 1 to 15 min was needed (5, 6, 13,

1

77

15-17). For example, heat treatment of SARS-CoV-2 at 70 ℃ for 5 min achieved > 4.5 Log10

78

reduction (15), with another study reported that heat treatment at 92 ℃ for 15 min achieved > 6

79

Log10 reduction for SARS-CoV-2 (5). However, for heat treatment to be effectively utilized for

80

liquid and airborne CoV inactivation in broad ranges of practical settings, such methods need to

81

be effective at a significantly shorter heat treatment time (even if the temperature itself has to be

82

higher), otherwise there is limited practicality in such heat treatment methods. For example,

83

having to increase the temperature of liquid for minutes would consume large amount of energy,

84

and having to treat air for minutes becomes impractical.

85

Here, we hypothesize that a much shorter heat treatment time may be sufficient to destroy key

86

components of CoVs (e.g., envelope or the spike proteins) to completely inactivate CoV.

87

Conventional heat treatment testing method mostly utilizes a simple method of dipping a CoV-

88

containing tube into a temperature-controlled water bath. Such methods are valid when heat

89

treatment time in the range of minutes are utilized, but cannot be used if seconds or sub-second

90

temperature exposure needs to be tested. In this study, we developed a simple flow-through

91

heating and cooling method utilizing a stainless steel capillary tube, and used the method to

92

investigate the effect of CoV heat treatment at an extremely short heat exposure time of 0.1 - 1 s

93

at an actually applied temperature range of 35-100 ℃. This study provides essential data for the

94

development of sub-second CoV heat inactivation approaches, including methods to efficiently

95

inactivate airborne CoVs indoors. As all CoVs are surrounded by lipid bilayer membranes with

96

similar proteins and have similar physical properties (14), we expect that our finding using

97

mouse hepatitis virus (MHV), a beta-coronavirus, as a model system, can be broadly applicable

98

to CoVs in general, including SARS-CoV, SARS-CoV-2, and MERS-CoV, to name a few. Since

99

many other viruses, such as dengue virus, influenza virus, and measles virus, are also enveloped

viruses where the envelopes contain surface proteins (18), we expect that this heat inactivation

101

method can have broad utility for many other viruses of global consequences.

2 Material and Methods

104

2.1 Virus and cells preparation

105

The coronavirus used in this study is mouse hepatitis virus, strain A59 (MHV-A59), and has

106

been described previously (19, 20). Mouse L2 cells, which are susceptible to MHV infection,

107

were grown in Dulbecco Modified Eagle’s Medium (DMEM) supplemented with 4 mM

108

glutamine and 10% defined calf serum (Hyclone), at 37 ℃ 5% CO2 environment (21).

109
110

2.2 Virus titration and plaque assay

111

Plaque assays were conducted as described previously and read at 2 days post-infection after

112

removing the agarose overlay and staining with crystal violet (22). Samples were assayed in

113

triplicate and the plaques were counted, and infectivity was determined and expressed as plaque

114

forming units (PFU)/ml.

115
116

2.3 Heat treatment of virus solution

117

Fig. 1 shows the experimental setup that allowed rapid and high-temperature heat treatment of

118

viruses. Stainless-steel (SS) capillary tubing (SS 304, 1/16” outer diameter, 0.02” (500 µm) wall

119

thickness, 0.0225” (572 µm) inner diameter, Mcmaster-Carr, Douglasville, USA) was bent and

120

immersed in an oil bath and then in an ice bath sequentially. A relatively small inner diameter

121

tubing was selected to minimize the volume of solution so that the virus solution can be rapidly

3

122

heated and cooled down, and SS was utilized to maximize heat conduction from the exterior to

123

the interior of the tubing. Since a short pulse of high-temperature application was desired to

124

accurately assess the impact of the temperature on viral infectivity, an ice bath was utilized to

125

rapidly cool down the heated viral solution. A temperature-controlled oil bath (Instatherm®

126

Economy Bath/Controller Kit, Ace Glass, Inc., VWR, USA) equipped with a type J

127

thermocouple temperature sensor was employed to control the heat treatment temperature.

128

Vegetable cooking oil (Member’s mark, Sam’s Club, College Station, USA) was used in the oil

129

bath. A mixture of ice and water was used as the ice bath to cool down the treated virus solution

130

immediately after treatment. A syringe pump (Fusion 200, Chemyx, Stafford, USA) was

131

employed to control the flow rate of the injected virus solution. Silicon tubing was used to

132

connect to the syringe to the inlet of the SS tubing and also to collect the heat-treated samples

133

from the outlet of the SS tubing. Low-thermal-conducting silicon tubing was utilized to further

134

limit the temperature exposure to only a short section of the overall tubing. The collected virus

135

samples were stored at -80℃ until plaque assays were conducted to measure the infectivity of

136

the heat-treated viruses.

137

Stock MHV viruses of 2.7 × 109 PFU/mL were diluted by DMEM media with 10% FBS to 5 ×

138

107 PFU/mL, a high-enough titer to accurately determine the effectiveness of heat treatment on

139

viral infectivity, prior to heat inactivation treatments. For each heat treatment, a virus solution

140

aliquot of 1.5 mL containing approximately 75 million viral PFUs was injected into the SS

141

capillary tubing under varying flow rates by a syringe pump while the oil bath temperature was

142

set as 55 ℃ - 170 ℃. The treated samples were collected at the outlet of the silicon tubing. The

143

set exposure time is calculated based on the traveling distance of the viral solution through the

144

length of the SS tubing immersed in the oil bath (5 cm). The flow rate and set exposure time are

145

summarized in Table S1. A viral solution flowing through the tubing while the oil bath

146

temperature was set to room temperature (22 ℃) was used as a control to account for any

147

potential viral titer reduction due to virus adhering to the tubing surfaces and other potential

148

losses.

2.4 COMSOL simulation of temperature

153

The COMSOL Multiphysics 5.5a software (COMSOL Inc., Palo Alto, CA, USA) was used for

154

the temperature profile simulation of the viral solution. To perform this finite element analysis, a

155

3D geometry was chosen, where the geometry was created using the following initial and

156

boundary conditions: initial temperature of the entire system is set to 20 °C; no-slip conditions

157

on the tubing surfaces; no viscous stress and convective flux on the tubing outlet; the fluid is

158

Newtonian and the flow within the channel is incompressible; convective heat flux is considered

159

as the source of heat influx from the oil to the tubing.

160

The simulation was performed using non-isothermal flow (nitf) multi-physical interfaces

161

(laminar flow (spf) coupling with heat transfer in solids and fluids (ht) under the stationary study

162

model. The inlet flow temperature and ambient air temperature were set to 22 ℃. The material

163

physical properties of viral solution were set to be identical to those of water. The material

164

properties of the SS tubing were set to: density = 7850 kg/m3; thermal conductivity = 16.2

165

W/(m⋅K); heat capacity at constant pressure = 500 J/(kg⋅K). Here, we assume the overall heat

166

loss by the oil bath is equal to the overall heat gain of water flowing by (the heat loss to ambient

167

air is neglectable). Then, the temperature-dependent heat transfer coefficient (H) was calculated

168

based on equation (1) (23, 24) and the real-time temperature measurement (see section 2.5 for

169

more details). The calculated H value of 473.6 W/(m2⋅K) for 125°C, 0.5 s and 675.5 W/(m2⋅K)

170

for 170 °C, 0.1 s are close to previously published results (25). Physics-controlled mesh with the

171

element size of “finer” was applied for the simulation.

2.5 Real-time temperature measurement and validation of the measurement method

177

To test the real-time temperature of the viral solution flowing through the tubing while the heat is

178

applied through the heated oil bath, the SS tubing was cut apart between the oil bath and the ice

179

bath, and the two ends were re-connected through a T-connector with insulation material

180

(Fiberglass) wrapped around the connector (Mcmaster-carr, Douglasville, USA). A J-type

181

thermocouple was inserted through the top end of the T-connector to obtain real-time

182

temperature of the viral solution flowing through the tubing. The temperature of the tubing wall

183

was measured by attaching the sensor head of the thermocouple to the outside wall the SS tubing

184

and wrapped with fiberglass.

185

The temperature measured by this experimental setup (T-thermocouple) was validated and

186

calibrated by withdrawing water heated to a known temperature via a syringe pump (EGATO®

187

111, KD scientific, MA, USA) while the temperature reading of the sensor was recorded. The

188

schematic illustration of this measurement setup is described in Fig. S1-A.

3 Results and Discussion

191

3.1 Validation of the viral solution treatment temperature

192

As our study aims to inactivate CoVs with a sub-second exposure to high temperature, accurately

193

measuring the real temperature applied to the viral solution is imperative. Since the solution

194

cannot be heated up or cooled down instantaneously and the desired temperature exposure time

195

is quite short, this is non-trivial. First, to validate whether the thermocouple inserted into the T-

196

junction of the SS tube (called T-thermocouple here) can accurately measure the solution

197

temperature inside the SS tube, a solution with known temperature, set by heating the bulk of the

198

solution in a temperature-controlled water bath, was drawn into the SS tubing at various flow

199

speeds and its temperature was measured. This measured temperature inside the SS tubing (2 cm

200

away from the heated water bath) was then compared to that of the bulk solution temperature.

201

Fig. S1-B in the ESI shows these calibration curves. The results show that the temperature probe

202

accurately measures the solution temperature inside the SS tube. For example, at a fast flow of

203

0.1 s exposure, which minimizes any cooling of the solution outside of the water bath, the
7

bioRxiv preprint doi: https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.10.05.327528; this version posted October 6, 2020. The copyright holder for this preprint

204

measured temperature was almost identical to the water bath temperature (Fig. S1-B, 0.1 s

205

condition, 97.8 ℃ real temperature = 97.7 ℃ measured temperature). Second, as the flow rate

206

becomes slower (i.e., longer exposure to heat), it is expected that the solution will cool down

207

slightly the moment it leaves the SS tubing section immersed inside the water bath. Indeed, the

208

measurement result shows that as the exposure time increases to 0.25, 0.5, and 1 s, the measured

209

temperature becomes slightly lower than the water bath temperature. For example, for water bath

210

temperature of 98 ℃ and exposure time of 0.25, 0.5, and 1 s, the T-thermocouple temperature

211

reading was 95.4, 94.5, and 92.6 ℃, showing the slight cooling of the temperature. Therefore,

212

the real-time measured temperatures were corrected by the calibration curves (Fig. S1-B), which

213

were used as the actual temperatures applied.

214
215

3.2 COMSOL simulation

216

The heat transfer efficiency and temperature profile within the SS capillary tubing are important

217

to understand the actual heating condition of the viral solution. We used COMSOL

218

MultiphysicsTM to simulate the heat transfer from the SS tubing to the flowing CoV solution

219

inside the tubing. Fig. 2 (A) shows the temperature change of flowing virus solution within the

220

SS tubing when the oil bath temperature was set to 125 ℃ and a moderate exposure time of 0.5 s

221

(flow rate = 92300 µl/hr) was used. Here, the SS tubing temperature increases rapidly as it enters

222

the oil bath (pink zone), then gradually drops when the tubing is exposed to air (yellow zone),

223

and then rapidly drops as it enters the ice bath (blue zone). The reason the SS temperature inside

224

the oil bath (pink zone) is not same as the oil bath temperature is due to the cooling effect of

225

room temperature water continuously flowing into the tubing, especially since the length of the

226

tubing immersed inside the oil bath was relatively short (5 cm). Using a much longer tubing
8

227

inside the oil bath would have eventually made the SS tubing temperature same as the oil bath

228

temperature, but that makes it impossible to apply a short temperature exposure time, hence the

229

use of a relatively short tubing length.

230

The solution temperature follows the SS tubing temperature relatively closely. The highest

231

solution temperature of 87 ℃ was achieved right as it comes out from the oil bath and maintains

232

its temperature relatively well (temperature drop of 6.5 °C over a 10 cm length), until arriving at

233

the segment of the SS tubing immersed in the ice bath. Therefore, the effective heat treatment

234

region was designated from the highest temperature point post-oil bath and right before the ice

235

bath treatment, a length of 9.5 cm. While the “applied exposure time” is calculated based on the

236

tubing length immersed in the oil bath (5.0 cm), the simulated actual exposure time is 1.9 times

237

longer than the set time, in this case 0.95 s (when the applied treatment time was set to 0.5 s).

238

Fig. 2 (B) exhibits the temperature distribution under the condition of 170 ℃ oil bath

239

temperature and “set exposure time” of 0.1 s (flow rate = 461500 µl/h). Even though the set

240

temperature was higher, due to five times faster flow rate of incoming room temperature solution,

241

the SS tubing temperature only reached 56 ℃ due to the larger cooling effect coming from the

242

incoming solution. This effect can also be seen by the drop in the SS tubing temperature as it

243

exits out of the oil bath. As in the previous case, the highest solution temperature of 56 ℃ was at

244

the point where the SS tubing exits the oil bath, with minimum drop in temperature until it enters

245

the ice bath. Thus, as before, the effective heat treatment region could be designated from the

246

highest temperature point post-oil bath and right before the ice bath treatment, a length of ~ 9.5

247

cm. The temperature comparison table summarizes (Table S1, ESI) the oil bath set temperature,

248

the real-time T-junction temperature sensor readout of the CoV solution, the calibrated CoV

249

solution temperature to accommodate the cooling effect, and the simulated temperature.

3.3 Heat inactivation of MHV

257

As reported, an average viral load of SARS-CoV-2 is 7 × 106 per milliliter (26), therefore we

258

chose 5 × 107 PFU/mL of MHV which is slightly higher and would provide a rigorous test of this

259

rapid heat inactivation system. Our study investigated rapid heat treatment, within one second, to

260

demonstrate effective coronavirus inactivation, by flowing MHV virus solution through stainless

261

tubing immersed in an oil with temperatures ranging from 55 ℃ to 170 ℃. We found that the

262

coronavirus particles were inactivated efficiently (> 6 Log10 reduction) by applying an oil bath

263

temperature of 115 ℃ and residence time for 1 s. When the heat exposure time decreased to 0.5 s,

264

a temperature of 125 ℃ or higher is needed to completely inactivate the MHV. When the heat

265

exposure time further decreased to 0.25 s, the virus titer reduction is 5 Log10 at 150 ℃ treatment.

266

However, when the heat exposure time reduced to 0.1 s, the MHV in the capillary stainless-steel

267

could not be sufficiently inactivated even when the oil bath temperature was increased to 170 ℃.

268

Therefore, the remaining infectivity after heat treatments comparing different conditions was re-

269

plotted by the actual thermal treatment temperature and duration, and is shown in Fig. 3. Among

270

the set oil bath temperatures ranging from 55 ℃ to 170 ℃, the shortest treatment time required

to inactivate the MHV effectively (> 5 Log10 reduction) was concluded as 0.25 s (0.48 s as

272

simulated), with an actual exposure temperature of 85.2 ℃. Furthermore, the most rapid thermal

273

treatment to completely inactivate the MHV (> 6 Log10 reduction and the remaining titer is 0

274

PFU/mL) is 0.5 s (0.95 s as simulated), with an actual exposure temperature of 83.4 ℃.

277

different heat inactivation conditions (A) by oil bath temperature and set exposure time; (B) by

actual temperature and exposure time from real-time measurement. Virus titers were averaged

279

from three independent biological replicates (n = 3), and error bars indicate standard deviations.

Table 1 summarizes the inactivation effectiveness under different heat treatment conditions,

281

where our results were shaded. Generally, coronaviruses are relatively stable at room

282

temperature and are sensitive to heat when the temperature increased to 65 ℃, after which the

283

sensitivity destruction linked to temperature became obvious. As the small increases in

284

temperature (after 65 ℃) cause a large increase in death rate, and temperature experienced by the

285

viruses would not equal the applied heating temperature (27), our study fills the gap of sub-

286

second heat treatment under applied actual temperature.

4 Conclusion

292

We studied the thermal treatment conditions to efficiently inactivate a coronavirus and developed

293

a system and protocol that can inactivate infectibility of MHV. We successfully developed an

294

experimental setup that allows applying sub-second duration of heat to the CoV solution where

295

the temperature applied to the CoV solution can be monitored in real time. Through experimental

296

measurement and computational thermal simulation, we validated the real temperature that the

297

CoV solutions are exposed to. Using this setup, we identified that 85.2 ℃ for 0.48 s exposure is

298

sufficient to obtain > 5 Log10 reduction in viral titer (starting titer: 5 × 107 PFU/mL), and that

299

when exposed to 83.4 ℃ for 0.95 s, the virus was completely inactivated (zero titer, > 6 Log10

300

reduction). This is the first experimental result that shows that sub-second exposure to high

301

temperature is sufficient to inactive the infectibility of CoV. Since heat treatment is a simple,

302

inexpensive, and efficient approach to inactivate coronaviruses, our method can be used to study

303

the thermal sensitivity of viruses, as well as providing critical data that can be used to develop

304

efficient CoV heat inactivation methods that can be broadly applied to real-world settings.
