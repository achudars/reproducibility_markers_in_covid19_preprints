Transcriptomic profiling from publicly available RNA-seq count data revealed a sitespecific immune response in COVID-19.

•

Host response was found cellular-mediated in nasopharyngeal samples and humoralmediated in PBMCs samples.

Abstract
Introduction: Over 24 million people have been infected globally with the novel coronavirus,
SARS-CoV-2, with more than 820,000 succumbing to the resulting COVID-19 disease as of the
end of August 2020. The molecular mechanisms underlying the pathogenesis of the disease are not
completely elucidated. Thus, we aim to understand host response to SARS-CoV-2 infection by
comparing samples collected from two distinct compartments (infection site and blood), obtained
from COVID-19 subjects and healthy controls. Methods: We used two publicly available gene

expression datasets generated via RNA sequencing in two different samples; nasopharyngeal swabs
and peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs). We performed a differential gene expression
analysis between COVID-19 subjects and healthy controls in the two datasets and then functionally
profiled their differentially expressed genes (DEGs). The genes involved in innate immunity were
also determined. Results: We found a clear difference in the host response to SARS-CoV-2
infection between the two sample groups. In COVID-19 subjects, the nasopharyngeal sample group
indicated upregulation of genes involved in cytokine activity and interferon signalling pathway, as
well as downregulation of genes involved in oxidative phosphorylation and viral transcription. Host
response in COVID-19 subjects for the PBMC group, involved upregulation of genes involved in
the complement system and immunoglobulin mediated immune response. CXCL13, GABRE,
IFITM3 were upregulated and HSPA1B was downregulated in COVID-19 subjects in both sample
groups. Conclusion: Our results indicate the host response to SARS-CoV-2 is compartmentalized
and suggests potential biomarkers of response to SARS-CoV-2 infection.

1.Introduction
The ongoing global pandemic in 2020, is a viral outbreak of severe acute respiratory syndrome
coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), with over 24 million confirmed cases that account for more than
820,000 confirmed deaths across the world (Pharmaceutical Technology, 2020). SARS-CoV-2
belongs to the coronavirus family (Coronaviridae) of viruses that cause mild or fatal respiratory
tract infections in humans. The virus is contagious and infects humans by entering the cells through
the attachment of its spike proteins to angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) receptors found
on surface of the cell (Mathewson et al., 2008; Shereen et al., 2020; Wang et al., 2020). The clinical
manifestations of the disease caused by SARS-CoV-2, coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19)
include fever, dry cough, breathing difficulties (dyspnoea), headache and fatigue (Lima, 2020;
CDC, 2019). Other symptoms observed in some patients are sore throat in the prominent upper
respiratory tract, sneezing, anosmia and rhinorrhoea (Huang et al., 2020, Hornuss et al., 2020; Lee
et al., 2020; Lechien et al., 2020).
Although there is an expression of interferon (IFN) in other coronavirus infections (Newton et al.,
2016; Nelemans & Kikkert, 2019), some studies on the immune response to viral infections in
addition to the newly understanding of SARS-CoV-2, established that the virus suppresses various
mechanisms in the interferon pathway thereby preventing the pattern recognition receptors (PRR),
signalling and inhibiting host protein translation (Newton et al., 2016; Nelemans & Kikkert, 2019;
Lei et al., 2020; Mantlo et al., 2020). Previous studies also established that triggering of such

bioRxiv preprint doi: https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.09.09.289850; this version posted September 9, 2020. The copyright holder for this

exuberant inflammatory responses in the host leads to severe lung disease (Channappanavar et al.,
2016). Most COVID-19 patients with severe clinical presentation and poor prognosis exhibit
dysregulated host immune response and enhanced levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines known as
the “cytokine storm” (Huang et al., 2020). Recent studies done by Haung et al. (2020) and Xiong
et al. (2020) also demonstrated elevated amounts of plasma IL2, IL6, IL7, IL10, GCSF, IP10,
MCP1, MIP1A, and TNFα in severe cases of COVID-19 compared to mild cases, showing
inflammatory cytokines release to be significantly associated with COVID-19 progression (Huang
et al., 2020, Xiong et al., 2020).
Transcriptome profiling allows the evaluation of gene expression changes in response to disease or
treatment (Voineagu et al. 2011). Transcriptome profiling of 8356 cells collected from COVID-19
patients and healthy controls revealed that COVID-19 patients exhibited abnormalities in their
bronchoalveolar epithelial cells and that the SARS-CoV-2 virus suppresses gene expression in host
cells (He et al., 2020). However, the underlying molecular mechanisms of the inflammatory
responses and pathogenesis of the COVID-19 in SARS-CoV-2 infection are not clearly understood.
Thus, analysing host transcriptional changes in response to SARS-CoV-2 infection is necessary to
help describe the biological process underlying the pathogenesis of COVID-19.
In this study, we performed transcriptomic analysis of different samples sources from both COVID19 patients and healthy controls (Figure 1). We show that transcriptional response to SARS-CoV2 infection in the two different compartments are distinct and reflect a local inflammation in
nasopharyngeal site and circulating immune response in peripheral blood mononuclear cells
(PBMC) samples in COVID-19 patients.

Material and Methods

2.1. Study design and datasets

bioRxiv preprint doi: https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.09.09.289850; this version posted September 9, 2020. The copyright holder for this

This is a secondary study from publicly available data. Gene expression data (RNA-Seq counts) of
GSE152418 and GSE152075 datasets were downloaded from the NCBI Gene Expression Omnibus
(GEO) database. The GSE152075 dataset was generated by RNA sequencing of nasopharyngeal
swab samples from COVID-19 subjects and healthy controls (Randhawa et al., 2020; Lieberman
et al., 2020). The dataset was composed of 430 nasopharyngeal swab samples of COVID-19
subjects and 54 of healthy controls. The median age (years) of the COVID-19 patients enrolled in
the study was 54 [2 - 98] in which the majority was female (43%; unknown: 12%) (Lieberman et
al., 2020). The GSE152418 dataset was generated by RNA sequencing of PBMCs from COVID19 subjects and healthy controls (Arunachalam et al., 2020). The dataset was composed of 16
PBMC samples of COVID-19 subjects and of 17 healthy controls. The median age (years) of the
COVID-19 patients was 56 [25 - 94] with a majority of male (55%) (Arunachalam et al., 2020).
SARS-CoV-2 infection was confirmed by RT-PCR in both studies. Nasopharyngeal samples were
collected in the emergency departments on admission of the patients and PBMC samples during
hospitalization.

2.2. Differentially expressed gene (DEGs) analysis
DEGs analysis was performed on the control and disease samples in each nasopharyngeal and
PBMC group using the DESeq2 package in R (Love et al., 2014). Genes that fulfilled the criteria
of an adjusted p-value < 0.05 and a threshold of log2 fold change > 1 were considered significant.
Ensembl IDs were converted to HUGO Gene Nomenclature Committee (HGNC) symbols using
the g: Convert tool in g: Profiler (Raudvere et al., 2019). The common DEGs in both the
nasopharyngeal and PBMC samples were identified. An ensemble of hierarchical and k-means
clustering was then applied to these common DEGs to determine their discriminatory utility of the
samples into their respective sample groups (i.e. Nasopharyngeal or PBMC). The DEGs were also
searched for their involvement in innate immunity using the InnateDB database (Breuer et al.,
2013).

2.3. Gene enrichment analysis
Functional profiling of the upregulated and downregulated DEGs in the two sample groups were
carried out using the g:GOSt tool in g: Profiler (Raudvere et al., 2019) with adjusted p-value < 0.05
set as cut off for significant terms.

2.4. Expression of the results
The results were expressed in tables, graphs and illustrations when convenient. Heatmaps of the
top 20 genes (10 up regulated and 10 down regulated) in both datasets were plotted using iDEP.91
server. The hkmeans and dendrogram plot functions were applied to a normalised data matrix of
both nasopharyngeal and PBMC samples using software Orange Data Mining (Ljubljana
University). Functional analysis was plotted using Prism (GraphPad software, Inc).

Results

3.1. Transcriptome profiling of host response to SARS-CoV-2 infection from nasopharyngeal
and PBMC samples
An overview of the gene expression in nasopharyngeal and PBMCs sample groups was observed
in the principal component analysis (PCA), which suggests how significant the variation among
the gene expression was between the two groups (Figure 2). In nasopharyngeal samples, we
observed a separation between healthy controls and COVID-19 subjects along the second principal
component, although substantial overlap between groups remained (Figure 2, A). A distinct cluster
between healthy controls and cases was observed in the PBMC sample group (Figure 2, B). Next,
we performed a differential gene expression analysis relative to matched healthy controls, to

explore host response to SARS-CoV-2 infection (Figure 2). In the nasopharyngeal sample group,
745 genes were differentially expressed, of which 166 were upregulated, and 579 were
downregulated (Figure 2, C). In the PBMC sample group, 532 genes were differentially expressed,
of which 524 were upregulated and 8 were downregulated (Figure 2, D).
3.2. SARS-CoV-2 infection induces a differential expression pattern in nasopharyngeal and
PBMC sample groups
From the number of differentially expressed genes, we next sought to contrast and explore the
quantitative changes between the sample groups relative to respective healthy controls. The top
significant DEGs evidence a distinct expression pattern in the two sample groups (Figure 3, Tables
S1 and S2). Thirteen DEGs including CLU, CXCL13, GABRE, HSPA1B, IFITM3, IGHA2, IGHG1,
IGHG3, ITGB5, MT1E, SELENBP1, TXNDC5 and UCHL1 were found to be commonly expressed
between both sample groups. These genes encode for immunoglobulins, chemokines, ubiquitin,
and proteins responsible for stress response and protein degradation. The genes CXCL13, GABRE
and IFITM3, were upregulated in COVID-19 subjects in both sample groups. The genes CLU,
IGHA2, IGHG1, IGHG3, ITGB5, MT1E, SELENBP1, TXNDC5 and UCHL1 were upregulated in
COVID-19 subjects in the PBMC group but downregulated in COVID-19 subjects in the
nasopharyngeal sample group. HSPA1B was downregulated in both sample groups. The expression
pattern of these 13 commonly DEGs consistently discriminated nasopharyngeal and PBMC
samples amongst the COVID-19 subjects by hierarchical clustering (Figure 3, C).

3.3. Host immune and metabolic response to SARS-CoV-2 infection
To evaluate biological relevance, we enriched the interaction between the DEGs. Functional
profiling of the nasopharyngeal upregulated DEGs identified significant terms such as chemokine
activity, cytokine activity, inflammatory response, and type 1 interferon signalling pathway (Figure
4, A), indicating a cellular-mediated immune response. Functional profiling of the upregulated

bioRxiv preprint doi: https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.09.09.289850; this version posted September 9, 2020. The copyright holder for this

DEGs in COVID-19 subjects in the PBMC group identified significant terms such as
immunoglobulin receptor binding, B cell-mediated immunity, complement activation,
haemoglobin binding, oxygen carrier activity and cell division (Figure 4, B). The transcriptional
profile shown by PBMCs reflects a humoral and complement mediated response against SARSCoV-2 infection. Ninety-two (92) of the DEGs in the nasopharyngeal group were found to be
involved in innate immunity, of which 53 were upregulated, and 39 were downregulated.
Functional profiling of the downregulated DEGs in the nasopharyngeal sample identified
significant terms such as RNA binding, oxidoreductase activity, cytochrome-c-oxidase activity,
oxidative phosphorylation, viral transcription and selenocysteine synthesis (Table S5). There were
only 8 downregulated genes in the PBMCs sample group and they were not functionally enriched.
Forty-three (43) of the DEGs in the COVID-19 subjects in the PBMC sample group were found to
be involved in innate immunity and were all upregulated. Result tables of functional profiling of
DEGs are available in the Supplementary Tables S3 to S5. In summary, functional profiling of the
DEGs involved in innate immunity in both sample groups identified terms indicating host response
to the viral challenge, but distinct pathways of the immune response. For nasopharyngeal sample
groups, the events suggest a cellular-mediated immune response, whereas a humoral-mediated
response was observed in the PBMC sample group (Figure 5).

Discussion

This study was designed to analyse host transcriptional changes in response to COVID-19 from
publicly available datasets, to contribute to the knowledge of the biological processes underlying
the pathogenesis of COVID-19 and the immune responses elicited. Our results showed a distinct
immune response in nasopharyngeal samples and PBMC samples in COVID-19 patients, as
evidenced by the differential expression pattern. We have shown that apart from a
compartmentalized and site-specific immune response, there was a set of genes commonly
regulated in the two sample groups. These observations are in line with previous reports in which
SARS-CoV-2 infection induces a highly inflammatory environment observed in nasopharyngeal

samples and an innate immune response played by complement system in PBMCs (Blanco-Melo
et al., 2020; Xiong et al., 2020).

We showed that nasopharyngeal samples exhibited a regulation for local inflammation, compatible
with the tropism of SARS-CoV-2 to nasal epithelial cells (Sungnak et al., 2020). This response was
shown to be specific at the infection site, that likely reflect in complementary and systemic elements
of immune response in the periphery, as indicated in this study. The infection by SARS-CoV-2 is
marked by a systemic inflammatory response that affects various organs in different manners
(Gardinassi et al., 2020). Although the elevated inflammatory response may be beneficial in
fighting the infection, it may also lead to an over-production of pro-inflammatory cytokines that
may cause damage to the olfactory epithelium, as well as adverse outcomes such as alveolar
damage, respiratory failure and multiple organ dysfunction (Chen et al., 2017.; Huang et al., 2020;
Xiong et al., 2020). Cytokines have been shown to contribute to leukocyte recruitment via
activating integrins, promoting migration of adherent leukocytes across endothelium and through
the extracellular matrix (Butcher et al., 1996). Therefore, cytokine and chemokine expression in
the nasopharynx is possibly associated with the finding of upregulation of leukocytes migration.
Blanco-Melo and colleagues (2020), observed a strong chemokine expression in transcriptomic
profile from nasopharyngeal swabs and low levels of IFN-I. In contrast to that, through the
functional profiling in nasopharyngeal samples, we observed an activity regulated by Type I
Interferon. In this study, the soluble levels of IFN-I were not addressed, but a possible
counterbalance played by upregulation of anti-inflammatory signalling by IL-10 could be in line to
what was observed by Blanco-Melo and colleagues (2020). Hachim et al. (2020) also reported that
genes, especially the IFITM3 gene, involved in IFN response to a viral infection such as type 1
interferon signalling pathway, were upregulated in SARS-CoV-2 infected lung epithelial cells. This
further elucidates the release of IFN by the innate immune system in response to viral RNAs, such
as is the case with SARS-CoV-2 (Nelemans & Kikkert, 2019). Further investigation on the

mechanism of recruitment and effector function of responding cells is required in order to better
understand the process. The biological processes found in PBMCs are consistently directed towards
a humoral-mediated response. Xiong and colleagues (2020) reported similar results from PBMCs,
with the observation that genes upregulated in PBMCs of COVID-19 patients were enriched in
complement activation, B cell-mediated immunity, and immunoglobulin-mediated humoral
immune response. These results indicate a highly specific immune response in periphery. Indeed,
Stahel and Barnum (2020) pointed out the importance of the complement system in the
pathogenesis of COVID-19. Our results support the need for further studies to uncover the exact
mechanism of the complement system in COVID-19.

A molecular signature is observed in the heatmap from PBMCs, albeit not so clearly in
nasopharyngeal samples. The sample size, higher in nasopharyngeal sampling, may reflect
heterogeneous observations from possible diverse clinical presentations. The fact we have found a
specific cellular-mediated immune response in nasopharyngeal samples, even in a heterogeneous
group of patients, reinforces the importance of the finding of commonly dysregulated genes with
the PBMC sample group. Heat Shock Protein Family A (Hsp70) Member 1B - HSPA1B was
downregulated in both sample groups. HSPA1B codes for a molecular chaperone that plays a vital
role in cellular processes including protection of protein from stress and protein quality control
system including correct folding of proteins (Kim & Oglesbee, 2012; Scieglinska et al ., 2019). In
addition, it has been found that viral infection stimulates HSPA1B the gene to increase its own
replication (Kim & Oglesbee, 2012). Therefore, during the viral infection of SARS-CoV-2,
downregulation of HSP1AB might be an indirect immune response from the host to decrease the
viral load by reducing the rate of translation of viral protein molecules. We highlight the need of
further research to assess the effect of other RNA viruses on the expression of HSP1AB genes and
whether the suppression of the gene benefits the host against the viral infection. Chemokine (C-XC motif) ligand 13 - CXCL13 preferentially promotes migration of B lymphocytes into follicles.

Interferon Induced Transmembrane Protein 3 - IFITM3 is a protein-coding gene that disrupts the
intracellular cholesterol homeostasis and inhibits the entry of viruses to the cell cytoplasm by
hindering fusion of the virus with cholesterol depleted endosomes. IFITM3 is an interferon induced
gene that aids in providing immunity against the viral infections (Feeley et al., 2011). Together
with downregulated HSP1AB and the upregulated genes CXCL13 and IFITM3, we draw attention
to these molecules as potential biomarkers of disease progression. CXCL13 plays a vital role in the
migration of B cells during viral infection (Phares et al., 2016) and IFITM3 is also involved in
antiviral response (Zhang et al., 2020). This may be due to association with the activation of the
cytokine storm in infected patients during immune response (Gao et al., 2020; Huang et al., 2020;
Ruan et al., 2020). Nevertheless, Hachim et al. (2020) also reported an early upregulation of
IFITM3 in SARS-CoV-2 infected patients. Taken together, the roles in the infection played by these
commonly expressed genes at a critical site - possibly the entry route of viral-host interaction in
the nasopharynx raises the possibility of low invasive tests to investigate these genes in peripheral
blood and support personalized medicine.

Here, we provided insights on the potential use of transcriptomic data to address site-specific
differential gene expression in response to SARS-CoV-2. Our results direct the potential of markers
to discriminate sample source and differential host response to SARS-CoV-2 and possibly other
viral infections. Altogether, we suggest further investigation of whether the gene products can be
used as potential biomarkers as a COVID-19 screening process.

Conclusion

Using transcriptomic analysis, we identified differentially expressed genes between COVID-19
subjects in nasopharyngeal and PBMC sample groups in comparison to healthy controls. We also
illustrated the prominent immune response genes involved in SARS-CoV-2 infection in both
sample types. The differential expression profile observed between the sample groups suggests the

existence of different markers of the infection and which may possibly have diagnostic and/or
prognostic utility in COVID-19. However, further studies are required to fully characterise the
genes involved in the SARS-CoV-2 infection.

Figure 1. Schematic representation of the workflow in the present study. (1) Gene expression
data (RNA-Seq counts) of GSE152418 and GSE152075 datasets were downloaded from the NCBI
Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) database. (2) Differentially expressed gene (DEG) analysis was
performed on the control and disease sample groups in each nasopharyngeal and PBMC group
using the DESeq2 package in R. Genes that fulfilled the criteria of an adjusted p-value < 0.05 and
a threshold of log2 fold change > 1 were considered significant. (3) Ensembl IDs of DEGs were
converted to HUGO Gene Nomenclature Committee (HGNC) symbols using the g: Convert tool
in g: Profiler. (4) An ensemble of hierarchical and k-means clustering was then applied to common
DEGs in both the nasopharyngeal and PBMC sample groups and DEGs were also searched for their
involvement in innate immunity using the InnateDB database. (5) Functional profiling of DEGs in
the two sample groups were carried out using the g:GOSt tool in g: Profiler with adjusted p-value
< 0.05 set as cut off for significant terms. (6) Associated gene ontology (GO), molecular function
(MF), biological process (BP), KEGG pathway, Reactome pathway, and WikiPathway was
identified for each dataset.

from functional profiling suggested an innate immunity profile in nasopharyngeal and PBMC
samples. Commonly expressed genes appear in upregulation of CXCL13, GABRE and IFITM3 and
downregulation of HSPA1B for both nasopharyngeal and PBMC samples, downregulation of CLU,
IGHA2, IGHG1, IGHG3, ITGB5, MT1E, SELENBP1, TXNDC5 and UCHL1 in nasopharyngeal
sample and upregulation in PBMC sample. The nasopharyngeal sample revealed an inflammatory
response cellular mediated against SARS-CoV-2 infection. Viral protein interaction between
cytokine and cytokine receptor occurs (1) in antigen-presenting cells, producing
cytokines/chemokines (2) and creating a signalling gradient to favour leukocyte migration (3) to
the site of infection. PBMCs sample displayed a humoral response, played by circulating
immunoglobulin production mediated by B cells (4) that promote antigen binding, activating the
classical pathway of complement system cascade (5). Creation of C4 and C2 activators occurs (6)
and cleavages into C2a and C4b (7) to initiate C3 and so on to complete the activation of the
complement cascade.
