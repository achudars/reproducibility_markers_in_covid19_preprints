Abstract

20

Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), a positive-sense single-stranded virus

21

approximately 30 kb in length, causes the ongoing novel coronavirus disease-2019 (COVID-19). Studies

22

confirmed significant genome differences between SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV, suggesting that the

23

distinctions in pathogenicity might be related to genomic diversity. However, the relationship between

24

genomic differences and SARS-CoV-2 fitness has not been fully explained, especially for open reading frame

25

(ORF)-encoded accessory proteins. RNA viruses have a high mutation rate, but how SARS-CoV-2 mutations

26

accelerate adaptation is not clear. This study shows that the host-genome similarity (HGS) of SARS-CoV-2

27

is significantly higher than that of SARS-CoV, especially in the ORF6 and ORF8 genes encoding proteins

28

antagonizing innate immunity in vivo. A power law relationship was discovered between the HGS of ORF3b,

29

ORF6, and N and the expression of interferon (IFN)-sensitive response element (ISRE)-containing

30

promoters. This finding implies that high HGS of SARS-CoV-2 genome may further inhibit IFN I synthesis

31

and cause delayed host innate immunity. An ORF1ab mutation, 10818G>T, which occurred in virus

32

populations with high HGS but rarely in low-HGS populations, was identified in 2594 genomes with

33

geolocations of China, the USA and Europe. The 10818G>T caused the amino acid mutation M37F in the

34

transmembrane protein nsp6. The results suggest that the ORF6 and ORF8 genes and the mutation M37F

35

may play important roles in causing COVID-19. The findings demonstrate that HGS analysis is a promising

36

way to identify important genes and mutations in adaptive strains, which may help in searching potential

37

targets for pharmaceutical agents.

Introduction

39

In December 2019, a novel coronavirus SARS-CoV-2 was reported as the cause of COVID-19. SARS-CoV-2

40

has a positive-sense single-stranded RNA with a length of approximately 30 kb[1]. Studies have shown that

41

considerable genetic diversity exists between SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV[1, 2]. Compared with SARS-

2

42

CoV, SARS-CoV-2 appears to be more contagious and more adapted to humans[3]. The distinctions in

43

pathogenicity and virulence might be related to genomic diversity.

44

RNA viruses are susceptible to genetic recombination, and viral populations may evolve improved

45

adaptability in the process of infecting hosts. By comparing the genome similarity of the virus to the host,

46

the adaptability of the virus to the host can be inferred. Although the genomes of viruses and hosts are quite

47

different in general, nucleotide sequence similarities do exist. Such similarities may have three biological

48

significances. (1) These similar fragments come from a common ancestor and remain stable over long-term

49

evolution due to their biological significance. (2) Similar genomic fragments are coincidentally preserved in

50

both viruses and hosts over time because of the biological benefits of the gene products. (3) When the virus

51

interacts with the hosts, mutants are created by virus-host gene exchanges, causing genome similarities.

52

A growing number of studies on virus-host gene similarity have been reported. Simian virus 40 (SV40), the

53

first animal virus to undergo complete full-sequence DNA analysis, can infect monkeys and humans and

54

cause tumors[4]. Rosenberg et al.[5] found that some mutant SV40 viruses contained nucleic acid sequences

55

from their host monkeys. This finding suggests that viruses can recombine with host genes to complete their

56

own physiological processes, which makes up for a lack of function or increases virulence. Genes similar to

57

specific fragments of the human genome in molluscum contagiosum virus (MCV) have been reported[6].

58

MCV is a human poxvirus and lacks the genes associated with virus-host interactions in other poxvirus

59

species (variola virus). However, genes in MCV with high similarity to specific fragments of the human

60

genome are also hard to find in other poxviruses. These host-like genes may provide MCV-specific strategies

61

for coexistence with the host[6]. In other words, it is very likely that viruses use host-specific genes to perform

62

activities related to virus-host interactions, such as evasion of the host innate immune system. When human

63

peripheral blood DNA was used as a template for polymerase chain reaction (PCR), 5 of 6 samples could be

64

amplified by Epstein-Barr virus (EBV)- or hepatitis C virus (HCV)-specific primers[7]. Therefore, it is

65

speculated that some genes of the two viruses may also exist in the human genome or that the viruses may

66

have homology with human genes. This hypothesis implies that not only can the virus have the host's genes

67

but also the host itself may have genes from the virus.

68

Selection pressure exerted by the host immune system plays an important role in shaping virus

69

mutations. Homology between virus and host proteins indicates the presence of host gene capture.

70

Evolution of viral genes may involve intergenome gene transfer and intragenome gene

71

duplication[8]. By acquiring immune modulation genes from cells, viruses have evolved proteins

72

that can regulate or inhibit the host's immune system[9, 10]. A recent study showed that human

73

genome evolution was shaped by viral infections[11]. In mammals, nearly 30% of the adaptive

74

amino acid changes in the human proteome are caused by viruses, suggesting that viruses are one

75

of the major driving factors for the evolution of mammalian and human proteomes[12]. These

76

findings support the possibility that SARS-CoV-2 may exchange genetic information with host

77

cells. It can be inferred that most of the traits and mechanisms retained in "coevolution" between

78

viruses and their hosts, including genetic and mutational mechanisms, benefit at least one or both.

79

At the molecular level of evolution, the exchange of genetic information is necessary for virus-host

80

mutual adaptation, leading to the similarity of nucleotide sequences.

88

The accessory protein genes play a key role in inhibiting the innate immune response in vivo and

89

are more susceptible than the other genes to species-specific mutations under the pressure of

90

evolutionary selection. Once inside the cell, the virus immediately confronts other critical proteins

91

known as host-restriction factors (HRFs)[13]. HRFs are proteins that recognize and block viral

92

replication. Virus-host interactions control species specificity and viral infection ability. Under

93

pressure from the host immune system, viruses must be able to overcome a range of constraints

94

associated with the host species and often show evolutionary mutation selections. It is hypothesized

95

that accessory ORFs may retain beneficial mutations to increase host-genome similarity (HGS).

96

Identifying emerging genetic mutations in virus populations with high HGS may aid the

97

understanding of how SARS-CoV-2 evolved adaptation to humans. To the best of our knowledge,

98

studies on the genetic similarity between SARS-CoV-2 and the human genome have not been

99

reported.

100

This study investigated the HGS of SARS-CoV-2 genes and elucidated the links between HGS and

101

virus adaptation to humans. A power law relationship was discovered between the expression of

102

genes with interferon (IFN)-stimulated response elements (ISREs) and HGS. ORFs with higher

103

HGS suppressed the gene expression of ISRE-regulated genes to a greater extent. Applying HGS

104

analysis to 2594 SARS-CoV-2 genomes from China, the USA and Europe, it was found that the

105

ORF6 and ORF8 genes of SARS-CoV-2 had more significant HGS increments than SARS-CoV.

106

In addition, three different sets of surviving mutations were identified in SARS-CoV-2 genomes

107

for China, the USA and Europe. Interestingly, an ORF1ab mutation, 10818G>T, which resulted in

108

the residue mutation M37F in the transmembrane protein nsp6, was observed in virus populations

109

of all three regions. This mutation did not occur in strain populations with low HGS but gradually

110

appeared in populations with high HGS. This finding provides strong evidence that SARS-CoV-2

111

may accelerate adaptation in humans through increasing HGS of the ORF6 and ORF8 genes and

112

selecting the M37F mutation. However, the underlying mechanism by which these genes and

113

mutations make SARS-CoV-2 more adapted to humans remains unclear.

Viral genome data

116

By using BLAST ORFfinder[14], 31 ORFs were detected in the RNA genome sequence (29903 nt) of SARS-

117

CoV-2 (GenBank: MN908947.3). Only ATG was used as the ORF start codon, and nested ORFs were

118

ignored. Among all the ORFs in the SARS-CoV-2 sequence, we selected the longest 14 as targets, whose

119

lengths were no less than 75 nt. For genome comparison, ORFs in the SARS-CoV genome with a length of

120

29728 nt (GenBank: AY394850.2) were also identified. There were 19 ORFs with lengths no less than 75 nt

121

in the SARS-CoV sequence.

122

The SARS-CoV-2 genomes were obtained from the GISAID database[15]. By May 20, 2020, the GISAID

123

database (https://www.gisaid.org/) had 416 SARS-CoV-2 genomes from China, 5184 genomes from the USA

124

and 10954 genomes from Europe. Complete and high-coverage genomes were used to ensure accurate HGS

125

calculations. The sequences containing nucleotide names other than A, G, C and T were removed from the

126

dataset. In total, 2594 SARS-CoV-2 genomes were used in the current study, including 200 from China, 1538

127

from the USA and 856 from Europe. The CDSs of the SARS-CoV-2 genome were identified by using

128

MATLAB (https://www.mathworks.com/help/bioinfo/ref/seqshoworfs.html). The accession IDs of the

129

genomes used in the article can be found in the Supplemental Information.

130

Human SARS-CoV genomes were collected from NCBI GenBank[16]. There were 25 CDSs of SARS-CoVs

131

(full-length sequences only, with all ORF sequences, no nucleotide names other than A, G, C and T) at the

132

time of article preparation. The accession IDs of these viral sequences can be found in the Supplemental

133

Information.

The target CDSs were aligned with the human genome (Homo sapiens GRCh38.p12 chromosomes) by

136

Blastn[17] to obtain matching fragments. Blastn sequence alignment gives an original score of S. To facilitate

137

the comparison of Blast results among different subgenomic groups, the original score is standardized to S'

Here, the E value represents the expected number of times when two random sequences of length m and n

are matched and the score is not lower than S'. Parameters K and λ describe the statistical significance of the

143

results[18]. Assuming that the fragment of length

a matches perfectly in the two random sequences, one has

Since the viral genome is quite different from the human genome, matching fragments are usually very short.

SARS-CoV-2 ORFs have higher HGS than those of SARS-CoV

161

The SARS-CoV-2 (GenBank: MN908947.3) and SARS-CoV (GenBank: AY394850.2) RNA sequences

162

were used as references to establish the genome organization. SARS-CoV-2 has 14 5’-ORFs, while SARS-

163

CoV has 19 5’-ORFs. The length of each ORF is no less than 75 nt (Table 1).

164

A quantitative definition of HGS was proposed to investigate the similarity between viral coding sequences

165

(CDSs) and the human genome (Homo sapiens GRCh38.p12 chromosomes). The CDS alignment scores were

166

determined by using NCBI Blastn[17], and HGS was calculated by the formulas described in the Methods

167

for each ORF in the coronavirus genome. The overall HGS of a full-length virus genome was obtained by

168

the weighted sum of ORF HGSs. The weighting factor was the ratio of ORF length to the full-genome length.

The HGS of ORFs was calculated for 2594 SARS-CoV-2 genomes with geolocation from China, the USA

174

and Europe. Phylogenetic trees representing the HGS relationship among virus strains are shown in Fig 1,

175

Fig 2 and Fig 3 for all three regions. The tree clusters were formed based on the distance between vectors

176

containing ORF HGS values. Most of the genomes had moderate HGS values. Genomes with similar HGS

177

values were usually in the same cluster and shared a common ancestor. The genomes with high HGS were

178

not all concentrated in the same cluster but may form several separate populations in the tree.

The full-length genome data were obtained from the Global Initiative on Sharing All Influenza Data

198

(GISAID) database[15]. The sequence requirements were full-length sequences only, sequences with definite

199

collection dates and locations, and no nucleotide names other than A, G, C and T. The number of genomes

200

that met such requirements was 200 for China, 1538 for the USA and 856 for Europe at the time of article

201

preparation. The HGS of human SARS-CoV genomes was also calculated. In NCBI GenBank[16], a total of

202

25 SARS-CoV CDSs met the above sequence requirements.

203

Fig 4 shows that ORF 7b of SARS-CoV had the highest similarity with the human genome, followed by

204

ORF6, ORF7a, ORF3a and ORF 8. For SARS-CoV-2, ORF 7b, ORF 6 and ORF 8 were the top 3 genes with

205

the highest HGSs. The mean HGS values of ORF6 and ORF8 in SARS-CoV-2 increased significantly,

206

reaching 122% and 148% of those of SARS-CoV ORF6 and ORF8, respectively Fig 4. The roles of such

207

HGS changes are not clear. However, by investigating the function of the SARS-CoV viral genes and

208

proteins, the mechanism of the rapid spread of the newly emerged COVID-19 may be inferred from the HGS

209

changes in SARS-CoV-2 genomes.

214

Studies have shown that ORF6 suppresses the induction of IFN and signaling pathways[19]. A membrane

215

protein with 63 amino acids, ORF 6 blocked the IFNAR-STAT signaling pathway by limiting the mobility

216

of the importin subunit KPNB1 and preventing the STAT1 complex from moving into the nucleus for ISRE

217

activation[20]. Laboratory studies confirmed that the expression of ORF 6 transformed a sublethal infection

218

into lethal encephalitis and enhanced the growth of the virus in cells[21]. In addition, ORF 6 circumvented

219

IFN production by inhibiting IRF-3 phosphorylation in the (TRAF3)-(TBK1+IKK)-(IRF3)-(IFNβ)

221

1/MDA5 and TLRs[22].

mainly by TLPs and RIG1/MDA5 and lead to type I IFN signaling pathway. The receptor

225

IFNAR senses type I IFN and leads to the JAK1-STAT signaling pathway, which expresses

antiviral proteins and bring neighboring cell into anti-virus state. The ORF6 suppresses type

227

I IFN expression by inhibiting translocation of STAT1+STAT2+IRF9 complex into nucleus.

ORF 6 also circumvent IFN production by inhibit IRF-3 phosphorylation in signaling

pathway (TRAF3)-(TBK1+IKK)-(IRF3)-(IFNβ). The expression of ORF8b and 8ab enhance

230

the IRF3 degradation, thus regulating immune functions of IRF3.

231

An intact gene, ORF8 encodes a single accessory protein at the early stage of SARS-CoV infection and splits

232

into two fragments, ORF8a and ORF8b, at later stages[23]. ORF8a and 8b have been observed in most SARS-

233

CoV-infected cells[24]. Wong et al.[25] found that the proteins ORF8b and ORF8ab in SARS-CoV inhibited

234

the IFN response during viral infection. It was also reported that ORF8b formed insoluble intracellular

235

aggregates and triggered cell death[26]. Amazingly, studies showed that SARS-CoV-related CoVs in

236

horseshoe bats had 95% genome identities to human and civet SARS-CoVs, but the ORF8 protein amino

237

acid similarities varied from 32% to 81%[27]. These findings indicate that the ORF8 gene is more prone than

238

other CoV genes to mutations in virus-host interactions. Overexpression of ORF 8b and ORF 8ab had a

239

significant effect on IRF3 dimerization rather than IRF3 phosphorylation[25]. The 8b region of SARS-CoV

240

protein ORF8 functions in ubiquitination binding, ubiquitination and glycosylation, which may interact with

241

IRF3[28]. The expression of ORF8b and 8ab enhanced IRF3 degradation, thus regulating the immune

242

functions of IRF3 (Fig 5). Interestingly, ORF8 is an IFN antagonist expressed in the later stage of SARS-

243

CoV infection. Studies showed that activation of IRF3 was blocked in the late stage of SARS-CoV infection,

244

which was consistent with the late expression of ORF8b. Therefore, the expression of ORF8 may help to

245

suppress the innate immune response that occurs in the later stages of infection and delay IFNβ signaling.

246

This may explain why the virus expresses a late-stage IFN antagonist, such as ORF8.

247

This work found that genes with high HGS were critical in suppressing innate immunity. Studies have shown

248

that the ORF3b, ORF6 and N proteins of SARS-CoV enhance suppression of IFNβ expression in host innate

249

immunity[29]. When IFN binds to the cell receptor IFNAR, the JAK/STAT signaling pathway is activated,

250

leading to activation of IFN-stimulated genes (ISGs) containing an ISRE in their promoter. Expression of

251

genes with an ISRE will trigger the production of hundreds of antiviral proteins inhibiting viral infections.

252

Therefore, a reduction in expression from ISRE-containing promoters is a direct indicator of the enhanced

253

ability to inhibit IFN synthesis.

254

ISRE-containing promoter expression after Sendai virus infection needs both IFN synthesis and signaling.

255

However, ISRE-containing promoter expression after IFN treatment requires only IFN signaling. In cells

256

treated with IFNβ, it was found that N did not significantly inhibit the expression of the ISRE promoter[29].

257

The expression level was approximately 78% of the value for the empty control. However, ORF3b and ORF6

258

still inhibited the expression of the ISRE promoter. We calculated the HGSs of ORF3b, ORF6 and N for

259

SARS-CoV. Amazingly, the results clearly demonstrated that the ISRE-containing promoter expression

260

decreased rapidly with increasing HGS (Fig 6), which provided evidence that there was a power law

261

dependence of IFN synthesis inhibition based on HGS. The ISRE-containing promoter expression data

262

followed the work of Kopecky-Bromberg et al.[29]. For 293T cells transfected with the SARS-CoV proteins

263

and infected by Sendai virus[29], IFN inhibition obeys the following power law equation:

264

P  0.004 H 0.539  5.421 , where H is the HGS value of the viral genes ORF3b, ORF6 and N, and P is

265

the expression of genes with an ISRE as a percentage of the value for the empty control. The power law

266

equation for cells treated with IFNβ is P  0.00001H 11.007  3.633 . The coefficient of determination R

267

reaches 1 for both data sets, indicating a perfect fit for the power law dependence on HGS.

Fig 6. Inhibition of a promoter containing an ISRE by SARS-CoV proteins with different

genome HGS values. Cells were cotransfected with the SARS-CoV proteins and either

271

infected with Sendai virus (S. virus) or treated with IFN after 24 hours. The expression of

272

the promoter decays rapidly with the increasing HGS of ORF 3b, ORF 6 and N, conforming

273

to a power law.

274

The findings suggested that HGS, i.e., similarity between the virus and host genome, is a reliable indicator

275

of the suppression of innate immunity by viral proteins. Channappanavar et al. found that rapid SARS-CoV

276

replication and a relative delay in IFN I signaling resulted in immune dysregulation and severe disease in

277

infected mice[30]. Considering the significant HGS increments of ORF6 and ORF8 and their roles in

278

suppressing innate immunity, it could be speculated that SARS-CoV-2 would further suppress IFN I

279

synthesis and delay host innate immunity as HGS increases. This hypothesis may explain the delayed immune

280

response and uncontrolled inflammatory response that lead to the epidemiological manifestations of SARS-

CoV-2, such as long incubation periods, mild symptoms, rapid spread and low mortality. However, the

282

mechanism of how viral proteins cause further delay of immune signaling and how it leads to new

283

immunopathological features remain largely unknown.

284

The discovery of increased HGS of ORF 6 and ORF 8 provides strong evidence that SARS-CoV-2 evolved

285

to be more adapted to humans than SARS-CoV. These inferences offer a valuable picture of how SARS-

286

CoV-2 could have become different from SARS-CoV. In addition, genetic mutations making the virus

287

genome adapted to humans can also be identified through HGS analysis.

288

The SARS-CoV-2 mutation 10818G>T is adapted to humans

289

Recent studies have shown that SARS-CoV-2 had a high mutation rate, and new mutations have emerged in

290

ORF1ab, S, ORF3a and ORF8[31, 32]. However, the types of mutations that contribute to viral adaptations

291

in humans are not clear. To understand how mutations aid survival of SARS-CoV-2 populations under

292

selective pressure, the accumulated nucleotide variants in consensus sequences were identified in 2594

293

genomes from China, the USA and Europe. The virus genome was identified by its HGS values of ten ORFs

294

(ORF1ab, S, ORF3a, E, M, ORF6, ORF7a, ORF7b, ORF8, and N). The percentages of virus strains with

295

unique ORF HGSs were 18% (36 out of 200), 9% (140 out of 1538) and 11% (98 out of 856) for genomes

296

with geolocations of China, the USA and Europe, respectively. A total of 74 mutations, 162 mutations and

297

145 mutations were identified in genomes for these three regions, respectively. Gene mutation profiles of

298

SARS-CoV-2 genomes with different HGSs are shown inFig 6, Fig 7 and Fig 8. SARS-CoV-2 in different

299

regions developed its own conserved mutations independently (Table 2). For example, the mutations in

genomes with a geolocation of China included the ORF1ab mutations 10818G>T (TTG>TTT), 1132G>A

Of all the gene mutations, the ORF1ab 10818G>T(TTG>TTT) mutation is the most interesting. This mutation

333

survived in all three regions (Fig 10). In addition, this mutation occurred only in the high HGS population

334

rather than in that with a lower HGS (Table 3). The SARS-CoV-2 ORF1ab gene encodes the precursor

335

polyprotein pp1ab, which is then cleaved into 16 nonstructural proteins (nsp1 to nsp16) by virus-encoded

336

proteinases. nsp6 plays a critical role in membrane anchoring of the RNA replication/transcription complex.

The expression of the nonstructural protein nsp6 along with nsp3 and nsp4 mediates the formation of double-

338

membrane vesicles (DMVs)[33], which are organelle-like structures for viral genome replication and protect

339

against host cell defenses.

Studies on the nsp6 protein showed that the protein is a transmembrane protein with 6 transmembrane

357

regions[34]. This 10818G>T ORF1ab mutation caused an amino acid mutation, M37F, in the nonstructural

358

protein nsp6, which is located in a loop between the first and second transmembrane domains on the N-

359

terminal side (Fig 11). This finding strongly suggested that the 10818G>T (M37F) mutation survived a

360

selection event and resulted in a new population of SARS-CoV-2 with high HGS, which could be more

361

adapted to humans. In addition, the simultaneous occurrence of ORF1ab 10818G>T in all three regions

362

demonstrated that the mutation was highly stable in human-adapted strains. Although mutations in the

363

nonstructural proteins nsp4 and nsp6 may affect the assembly of DMVs and viral autophagy, the underlying

364

basis of how the M37F mutation results in SARS-CoV-2 adaptation in humans is not clear.

369

The identification of conserved mutations demonstrates that SARS-CoV-2 can improve host adaptation. It is

370

reasonable to hypothesize that high HGS in SARS-CoV-2 genomes and conserved mutations may explain

371

the epidemiological characteristics of COVID-19, such as mild symptoms, rapid spread and low mortality.

However, the mechanism behind the impairment remains poorly understood and calls for future laboratory

Discussion

375

The HGS differences between SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV genomes are critical to understanding clinical

376

manifestations of the ongoing pandemic. ORF 6, 7b, 8 are the top 3 genes with significant HGS in SARS-

377

CoV-2. What’s more, ORF 6 and ORF 8 of the SARS-CoV-2 have clear increments in HGS, up to about

19

378

122% and 148% of that of SARS-CoV. Such apparent HGS changes suggest that these ORFs are important

379

in defining the difference between SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV. In the ongoing SARS-CoV-2 pandemic,

380

the number of infected people is growing much faster than SARS and the total number of diagnosed cases

381

exceeded that of SARS. But the mortality rate (about 3 %) was lower than SARS (about 11%)[35]. It is

382

known that the primary targets of SARS-CoV are lung and small intestine[36, 37]. Recent studies have found

383

that the SARS-CoV-2 may impair kidney function[38], infect the digestive system[39] and heart[40], and

384

cause liver damage[41]. Recent study showed that SARS-CoV-2 can cause thromboembolic

385

complications[42]. It has been reported that the SARS-CoV-2 virus can be found in stools and urine[40, 43].

386

In addition, an unusually long incubation period has been reported, during which more than half of the

387

patients had no signs of disease and the virus carriers may be highly contagious [43]. Why the COVID-19 is

388

so different from SARS is still not clear. But the mutations in virus genome and encoded proteins (such as

389

spike protein S) are believed as an important factor.

390

The knowledge on SARS-CoV-2 accessory proteins by now is quite limited. However, the viral genome and

391

proteins of SARS-CoV have been studied in depth in the past decade. Coronavirus has evolved to escape the

392

innate immune (especially IFN-I expression and signaling) through suppression of IFN induction and

393

singling pathways by non-structural proteins (nsps), structural proteins (S, E, M, N), and accessory proteins

394

(ORF 3a, 6, 7a, 7b, 8a, 8b) [20, 44-53]. By comparing the SARS-CoV gene HGS with that of SARS-CoV-2,

395

the obvious host-genome similarity changes shed light on the cause of rapid spread of COVID-19.

396

A power-law relationship is recognized between HGS and the expression of ISRE promoter, which is a direct

397

indicator of the virus to inhibit interferon synthesis. The HGS of ORF6 and ORF8 increase greatly in SARS-

398

CoV-2, which represents enhanced ability in suppressing innate immune. Although the functions of accessory

399

proteins of SARS-CoV-2 have not been well studied, the secondary structure prediction reveals that ORF 6

400

and 8 are transmembrane proteins and may have related functions as in SARS-CoV. In fact, the SARS-CoV-2

401

contains a full-length ORF 8, which in SARS-CoV this reading frame is divided into ORF 8a and ORF 8b.

402

Linking of ORF 8a and ORF 8b into a single continuous gene fragment had no significant effect on virus

403

growth and RNA replication in vitro[54], which indicates that there are ORFs of SARS-CoV-2 may be similar

404

to ORFs of SARS-CoV in function.

405

The discovery of increased HGS of ORF 6 and ORF 8 provide a strong evidence that SARS-COV-2 evolved

406

to be more adaptable to humans than SARS-CoV. Based on these findings, following conjecture is proposed

407

that the SARS-CoV-2 genes involved in suppressing the host's innate immunity are more powerful.

408

Therefore, SARS-CoV-2 causes the delayed response of host innate immunity, which results in rapid

409

transmission, low mortality and asymptomatic infection. These inferences are based on bioinformatics data,

410

but offer a valuable picture of how SARS-CoV-2 could become different from SARS-CoV. In addition, the

411

HGS method can also identify genetic mutations that help the virus adapt to humans.

412

It took the coronavirus 17 years to update from SARS-CoV to SARS-CoV-2. The significant increase in host-

413

genome similarity distinguishes SARS-COV-2 from SARS-COV. SARS-CoV-2 found out a way to improve

414

host adaptation. It is reasonable that high HGS may explain the quite different epidemiological characteristics

415

of SARS-CoV-2, such as mild symptoms, rapid spread and low mortality. But the mechanism behind the

416

impairment remains poorly understood and calls for future laboratory investigations. The COVID-19 appears

417

to be less able to cause deaths than SARS and MERS during the ongoing pandemic. However, there is still a

418

serious warning sign about viral mutation. The threat of another coronavirus outbreak with high

419

infectiousness and mortality remains an alarming possibility.

601

IFNAR senses type I IFN and leads to the JAK1-STAT signaling pathway, which expresses

602

antiviral proteins and bring neighboring cell into anti-virus state. The ORF6 suppresses type

603

I IFN expression by inhibiting translocation of STAT1+STAT2+IRF9 complex into nucleus.

604

ORF 6 also circumvent IFN production by inhibit IRF-3 phosphorylation in signaling

605

pathway (TRAF3)-(TBK1+IKK)-(IRF3)-(IFNβ). The expression of ORF8b and 8ab enhance

606

the IRF3 degradation, thus regulating immune functions of IRF3.

genome HGS values. Cells were cotransfected with the SARS-CoV proteins and either

609

infected with Sendai virus (S. virus) or treated with IFN after 24 hours. The expression of

610

the promoter decays rapidly with the increasing HGS of ORF 3b, ORF 6 and N, conforming

611

to a power law.
