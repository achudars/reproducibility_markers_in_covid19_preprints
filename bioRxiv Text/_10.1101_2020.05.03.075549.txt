Abstract
COVID-19, caused by SARS-CoV-2 infection, has already reached pandemic
proportions in a matter of a few weeks. At the time of writing this manuscript, the
unprecedented public health crisis caused more than 2.5 million cases with a mortality
range of 5-7%. The SARS-CoV-2, also called novel Coronavirus, is related to both
SARS-CoV and bat SARS. Great efforts have been spent to control the pandemic that
has become a significant burden on the health systems in a short time. Since the
emergence of the crisis, a great number of researchers started to use the AI tools to
identify drugs, diagnosing using CT scan images, scanning body temperature, and
classifying the severity of the disease. The emergence of variants of the SARS-CoV-2
genome is a challenging problem with expected serious consequences on the
management of the disease. Here, we introduce COVIDier, a deep learning-based
software that is enabled to classify the different genomes of Alpha coronavirus, Beta
coronavirus, MERS, SARS-CoV-1, SARS-CoV-2, and bronchitis-CoV. COVIDier
was trained on 1925 genomes, belonging to the three families of SARS retrieved from
NCBI Database to propose a new method to train deep learning model trained on
genome data using Multi-layer Perceptron Classifier (MLPClassifier), a deep learning
algorithm, that could blindly predict the virus family name from the genome of by
predicting the statistically similar genome from training data to the given genome.
COVIDier able to predict how close the emerging novel genomes of SARS to the
known genomes with accuracy 99%. COVIDier can replace tools like BLAST that
consume higher CPU and time.
1. Introduction
In December 2019, a pneumonia crisis in Wuhan, Hubei Province triggered by
an evolved coronavirus emerged and has spread quickly through China at on-going
pandemic risk (D. Wang et al. 2020)⁠. The pneumonia virus was initially named 2019
novel Coronavirus (2019-nCoV) after virus detection and isolation, which was
eventually officially referred to by the WHO as Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome
Coronavirus 2(SARS-CoV-2), (Zhou et al. 2020a)⁠. WHO announced a health
emergency of international significance on 30 January 2020 with the outbreak of
SARS-CoV-2. SARS-CoV-2 has greater transmitting capacity than the SARS-CoV
that contributed to an epidemic of SARS in 2003. The exponential growth in reported

cases is particularly severe in the detection and treatment in COVID-19. In
comparison to certain cases, COVID-19 clinical signs are characterized by respiratory
symptoms (Huang et al. 2020)⁠. Also, several people with cardiovascular disorders
(CVD) are at risk of death (Huang et al. 2020)⁠. Respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS)
is one of the main causes of respiratory failure and death due to COVID-19 infection
(Singhal 2020)⁠.
The coronavirus genome ranges between 26,000 and 32,000 bases in size.
including from 6 to 11 of open reading frames (ORFs) (Song et al. 2019)⁠. The SARS
coronaviruses possess four genes that encode the spike(S), the matrix(M), the
nucleocapsid (N), and the envelop(E) proteins (Figure 1A).

Figure 1: A. Coronavirus structure. B. Genome organization of coronaviruses
(subgenus Serbecovirus). The sequence length of each virus Spike (S) protein is
shownE=Envelope protein, M= membrane protein, N= Nucleocapsid protein, and S=
Spike protein.
The ‘S’ protein is a surface glycoprotein essential for the virus to bind
receptors on the host cell, thus determining host tropism (Zhu et al. 2018)⁠. Generally,
there is low heterogeneity in the genomes of SARS-CoV-2. A hypervariable genomic
hotspot is responsible for a Serine/Leucine variation in the viral ORF8‐encoded
protein (Ceraolo and Giorgi 2020)⁠. In the coronavirus genomic analysis, the S gene of
SARS-CoV-2 has low sequence identity with other Betacoronaviruses (Figure 1B).
The ‘S’ protein in SARS-CoV-2 is longer than SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV. Most

importantly are the difference in the receptor-binding domain between the new
SARS-CoV-2 and the other two viruses (Zhou et al. 2020b)⁠. Different receptors on
the host cells are involved in the entry of different viruses, e.g. CD26 fro MERS-CoV
and ACE2 for SARS-CoV (Lu et al. 2020)⁠. Although several identical residues to
that of SARS-CoVs was identified in the SARS-CoV-2, however, they show
phylogenic divergence (Letko et al., 2020)⁠.
AI and deep learning tools stated to be important for the evaluation and
decision-making of patients (Neill 2013)⁠. Studies have been conducted to facilitate the
diagnosis of disease using AI models (Rajalakshmi et al. 2018; Arabasadi et al. 2017;
Kumar et al., 2016; Tomlinson et al. 2009). In the health data collection, the use of
smartphones (Ballivian et al. 2015; Braun et al. 2013; Bastawrous and Armstrong
2013; Paolotti et al. 2014) and web-based portals (Fabic et al., 2012)⁠ (Metsky et al.
2020)⁠ were efficiently examined. These methods will, however, be used in a great
time to produce better performance. In addition to the cost-efficiency, the new
simulation would help to classify and monitor communities closed to the spreading of
the virus. We can also conveniently expand our proposed algorithm to recognize
people with moderate symptoms and signs
AI has been reported to be one of the most powerful technologies against the
new pandemic. Currently, attempts to create new diagnostic methods using machine
learning algorithms have been started. In machine learning, for example, high
sensitivity and speed were verified with the SARS-CoV-2 research designs utilizing
CRISPR-based viral detection systems (Y. Wang et al. 2020)⁠ . For screening of
COVID-19 patients based on their various breathing patterns, neural network
recognition models were developed (Gozes et al. 2020)⁠. Likewise, a deep-learning
analysis network of the chest CT images was constructed for automatic identification
and tracking of COVID-19 patients over time (DeCaprio et al. 2020)⁠. Machine
learning has been used by DeCapprio et al. to create an initial COVID-19
Vulnerability Index (DeCaprio et al. 2020)⁠. The mortality likelihood of a patient
developing ARDS is predicted by interrogating the initial symptoms (Munsell et al.
2015)⁠ .
Machine-learning has previously been used to predict treatment outcomes in
various diseases and disorders; for patients with epilepsy (Trebeschi et al. 2019)⁠ ,
responses to cancer immunotherapy (Schork 2019)⁠. Machine learning now has been
used to predict COVID-19 treatment outcomes (Broecker and Moelling 2019)⁠.Viruses
help human immune systems evolve over long decades. An image emerges from and
is transported by viruses and transposable elements into the various cellular immune
systems. Immune systems have possibly evolved from simple exclusion from
superinfection to very complex defense strategies (CDCP 2017)⁠. However, the
concept of 'viral genome - host Genome interaction' continues to be the trend after
reporting many cellular infection processes are mediated by the virus and the host
through a network of genes. The interaction? between genome and genome naturally
influences the immune response as well as the drug response. For instance, infection
with some influenza A virus subtypes such as H5N1 and H7N9 may cause severe
respiratory disease (Berhane et al. 2016; Josset et al. 2014). Previous studies showed
that weaker innate immune responses were induced by H5N1 and H7N9 (Samy et al.
2016; Suzuki et al. 2009) . At the drug response stage, drug sensitivity testing
demonstrated that the new isolates were oseltamivir-resistant but peramivir-sensitive
(Gao et al. 2014)⁠.
Classifying the genomes according to their immune and drug response will
become increasingly important for future personalization of the diagnosis and

treatment by viral genome sort. Here we introduce COVIDier, a deep learning tool to
classify SARS subtypes genomes to the main families: Alpha coronavirus, Beta
coronavirus, MERS, SARS-CoV-1, SARS-CoV-2, and bronchitis-CoV. COVIDier is
a user-friendly and open-source software that can be modified and integrated into
different frameworks.
2. Implementation
COVIDier is written in Python, one of the most used programming languages
in the bioinformatics that is easy to learn, powerful, and has tremendous useful
libraries including Biopython, Pandas and ETE3. COVIDier was implemented as a
Python tool with open source code to be modified and integrated into a different
frame.
2.1. Data Collection
Training and testing data sets include a 1925 genome of Alpha coronavirus,
Beta coronavirus, MERS, SARS-CoV-1, SARS-CoV-2, and bronchitis-CoV and 7702
protein of spike protein, envelope protein, nucleocapsid phosphoprotein, membrane
glycoprotein, a surface glycoprotein from the previously mentioned genomes.
distributed data for different coronaviridae were collected from the NCBI. The
causative agents of SARS and COVID-19, and the associated family that causes bat
SARS, are especially of interest. A CSV file of genomic sequence with NCBI
accession number contains the data unique to those three classes.
2.2. Data pre-processing
We used the CounterVectorizer function to convert a set of text to a token
count matrix, as our data was expressed in text form. We used CounterVectorizer to
convert textual data to numeric in genome sequence to allow the algorithm to learn
and improve our deep learning model's predictive potential. To vectorize the data, we
deploy the training file as control or/and normal.
from sklearn.feature_extraction.text import CountVectorizer
2.3. Algorithm Selection
We used the selection code from the TarDict algorithm to find the most
suitable algorithm on the genome data (Habib et al. 2020)⁠. By looping 23 algorithms.
Testing and evaluation showed that MLPClassifier is the best 99.6% accuracy.

2.4. Multi-layer Perceptron Classifier (MLPClassifier)
MLPClassifier can be presented as generalizations of linear models executing

multiple processing stages to arrive at a decision. Linear regression defined as:
ŷ = w[0] * x[0] + w[1] * x[1] + ... + w[p] * x[p] + b
Where ŷ is the sum of the input features (x[0]) to (x[p]), weighted by the learned
coefficients (w[0]) to (w[p]). MLPClassifier trains using Back-propagation introduced
by Rumelhart et., al in 1989. The algorithm is used to effectively train a neural
network through a method called chain rule. While training, after each forward pass
through a network, backpropagation performs a backward pass while adjusting the
model’s parameters (weights and biases).
The 8-layer neural network consists of 1925 neurons for input layer, 6 hidden
layers each with 150,250,260,250,180,70 neurons respectively, and 1neuron of output
layer for the input layer, 4 neurons for the hidden layers and 1 neuron for the output
layer as shown in Figure 2.
For each forward pass, the final step is to compare the estimated output x
against the predicted output y. The output y is part of the training dataset (x, y) where
x is the origin. Evaluation between x and y occurs by a cost function. This can be as
basic as mean squared error (MSE) or more complex as cross-entropy. The model was
designed to know how much to change its parameters to get closer to the expected
output y, based on cost-function meaning. This happens using the Backpropagation
algorithm.
Backpropagation aims to reduce the cost function by adjusting the network's
weights and biases. The degree of adjustment is determined by the cost function
concerning certain parameters. Firstly, The algorithm select values of w and b are
random, the initial learning rate of Epsilon (e) which is 0.001 in our model defines the
effect of the gradient. The weight or bias derivative of the cost function can be
determined using partial cost function derivatives in the individual weights or biases.
Learning terminates until the cost function is reduced.
2.5. Functions
COVIDier consisting of 5 modules to receive user input whether in FASTA
format or list of accession numbers, predict the family of the genome, perform
multiple sequence alignment, and visualize the alignment.
from Scripts.DownloadSeq import Download, DownloadProtein
from Scripts.fromcsvtofasta import Pre_Process
from Scripts.COVID_predict import COVIDier_Predict
from Scripts.COVID_predict_Proteins import COVIDier_Predict_Protein
from Alignment.Clustal import Clustal
from Scripts.visualization import PhyloVisualize
Download() for nucleotide and DownloadProtein() for protein are functions
imported from the Biopython library to download the record of given IDs in the list.
Pre_Process() is a regex-based function to extract IDs and sequences from the FASTA
file to prepare it in the proper format of prediction. COVIDier_Predict() function that
reads the given nucleotide genomes, vectorizes, and predicts the family of the genome
and COVID_Predict_Protein() do the same but for protein. Clustal() is a part from the
Biopython library for multiple sequence alignment used in COVIDier to show the
differences between the input genomes. PhyloVisualize() uses the ETE3 python
package to display the multiple sequence alignment produced by Clustal().

3. Results and Discussion
The COVIDier is a deep learning tool that uses Sci-kit learn packages
(Pedregosa et al. 2011)⁠ to classify between Alpha coronavirus, Beta coronavirus,
MERS, SARS-CoV-1, SARS-CoV-2, and bronchitis-CoV genomes with accuracy
99.6% and visualize the differences between input genomes by browsing the multiple
sequence alignment. Moreover, COVIDier provides users with genome length and
count each nucleotide content in the genome. It consists of 8 layers, 1 for input, 1 for
output, and 6 hidden layers as shown in Figure 2.

over 100 to be represent-able).
3.1. Confusion Matrix and Classification Report
In the field of machine learning, and in particular the problem of statistical
classification, a confusion matrix, also known as an error matrix, is a description of
predictive effects on a classification problem. The number of observations that are
accurate and inaccurate is listed with count values and broken down by class. The
confusion matrix reveals how the classification model becomes confused when
making predictions. This provides insight not only into the errors produced by a
classifier but also, more critically, into the types of errors produced. The accuracy of
predictions from a classification algorithm is evaluated using a Classification Report.
How many are True Predictions and how many are Wrong. True Positives, False
Positives, True negatives, and False Negatives are used to estimate a classification
report's metrics as shown in Tables 1 and 2.

3.2. COVIDier and BLAST
A well-known tool that widely used for alignment and classification of
genomes is BLAST (Altschul et al. 1990)⁠. We used the 450 of training genomes to
test the performance of COVIDier and BLAST. The results show that COVIDier has
much higher performance and speed where it was able to classify 450 genomes in 18
seconds, while BLAST continues the alignment for 5 minutes and collapsed. Such
results may raise the importance of using such an approach instead of BLAST for
genomic classification on a large scale.

4. State-of-The-Art
From the beginning of COVID-19, authorities over the world spent their efforts on
fighting the virus, or at least slow its spreading. Researchers are called to accelerate
the pace of their efforts using AI to stop the pandemic. COVIDier deploying deep
learning able to classify different genomes of SARS in fast and accurate manner
focusing the light on the importance of AI in such processes the require high

computation power and the need to replace the traditional tools with artificially
intelligent tools to maximize the accuracy and minimize the required time and
processing power. Detecting the variants in the virus genome with high accuracy may
lead to better population-based vaccine designing (according to the geographical
location), and hopefully to better prevention of the disease.
5. Conclusion
There has been a sparkling spread of the atypical viral pneumonia caused by
the zoonotic coronavirus SARS-CoV-2. The pandemic is unprecedented for health
care systems worldwide. Detection of the specific genome sequence of the virus is
highly important. A deep learning model was trained on genome data using Multilayer Perceptron Classifier (MLPClassifier), a deep learning algorithm, that could
blindly predict the virus family name from the genome through statistically similar
genome from training data to the given genome. Accordingly, we designed
“COVIDier”, a CPU- and time-saving tool, to predict variability in coronavirus
genome with high accuracy. In this paper, we used 1925 genomes belong to the three
families of SARS retrieved from NCBI Database to propose a new method to train
deep learning model trained on genome data using Multi-layer Perceptron Classifier
(MLPClassifier), a deep learning algorithm, that could blindly predict the virus family
name from the genome of by predicting the statistically similar genome from training
data to the given genome. A tool such as COVIDier predicted to replace tools like
BLAST that consume higher CPU and time.
