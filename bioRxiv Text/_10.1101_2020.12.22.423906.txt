Abstract

22

SARS-CoV-2 is a newly emerged coronavirus (CoV) that spread through human populations

23

worldwide in early 2020. CoVs rely on host cell proteases for activation and infection. The trypsin-

24

like protease TMPRSS2 at the cell surface, cathepsin L in endolysosomes, and furin in the Golgi

25

have all been implicated in the SARS-CoV-2 proteolytic processing. Whether SARS-CoV-2

26

depends on endocytosis internalization and vacuolar acidification for infectious entry remains

27

unclear. Here, we examined the dynamics of SARS-CoV-2 activation during the cell entry process

28

in tissue culture. Using four cell lines representative of lung, colon, and kidney epithelial tissues,

29

we found that TMPRSS2 determines the SARS-CoV-2 entry pathways. In TMPRSS2-positive

30

cells, infection was sensitive to aprotinin, a TMPRSS2 inhibitor, but not to SB412515, a drug that

31

impairs cathepsin L. Infectious penetration was marginally dependent on endosomal acidification,

32

and the virus passed the protease-sensitive step within 10 min. In a marked contrast, in

33

TMPRSS2-negative cells cathepsin L and low pH were required for SARS-CoV-2 entry. The

34

cathepsin L-activated penetration occurred within 40-60 min after internalization and required

35

intact endolysosomal functions. Importantly, pre-activation of the virus allowed it to bypass the

36

need for endosomal acidification for viral fusion and productive entry. Overall, our results indicate

37

that SARS-CoV-2 shares with other CoVs a strategy of differential use of host cell proteases for

38

activation and infectious penetration. This study also highlights the importance of TMPRSS2 in

39

dictating the entry pathway used by SARS-CoV-2.

40

Significance

41

Preventing SARS-CoV-2 spread requires approaches affecting early virus-host cell interactions

42

before the virus enters and infects target cells. Host cell proteases are critical for coronavirus

43

activation and infectious entry. Here, we reconcile apparent contradictory observations from

44

recent reports on endosomal acidification and the role of furin, TMPRSS2, and cathepsin L in the

45

productive entry and fusion process of SARS-CoV-2. Investigating authentic virus in various cell

types, we demonstrated that SARS-CoV-2 developed the ability to use different entry pathways,

47

depending on the proteases expressed by the target cell. Our results have strong implications for

48

future research on the apparent broad tropism of the virus in vivo. This study also provides a

49

handle to develop novel antiviral strategies aiming to block virus entry, as illustrated with the

50

several drugs that we identified to prevent SARS-CoV-2 infection, some with low IC50.

Introduction

52

The Coronaviridae is a large viral family of several hundred members, which constitutes along

53

with Arteriviridae and Roniviridae the order Nidovirales (1). To date, four coronaviruses (CoVs)

54

have been identified as the leading cause for common colds in humans (2). Three other CoVs,

55

causing severe respiratory diseases, have emerged into the human population as a result of

56

spillover events from wildlife during the last two decades (3). Severe acute respiratory syndrome

57

(SARS)-CoV and Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS)-CoV were first isolated in China in

58

2002 and Saudi Arabia in 2011, respectively (3). The most recent, SARS-CoV-2, is responsible

59

for CoV induced disease (COVID-19) and turned into a pandemic in early 2020. As of December

60

22, 2020, more than 77 million human cases have been reported with at least 1.7 million deaths.

61

As other CoVs, SARS-CoV-2 particles are enveloped, roughly spherical, with a diameter

62

between 90 and 110 nm (4, 5). The viral genome consists of one single-stranded positive-sense

63

RNA segment that replicates in the cytosol and encodes four structural proteins. Three

64

transmembrane proteins are embedded in the viral envelope and are exposed at the virion

65

surface, namely the large glycoprotein S, the membrane protein M, and the envelope protein E

66

(3). The nucleoprotein NP binds to the genomic RNA to form nucleocapsid structures inside the

67

viral particles. In the viral envelope, glycoprotein S forms spike-like projections up to 35 nm in

68

length, responsible for virus attachment to host cells and penetration by membrane fusion (6).

69

Although SARS-CoV-2 has been the subject of intense research since the beginning of

70

2020, our current understanding of cell entry remains essentially derived from studies on SARS-

71

CoV and other CoVs (3). SARS-CoV-2 has been shown to rely on ACE2 (7), heparan sulfates (8),

72

and neuropilin-1 (9) at the cell surface for infection. Inhibitor studies support the possibility that the

73

virus enters the endosomal vesicles and relies on vacuolar acidification for the infectious entry

74

process (7, 10, 11). As with many other CoVs, there is intense debate as to whether SARS-CoV-

75

2 enters the host cells from the plasma membrane or from intracellular compartments.

76

To gain access into the cytosol, enveloped viruses must fuse their envelope with the cell

77

membrane. Several classes of viral fusion proteins are known to mediate this process, each with

78

their own molecular specificities [reviewed in (12)]. Structural studies categorized the SARS-CoV-

79

2 protein S as a Class-I viral fusion protein, within the same group as other corona-, human

80

immunodeficiency, and influenza (IAV) viruses (13-15). Cryo-electron microscopy showed that the

81

S protein forms homotrimers at the surface of SARS-CoV-2 particles, in which the viral fusion

82

subunits are buried (13, 14). The activation of the Class-I viral fusion proteins usually involves

83

proteolytic processing, and membrane fusion is triggered by interactions with cell receptors and

84

sometimes endosomal acidification. Activation and priming are irreversible steps, and the Class-I

85

viral fusion proteins act only once (12). In the case of SARS-CoV-2, endosomal acidification

86

appears to be non-essential to induce the spike-mediated fusion of the host membrane with the

87

viral envelope (16). Yet why SARS-CoV-2 infection is sensitive to perturbants of endosomal

88

acidification remains unclear.

89

Several proteases have been proposed to prime and activate the S protein (17), a step prior

90

virus fusion and infection. Furin is a calcium-dependent serine endoprotease widely expressed in

91

tissues. It has been proposed to cleave the S protein at the site S1/S2 (17-19), most likely when

92

the viral progeny exits the infected cells. The cleavage results in two subunits, S1 and S2. S1

93

contains a receptor binding domain, and S2 the membrane fusion effector. An additional

94

proteolytic cleavage in the S2 subunit occurs at the site S2’ during virus entry to trigger the fusion

95

of the viral envelope with the host cell membrane. The transmembrane serine protease 2

96

(TMPRSS2), a cell surface trypsin-like protease (20), and cathepsin L, an endolysosomal cysteine

97

protease (21), have both been proposed to be involved in the cleavage at the S2’ site (5, 7, 17,

98

22, 23). Still, the timing and dynamics of proteolytic cleavages and their potential role in SARS-

99

CoV-2 activation, fusion, and entry remain unclear.

100

SARS-CoV-2 primarily targets cells of the lung epithelium but is also found in many other

101

epithelial tissues as it spreads throughout the host. The fact that epithelia express ACE2,

TMPRSS2, and cathepsin L most likely differentially influences the cell entry mechanisms of

103

SARS-CoV-2 in a specific manner. In the present study, we developed sensitive, quantitative

104

assays to analyze the SARS-CoV-2 entry process in different epithelial cell types. Using these

105

assays, we determined SARS-CoV-2 dependence on low pH, proteolytic processing, proteases-

106

and endosomal acidification-requiring dynamics, endocytosis, and protease-activated membrane

107

fusion. Our work established that SARS-CoV-2 shares with MERS-CoV and other CoVs the ability

108

to make a differential use of host cell proteases to enter and infect target cells.

Characterization of SARS-CoV-2 Life Cycle in Caco-2 and Vero Cells

111

Many epithelial cell types have been reported to support productive SARS-CoV-2 infection (7),

112

and both the TMPRSS2 and cathepsin L proteases have been implicated in the proteolytic

113

processing of the viral S protein (5, 7, 17, 22, 23). We selected four epithelial cell lines that are

114

known to support SARS-CoV-2 infection, i.e., Calu-3, Caco-2, A549, and Vero cells (7). A549 are

115

intrinsically poorly infectable by SARS-CoV-2 due to the absence of the SARS-CoV-2 receptor

116

ACE2 (7). As such, we used A549 cells stably overexpressing ACE2 (A549*). When cell lysates

117

were subjected to SDS-PAGE and western blotting, we found that TMPRSS2 was effectively

118

expressed in Calu-3 cells and to a lower extent in Caco-2 cells (Fig. 1A), corroborating results

119

from others (24). Regardless of the presence of TMPRSS2, cathepsin L (from 25 to 31 kDa) and

120

its inactive form, i.e., procathepsin L (35 to 41 kDa), were present in all the cell lines (Fig. 1B).

121

However, the conversion of procathepsin L to cathepsin L appeared significantly higher in Vero

122

cells than in the three other cell lines.

123

To address how the presence or absence of TMPRSS2 influences the SARS-CoV-2

124

infectious penetration, and how the endosomal acidification contributes to the process, we aimed

125

to compare cell lines expressing or not this protease. To this end, we first defined the timing for a

126

single round of infection using our cell lines. Calu-3 and Caco-2 served as TMPRSS2-positive

127

(TMPRSS2+) cells, and A549* and Vero as non-expressing cells. The susceptibility of Caco-2 and

128

Vero cells to SARS-CoV-2 at multiplicities of infection (MOIs) of 0.1 and 0.5, respectively, was

129

assessed by ﬂuorescence microscopy after immunostaining with a mouse monoclonal antibody

130

(mAb) against the intracellular viral nucleoprotein NP (Fig. 1C). Results show that 10% of Caco-2

131

cells were positive for NP at 8 hours post-infection (hpi). Similarly, 35% of Vero cells were found

132

infected at 8 hpi (Fig. 1C).

133

To quantify infection more accurately, we then performed flow cytometry analysis of Caco-

134

2 and Vero cells infected with different MOIs of SARS-CoV-2 (Fig. 1D and E). The fluorescence

135

increased over time and reached a plateau within 16 to 24 hpi (Fig. 1E), showing that the signal

136

detected in the flow cytometry-based assays corresponded to viral replication and not to input

137

particles. These kinetics were in agreement with real-time quantitative reverse transcription PCR

138

(qRT-PCR) monitoring over time the amount of SARS-CoV-2 genome (Fig. 1F).

139

To evaluate the production and release of de novo infectious viral particles, we infected

140

Caco-2 and Vero cells and quantified virus production up to 24 hpi by 50% tissue culture infective

141

dose assay (TCID50). Infectious progeny viruses were found to be released from infected cells as

142

early as 8-12 hpi (Fig. 1G). Virus replication kinetics and de novo virus release was found to be

143

similar in Calu-3 and A549* cells (data not shown). Altogether, our analysis revealed that SARS-

144

CoV-2 completes one round of infection, from virus binding and entry to replication and release of

145

de novo infectious particles, within 8 h in Caco-2 cells and somewhat longer in Vero cells, i.e.,

146

between 8 and 12 h. In all the further experiments, as we aimed at characterizing SARS-CoV-2

147

entry mechanisms therefore we used MOIs allowing the infection of about 20% of the cells and

148

limited our assays to 8 hpi.

149

SARS-CoV-2 Makes a Differential Use of Host Cell Proteases for Infectious Penetration

150

To evaluate the role of the cell surface TMPRSS2 and endolysosomal cathepsin L proteases in

151

the entry mechanisms of SARS-CoV-2, we used aprotinin and SB412515, respectively, to

152

selectively inhibit the two proteases. As expected, no noticeable effect was observed when

153

aprotinin was added to TMPRSS2-negative (TMPRSS2-) cells (A549* and Vero cells) prior to

154

infection (Fig. 2A). In agreement with previous work (25), we observed that aprotinin reduced

155

SARS-CoV-2 infection in a dose-dependent manner in the cells that express TMPRSS2 (Calu-3

156

and Caco-2 cells) (Fig. 2A). Conversely, SB412515 effectively prevented the infection of cells

157

lacking TMPRSS2 (Vero and A549* cells) in a dose-dependent manner but had no effect on

158

SARS-CoV-2 infection of Calu-3 and Caco-2 cells (Fig. 2B). The fact that aprotinin interfered with

159

SARS-CoV-2 infection in Calu-3 and Caco-2 cells indicated that, even if TMPRSS2 was blocked,

160

cathepsin L would not take over and subsequently process SARS-CoV-2.

161

We next determined the kinetics of the cathepsin L- and TMPRSS2-dependent SARS-CoV-

162

2 entry process. Cells were incubated with viruses at a low MOI (~0.9) on ice and rapidly shifted

163

to 37°C to allow virus entry and protease activity. The cathepsin L and TMPRSS2 inhibitors were

164

added at different times after warming to prevent further activation and penetration of the virus. In

165

other words, we determined the time when inhibition of SARS-CoV-2 activation is no longer

166

possible, which resulted in an increase of infection. In both TMPRSS2- cell lines (A549* and Vero

167

cells), the SB412515 add-in time course revealed that the activation by cathepsin L and the

168

subsequent infectious penetration of SARS-CoV-2 started after a 15 min lag and reached a half

169

maximal level (t1/2) within 40-60 min (Fig. 2C). Evidently, exposure of individual viruses to

170

cathepsin L occurred non-synchronously during a time span 15-90 min after warming. The add-in

171

time course using aprotinin showed that productive penetration was much faster in TMPRSS2+

172

cells (Calu-3 and Caco-2 cells) (Fig. 2D). The t1/2 of activation by TMPRSS2 was reached within

173

5-10 min in both cell lines. Taken together, our observations demonstrated that TMPRSS2 allowed

174

for a faster activation and penetration of SARS-CoV-2 in comparison to cells for which infection

175

depends on cathepsin L.

176

TMPRSS2 Governs SARS-CoV-2 Dependence on Low pH for Infectious Entry

177

Recent reports indicated that SARS-CoV-2 infection is sensitive to lysosomotropic weak bases

178

that neutralize vacuolar pH such as ammonium chloride (NH 4Cl) and chloroquine (7, 10, 11).

179

However, TMPRSS2 is active at the cell surface under neutral pH conditions (20), unlike cathepsin

180

L, which requires the low-pH environment typical of endolysosomes (21). To assess the

181

importance of endosomal acidification for infectious entry in cells expressing (Caco-2 and Calu-3)

182

and lacking (A549* and Vero) TMPRSS2, cells were exposed to SARS-CoV-2 in the presence of

183

increasing amounts of NH4Cl or chloroquine. Our results showed that both weak bases induced a

9

184

dose-dependent inhibition of infection regardless of the cell type and of TMPRSS2 expression

185

(Fig. 3A and 3B). However, the dose to inhibit 50% of SARS-CoV-2 infection (IC50) was found to

186

be significantly lower in cells devoid of TMPRSS2 compared to cells expressing the protease,

187

reaching a 200-fold difference for chloroquine (Table 1).

188

To validate the observation that TMPRSS2+ cells were less dependent on endosomal

189

acidification for SARS-CoV-2 infection, we made used of Bafilomycin A1 and Concanamycin B,

190

which are inhibitors of the vacuolar-type proton-ATPases (vATPases). Incubation of cells with

191

increasing amounts of the two drugs resulted in a dose-dependent inhibition of SARS-CoV-2

192

infection (Fig. 3C and 3D). Importantly, the inhibition was marginal with 10 nM of Bafilomycin A1

193

and Concanamycin B in TMPRSS2+ cells (Caco-2 and Calu-3), and the decrease in infection did

194

not exceed 50-80% at 50 nM of Concanamycin B. For comparison, infection with Uukuniemi virus

195

(UUKV), a late-penetrating virus that relies on low pH in late endosomes (LE) for penetration (26),

196

is strongly inhibited in the presence of 2 to 10 nM of Concanamycin B or Bafilomycin A1 (26).

197

From these results, it was evident that, similar to the lysosomotropic weak bases, SARS-CoV-2

198

infection appeared to be significantly less sensitive to vATPase inhibitors in TMPRSS2+ cells

199

(Caco-2 and Calu-3) in comparison to cells lacking the protease (Vero and A549* cells) (Table 1).

200

SARS-CoV-2 Can Use Two Distinct Routes to Enter and Infect Target Cells

201

Our results suggested that SARS-CoV-2 infection relied more on endosomal acidification in cells

202

devoid of TMPRSS2 than cells expressing the protease. To pursue this possibility, we determined

203

the kinetics of the acidification step required for the infectious penetration of SARS-CoV-2 into

204

TMPRSS2- cells. We took advantage of the fact that the neutralization of endosomal pH is nearly

205

instantaneous upon NH4Cl addition to the extracellular medium (27). Virus particles were first

206

allowed to attach to A549* and Vero cells on ice. Entry was then synchronized by switching cells

207

rapidly to 37°C, and NH4Cl was added at different times. In A549* and Vero cells, viruses passed

208

the NH4Cl-sensitive step 15 min after cell warming, and the t1/2 was reached within 50 min (Fig.

10

209

3E). Overall, the kinetics of SARS-CoV-2 acid-activated penetration closely resembled the time

210

course of cathepsin L-dependent activation in the absence of TMPRSS2 (Fig. 2C).

211

In Calu-3 and Caco-2 cells, both of which express TMPRSS2, it was not possible to

212

determine the timing of the acid-requiring step. We failed to detect SARS-CoV-2-infected cells

213

even by adding NH4Cl several hours after transferring the cells from 4 to 37°C (Fig. 3E). In samples

214

where NH4Cl was omitted, infection was readily detectable with 17% of Calu-3 and Caco-2 cells

215

infected (data not shown) suggesting that the weak base interferes with SARS-CoV-2 replication

216

in these two cell lines. It is highly likely that NH4Cl disrupts TMPRSS2+ cell-specific functions that

217

are important for SARS-CoV-2 replication. NH4Cl not only neutralizes the intracellular pH but also

218

alters all endosomal, lysosomal, and trans-Golgi-network functions that are acid dependent (28).

219

As an alternative method to alter endosomal pH, we used Concanamycin B instead of NH4Cl

220

and added the vATPase inhibitor to Caco-2-cell-bound virus at different times after warming. The

221

time course showed that SARS-CoV-2 infection was insensitive to the Concanamycin B add-in as

222

early as a few seconds after shifting Caco-2 cells to 37°C (Fig. 3F). In a marked contrast, infectious

223

entry of UUKV started after 15 min and had not reached a maximum 2 h after cell warming. As

224

expected, SARS-CoV-2 passed the Concanamycin B-sensitive step in Vero cells within less than

225

15 min, and infectious entry reached a plateau value after 45 min, somewhat faster than in using

226

NH4Cl (Fig. 3E). This difference in Vero sensitivity to endosomal pH may be that Concanamycin

227

B not only interferes with endosomal functions that are acid dependent but also indirectly with the

228

maturation of endosomes. However, unlike NH4Cl, it was apparent that Concanamycin B had no

229

adverse effect on SARS-CoV-2 replication in all these experiments. Taken together, these results

230

strongly suggested that SARS-CoV-2 can use two different routes to enter and infect target cells,

231

i.e., fast pH-independent penetration in TMPRSS2+ cells (Fig. 2D and 3F) and slow acid-activated

232

entry in cells lacking TMPRSS2 (Fig. 2C and 3E).

SARS-CoV-2 Relies on Endolysosomal Maturation for Infection of TMPRSS2- Cells

234

The timing of acid-dependent and protease-activated steps suggested that SARS-CoV-2

235

penetration might occur from endolysosomes in cells devoid of TMPRSS2 and from the plasma

236

membrane or early endosomes (EEs) in TMPRSS2+ cells. To determine whether SARS-CoV-2

237

requires reaching the endolysosomal compartments for the productive infection of TMPRSS2-

238

cells, we exploited the small GTPase Rab7a, which is a key player of LE maturation and function.

239

TMPRSS2- Vero cells were transfected with DNA plasmids encoding the wild-type (wt), the

240

dominant-negative (Rab7a T22N), and the constitutively active (Rab7a Q67L) forms of Rab7a

241

tagged with the enhanced green fluorescent protein (EGFP) prior to infection with SARS-CoV-2.

242

Transfected cells were selected for different levels of EGFP expression and then analyzed for

243

infection. Increasing expression of the wt molecule of Rab7a facilitated SARS-CoV-2 infection. On

244

the contrary, increasing expression of both mutants of Rab7a, which abrogates the maturation of

245

newly formed LEs (26, 29), resulted in a 50% decrease in infection (Fig. 4A), indicating that the

246

virus cannot fuse in Rab7a T22N- and Q67L-late endosomal vesicles. This result suggested that

247

proper maturation of LEs is mandatory for the cathepsin L-dependent infectious entry of SARS-

248

CoV-2.

249

LE maturation relies on microtubule-mediated transport to the nuclear periphery and

250

proteasome activity (26, 29). Treatment of Vero cells with colcemid, a drug that interferes with

251

microtubule polymerization, resulted in a 30%-45% decrease in infection (Fig. 4B). Additionally,

252

late endosomal penetration of IAV and UUKV has been shown to be sensitive to free ubiquitin

253

depletion produced by the proteasome inhibitor MG-132 (26, 30). Therefore, to determine if free

254

ubiquitin was required for SARS-CoV-2 infection, A549* and Vero cells were treated with MG-132.

255

Results show that SARS-CoV-2 infection was strongly inhibited in the presence of MG-132 in both

256

cell lines (Fig. 4C). The calculated IC50 confirmed the high proficiency (4 to 17 nM) of MG-132 to

257

interfere with the cathepsin L-mediated SARS-CoV-2 entry route (Table 1).

258

To determine the kinetic of the MG-132-sensitive step in the entry process, we followed the

259

same experimental procedure used to determine the kinetics of endosomal acidification-

260

dependent and cathepsin L-mediated activation of SARS-CoV-2 (Fig. 2C and 3E) but utilizing MG-

261

132 instead of protease inhibitor and NH 4Cl. Briefly, viruses were bound to A549* and Vero cells

262

at a low MOI on ice, and then promptly switched to 37°C before adding MG-132 at different times.

263

After a 15 min lag, infectious penetration occurred asynchronously between 30 and 60 min, with

264

a t1/2 within 40-50 min (Fig. 4D). This time course was consistent with endolysosomal maturation,

265

which usually lasts 30-60 min (31). Altogether, these results show that the cathepsin L-dependent

266

SARS-CoV-2 infection depends on endolysosome maturation in TMPRSS2- A549* and Vero cells.

267

Interestingly, LE maturation was also required in TMPRSS2+ cells (Calu-3 and Caco-2 cells)

268

as SARS-CoV-2 infection was reduced by colcemid in a dose-dependent manner in both cell lines

269

(Fig. 4E). Though the inhibition was efficient, the IC50 values of MG-132 were one to three logs

270

higher in TMPRSS2+ cells compared to TMPRSS2- cells (Fig. 4F). As shown in Fig. 4G, infection

271

of Calu-3 and Caco-2 cells was not readily detectable when MG-132 was added 2 hpi. Together,

272

the data suggest that MG-132 impaired viral replication in these assays and not the TMPRSS2-

273

dependent SARS-CoV-2 entry process.

274

Low pH Is Not Essential for SARS-CoV-2 Membrane Fusion

275

The penetration of enveloped viruses into the cytosol involves fusion between the viral envelope

276

and a cell membrane. In most cases, endosomal acidification contributes to activate viral

277

glycoproteins and is used as a cue to trigger fusion (12). SARS-CoV-2 does not rely on endosomal

278

acidification to enter TMPRSS2+ cells, which suggests that the virus does not rely on low pH for

279

membrane fusion but solely for the activation of cathepsin L in cells lacking TMPRSS2.

280

To examine the requirement of pH acidification for the SARS-CoV-2 membrane fusion

281

mechanisms, we first assessed the possibility to inactivate the virus with acidic buffers prior

282

infection. In such an assay, the virus undergoes a transition toward the post-fusion state at the

13

bioRxiv preprint doi: https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.12.22.423906; this version posted December 23, 2020. The copyright holder for this preprint

283

optimal pH. If the transition is irreversible, the spike protein is no longer able to fuse with target-

284

cell membranes, and thus, the viral particles are rendered non-infectious. With this approach, we

285

found that about 50% of viruses were still infectious in Caco-2 and Vero cells, even after an

286

exposition to buffers at pH ~5 for 10 min (Fig. 5A). Semliki forest virus (SFV) is an early-penetrating

287

virus that has a Class-II viral fusion glycoprotein with an irreversible priming step triggered at a

288

pH-activation threshold of 6.2 (26). In contrast to SARS-CoV-2, infection by low pH-pretreated

289

SFV was reduced by 70-80% at pH ~6.0 and below (Fig. 5B).

290

To further investigate the influence of low pH on SARS-CoV-2 fusion, we then evaluated the

291

capacity of SARS-CoV-2 to mediate cell-cell fusion (‘‘fusion-from-within’’) as described for

292

unrelated viruses (32). To this end, we used Vero cells as they are negative for TMPRSS2, which

293

makes it a convenient model to monitor proteolytic activation of the S protein at the cell surface

294

by exogenous proteases. Brieﬂy, confluent monolayers of Vero cells were infected with SARS-

295

CoV-2 for 24 h, and the infected cells were then subjected to buffers of different pH values. The

296

extent of cell-cell fusion, i.e., formation of syncytia, was determined using a fusion index that

297

expresses the average number of fusion events per original mononucleated cell (33). The index

298

reaches 1 when all the nuclei in the microscope ﬁeld are present in a single cell, and the value is

299

0 when all cells have one nucleus each. Formation of syncytia with two or more nuclei was

300

observed regardless of the pH of the buffer (Fig. 5C), and the fusion index did not significantly

301

differ when cells were treated with low pH or neutral buffers (Fig. 5D). Together, our observations

302

strongly suggested that low pH is not required for the SARS-CoV-2 fusion mechanisms.

303

Proteolytic Processing Is Sufficient and Necessary for SARS-CoV-2 Fusion

304

The results suggested that acidification is not required to prompt viral fusion and that proteolytic

305

processing might be sufficient. As furin and TMPRSS2 are believed to mediate the activation of

306

the SARS-CoV-2 spike proteins, we then evaluated the ability of the two proteases to trigger

307

SARS-CoV-2 activation and fusion using our flow cytometry-based infection analysis and syncytia-

308

forming assay. In the following series of experiments, exogenous trypsin was used to mimic

309

TMPRSS2 at the cell surface as the two enzymes are closely related and both belong to the group

310

of trypsin-like proteases. The use of exogenous cathepsin L was excluded because the enzyme

311

is only active at pH ~5, which would have made it impossible to distinguish between an effect due

312

to low pH or proteolytic cleavage.

313

Viral particles were first subjected to proteases prior to being added to Caco-2 and Vero

314

cells. We found that infection increased as much as 2- to 3-fold following the SARS-CoV-2

315

proteolytic processing by trypsin, whereas the pre-exposure of particles to furin had no apparent

316

effect (Fig. 6A). Similar results were obtained with our cell-cell fusion assay. Large syncytia with

317

five or more nuclei were observed when infected Vero cells were exposed to trypsin (Fig. 6B).

318

Contrary to trypsin-treated cells, no difference was observed after furin treatment in comparison

319

to the mock-treated samples, for which the only cells with more than one nucleus were those

320

dividing (Fig. 6B). Additionally, the fusion index in Vero cells was increased under trypsin treatment

321

compared to mock- and furin-treated cells (Fig. 6C). Altogether our data indicated that proteolytic

322

cleavage is sufficient and necessary for SARS-CoV-2 membrane fusion.

323

Endosomal Acidification Is Required for Endolysosomal Proteases Priming Viral Fusion

324

Our results support a model where endosomal acidification is not essential for SARS-CoV-2

325

membrane fusion, but SARS-CoV-2 infection relies on low pH for cathepsin L-dependent infection

326

in cells lacking TMPRSS2. Therefore, we tested the possibility that acid pH is required for the

327

activation of endolysosomal proteases that in turn trigger SARS-CoV-2 fusion. In such a scenario,

328

the spike S proteins that are already primed by proteases should no longer rely on low pH for

329

fusion. Indeed, we found that the fusion index was not increased when trypsin treatment was

330

followed by exposure to a decreasing pH of 7.4 to 5 (Fig. 7A and 7B), the latter value being typical

331

of the luminal pH of endolysosomes (29).

332

To further evaluate whether SARS-CoV-2 membrane fusion is low pH-independent, viral

333

particles were then exposed to buffers at pH ~5 and subsequently subjected to proteolytic

334

cleavage by trypsin. Our results revealed that SARS-CoV-2 infectivity was preserved when viral

335

particles were exposed to the low-pH buffer prior to trypsin treatment in comparison to virus

336

particles that were solely exposed to acidic pH (Fig. 7C). The infectivity also remained preserved

337

when the virus was first subjected to trypsin and then acidification. Taken together, the results

338

showed that endosomal acidification does not play a role in SARS-CoV-2 membrane fusion,

339

whether it occurs before or after the proteolytic processing of viral particles. In addition, our results

340

strongly suggested that the potential pH-induced conformational changes in the SARS-CoV-2

341

spikes were neither irreversible nor detrimental for the viral fusion.

342

To directly test whether endosomal acidification is needed for the host cell proteases that

343

prime SARS-CoV-2 fusion, and not for the fusion mechanisms themselves, we assessed whether

344

preactivated viral particles no longer depend on endosomal acidification for infectious entry. For

345

this purpose, the proteolytic processing of the virus particles was achieved with trypsin prior to the

346

infection of A549* and Vero cells. To interfere with the acid-dependent endolysosomal proteases,

347

the infection was carried out in the continuous presence of 50 nM of Bafilomycin A1. As A549*

348

and Vero cells do not express TMPRSS2, this assay allowed us to directly test the impact of

349

extracellular protease-activated viral particles. As reported above (Fig. 3C), infection with

350

untreated viral particles was severely hampered when proton pumps were blocked in the absence

351

of TMPRSS2 (Fig. 7D). In stark contrast, the protease-preactivated viral particles remained

352

infectious in the presence of Bafilomycin A1 (Fig. 7D).

353

The capacity of SARS-CoV-2 to infect A549* and Vero cells upon proteolytic activation,

354

despite the absence of functional endolysosomal proteases, was confirmed using NH4Cl. As

355

expected, in our synchronized infection assay, untreated particles became NH4Cl insensitive 50

356

min post entry (Fig. 7E, 7F, and 3E). However, when the viral particles were pretreated with

357

trypsin, no sensitivity to NH4Cl was observed (Fig. 7E and 7F). These results strongly supported

358

the view that, once activated by proteolytic cleavage, the virus is no longer dependent on

359

endosomal acidification for infection. Altogether, our data show that SARS-CoV-2 resembles other

360

CoVs in that its entry depends on diverse host cell proteases. It can use two distinct routes, where

361

either TMPRSS2 mediates its pH-independent penetration from or close to the cell surface or

362

alternatively, it is transported to endolysosomes, where low pH activates cathepsin L that in turn

363

primes viral fusion and penetration.

364

Discussion

365

The infectious entry process of CoVs is complex (3). Several host cell proteases can prime the

366

CoV spike S proteins for viral membrane fusion, but it is not yet known whether these mechanisms

367

require selective proteases or a coordinated, spatio-temporal combination of several proteases.

368

The importance of endosomal acidification in the productive penetration of all CoVs is also a

369

matter of debate. Furin, TMPRSS2, and cathepsin L have all three been implicated in coronavirus

370

activation for entry (5, 7, 17, 22, 23), and agents elevating endosomal pH such as chloroquine

371

have been described to interfere with infection (7, 10, 11). SARS-CoV-2 and other CoVs have

372

apparently found a way to use diverse entry mechanisms to infect target cells and spread

373

throughout the host.

374

In this study, we developed reliable and accurate assays to investigate SARS-CoV-2

375

infection in lung, intestine, and kidney epithelial cells, from proteolytic activation to membrane

376

fusion. In agreement with other reports (7, 25), our results showed that SARS-CoV-2 infection was

377

sensitive to inhibitors of TMPRSS2 and cathepsin L. We further found that blocking TMPRSS2

378

abrogated infection even when the cells were expressing cathepsin L, indicating that the virus

379

does not reach endolysosomal cathepsins when TMPRSS2 is present. Others have shown that

380

infection by MERS pseudo-viruses was suppressed by trypsin-like protease inhibitors in the

381

presence of the tetraspanin CD9, while entry was unaffected but rather blocked by cathepsin

382

inhibitors in the absence of CD9 (34). These authors proposed that tetraspanins condense CoV

383

entry factors into localized positions on or close to the cell surface, allowing rapid and efficient

384

activation of viral fusion (35).

385

We observed that SARS-CoV-2 used two distinct routes to enter cells, one fast (~10 min)

386

which corresponded to the timing of TMPRSS2 activation, and the second slower (40-50 min)

387

corresponding to cathepsin L priming. Although other cellular factors are likely necessary, our

388

results support the view that TMPRSS2 is a major determinant of the SARS-CoV-2 fast entry track.

389

Similar observations have been made for the human CoV 229E (hCoV-229E), which prefers cell-

390

surface TMPRSS2 to endosomal cathepsins for cell entry (36-38).

391

It is clear from our data that, in the presence of TMPRSS2, SARS-CoV-2 did not rely on

392

endosomal acidification for infectious penetration. Concanamycin B, which specifically inhibits

393

vATPases and elevates endosomal pH, affected UUKV, an enveloped virus that penetrates host

394

cells by acid-activated membrane fusion (26), but not SARS-CoV-2. This was consistent with

395

reports that TMPRSS2 processes CoV S and other substrates at or nearby the plasma membrane

396

(39, 40), i.e., at neutral pH. Using aprotinin, we found that half of the bound viral particles required

397

5-10 min to pass the TMPRSS2-dependent step. We cannot completely exclude that aprotinin

398

was not instantaneously effective when it was added to the infected cells. In this case, the timing

399

of TMPRSS2-requiring step was therefore faster. SARS-CoV-2 activation and penetration would

400

then likely take place at the plasma membrane following proteolytic activation, as proposed for

401

hCoV-229E and MERS-CoV (37, 41).

402

An alternative scenario would be that SARS-CoV-2 is sorted into the endocytic machinery

403

regardless of the TMPRSS2 expression. The time course of TMPRSS2-requiring step resembled

404

that of cargo sorted into EEs, circa 5-10 min (31). Another observation supporting this hypothesis

405

was that colcemid hampered infection. This drug perturbates LE maturation by disrupting the

406

microtubule network, and in turn, causes the accumulation and dysfunction of EEs (26). Such a

407

strategy has been proposed for reoviruses, which use similar uptake but different trafficking

408

depending on whether viral particles are activated or not (42). Like other CoVs (39), more

409

functional investigations are required to determine, where exactly, from the plasma membrane or

410

EEs, SARS-CoV-2 enters the cytosol of TMRPSS2+ cells, and whether the processing of the S

411

protein is followed by transport of the virus to downstream organelles for penetration.

412

In the absence of TMPRSS2, it was evident that SARS-CoV-2 was dependent on

413

endocytosis and transport through the late endosomal system for infectious penetration. Infectious

414

entry was inhibited by endosomal-pH neutralizing drugs. Impairing LE maturation by either

19

415

colcemid or the expression of Rab7a T22N affected SARS-CoV-2 infection. The sensitivity to MG-

416

132 mirrored observations with UUKV, IAV, and murine CoVs, which accumulated in cytosolic

417

vesicles and failed to infect (26, 30, 43). Others have reported that SARS-CoV-2 depends on

418

PIKfyve for the infection of 293T cells, a line devoid of TMPRSS2 (10). PIKfyve is a

419

phosphoinositide kinase involved in the first stages of LE maturation. Collectively, our results

420

indicate that SARS-CoV-2, like other CoVs (41, 44, 45), has a dependence on functional

421

endolysosomes and cathepsins for infectious penetration when the viral particles are not activated

422

at or near the cell surface.

423

Our results suggested that the proteolytic activation of the spike S protein was sufficient and

424

necessary for SARS-CoV-2 fusion. The Vero cells used in our virus-mediated cell-cell fusion assay

425

did not express TMPRSS2 on the cell surface. In this assay, exogenous furin failed to promote

426

the syncytia formation, indicating that either furin was inefficient or not sufficient to achieve the full

427

activation of the SARS-CoV-2 protein S at the plasma membrane. The S1/S2 site exhibits a RRAR

428

motif instead the typical RX(R/K)R furin one, and a recent structural study support the view that

429

the cleavage by furin at this site in the S trimers is rather low, about 30% (17, 46, 47). However,

430

we found that, unlike furin, trypsin prompted the formation of syncytia, which rather supports the

431

involvement of proteases in the target cells, such as TMPRSS2 and cathepsin L, to complete the

432

proteolytic processing of the S protein. Others have shown that SARS-CoV-2, and also MERS-

433

CoV, mediate cell-cell fusion at neutral pH without any further proteolytic treatment when target

434

cells express TMPRSS2 (16, 48).

435

It is also apparent from our results that the SARS-CoV-2 progeny was not fully processed

436

and activated. Trypsin pretreatment increased the virus infectivity. More work is evidently required

437

to decipher the SARS-CoV-2 fusion mechanism. The list of the involved host cell proteases is

438

most likely not restricted to TMPRSS2 and cathepsin L, as suggested by a recent biochemistry

439

study (49). The S proteolytic activation might involve the cleavage of other sites than S1/S2 and

440

S2’, similarly to what was found for the MERS-CoV protein S (40). It is, however, tempting to

20

441

postulate that the cleavage between S1 and S2 is not complete on SARS-CoV-2 particles, with

442

only one or two of the three S1/S2 sites cut by furin within S trimers. In this model, cutting all the

443

S1/S2 sites would be achieved by proteases in target cells such as TMPRSS2 and cathepsin L.

444

The fusogenic conformational change would then occur and be completed by the cleavage of the

445

S2’ sites, therefore, unmasking the fusogenic units. The S1/S2 site significantly differs in amino-

446

acid residues through CoVs (17) and highly likely influences the overall viral fusion process.

447

We found that the level of virus mRNA and infectious viral progeny released in the outer

448

media was lower in the absence of TMPRSS2. The TMPRSS2-dependent entry mechanisms

449

occurred faster than the cathepsin L-activated pathway, and it might be that the early route results

450

in a more productive infection than the late-penetrating process. Separate studies support, at least

451

for some CoV strains including HCoV-229E, the view that early entry results in productive

452

infection, while late penetration would be an alternative, backup route (35, 37, 38). Other works

453

on therapeutics have linked host cell proteases to CoV spread. Inhibitors of TMPRSS2, but not of

454

cathepsins, effectively prevent the pathogenesis of SARS-CoV in mice, suggesting that SARS-

455

CoV mainly uses cell surface proteases rather than endosomal cathepsins in vivo (50). The

456

identification of all host cell proteases involved in SARS-CoV-2 and other CoV infection, as well

457

as the tissues and organs that express them, remains an important objective to better understand

458

viral propagation and induced diseases.

459

Intriguingly, SARS-CoV-2 showed a strong resistance to acidic buffers. Exposure to pH ~5.0

460

only marginally inactivated the virus, and infectivity was even rescued and enhanced by proteolytic

461

treatment. In addition, trypsin activation appeared to protect the virus from acid inactivation, which

462

could explain how it is found to infect the gastrointestinal tract in vivo. SARS-CoV-2 has evidently

463

developed a remarkable ability to adapt to an acidic environment. Interestingly, low pH has been

464

shown to switch the positioning of the receptor-binding domain in the SARS-CoV-2 S trimers,

465

which could help the virus to escape the immune system (51). Overall, this property certainly

466

confers the virus the ability to sustain a high infectivity, not only within endosomes to enter host

467

cells, but also in the extracellular space, especially during the virus spread throughout the host.

468

Reports on the cell entry of SARS-CoV-2 and other CoVs often describe only one cell model

469

system, and the literature in this field remains confusing in general. Our study recapitulates within

470

a single investigation the SARS-CoV-2 entry process and provides an overview of the cellular

471

mechanisms used by SARS-CoV-2 to penetrate and infect target cells. Although it remains to be

472

confirmed under physiological conditions, we propose that SARS-CoV-2 can enter cells through

473

two distinct, mutually exclusive pathways. When target cells express TMPRSS2, the virus is

474

activated at or close to the cell surface and penetrates early in a pH-independent manner. When

475

target cells are devoid of TMPRSS2, SARS-CoV-2 is endocytosed and sorted into the

476

endolysosomes from where the virus is activated in a pH-dependent manner and penetrates the

477

cytosol late. With the ability to subvert diverse cell entry routes, SARS-CoV-2 has likely found a

478

way to expand the number of target tissues and organs, which certainly contributes to the broad

479

tropism of the virus in vivo.

492

Viruses

493

SARS-CoV-2 (strain BavPat1) was obtained from Prof. Christian Drosten at the Charité in Berlin,

494

Germany, and provided via the European Virology Archive. The virus was amplified in Vero cells

495

and working stocks were used after three passages. Uukuniemi (UUKV) and Semliki forest (SFV)

496

viruses were previously described and amplified in BHK-21 cells (52, 53). The MOI is given

497

according to the titer determined by plaque- or foci-forming unit assay for each cell line. When

498

indicated, the titer was obtained by TCID50.

499

506

Margaret Kielian (Albert Einstein College of Medicine, USA). mAb 8B11A3 and mAb against SFV

507

E2 were used at a dilution of 1:400 for flow cytometry analysis. The rabbit antibodies against

508

TMPRSS2 (ab92323) and actin (A2066) were obtained from Abcam and Sigma, respectively. The

509

mouse mAb against cathepsin L (BMS1032) and -tubulin (T5158) were bought from Thermo

510

Fisher Scientific and Sigma, respectively. Anti-mouse secondary antibodies were conjugated to

511

Alexa Fluor (AF) 405 (Molecular Probes), AF488 (Molecular Probes), IRDye 700 (LI-COR), IRDye

512

800CW (LI-COR), and horseradish peroxidase (HRP; Vector Laboratories). Anti-rabbit secondary

513

antibodies conjugated to IRDye 800CW were purchased from LI-COR. NH4Cl (Sigma), aprotinin

514

(Cayman Chemical), and chloroquine diphosphate (Sigma) stocks were dissolved in water.

515

Bafilomycin A1 (BioViotica), Concanamycin B (BioViotica), SB412515 (Cayman Chemical),

516

colcemid (Cayman Chemical), and MG-132 (Selleck Chemicals) were all dissolved in DMSO.

517

Furin and Trypsin were purchased from R&D and Sigma, respectively. Plasmids encoding EGFP-

518

tagged Rab7a, Rab7a T22N, and Rab7a Q67L have been described elsewhere (26).

519

Protein analysis

520

Cells were lysed with phosphate buffer saline (PBS) containing 0.1% Triton X-100 (Merck

521

Millipore), according to a standard procedure (54). Cell lysates were then diluted in LDS sample

522

buﬀer (Thermo Fisher Scientiﬁc) and analyzed by SDS-PAGE (Nu-PAGE Novex 10% Bis-Tris

523

gels; Thermo Fisher Scientiﬁc). Proteins were subsequently transferred to polyvinylidene

524

diﬂuoride membranes (iBlot transfer stacks; Thermo Fisher Scientiﬁc). The membranes were ﬁrst

525

blocked with Intercept blocking buffer (LI-COR) and then incubated with primary antibodies against

526

TMPRSS2, cathepsin L, actin, and -tubulin, all diluted in Tris-buﬀered saline containing 0.1%

527

Tween and Intercept blocking buffer (1:1,000, 1:400, 1:5,000, and 1:2,000, respectively). After

528

extensive washing, the membranes were incubated with the corresponding secondary anti-

529

species conjugated to either IRDye 700 and 800CW (both at 1:10,000) or HRP (1:1,000). Proteins

were analyzed with a LI-COR Odyssey CLx scanner, or alternatively, detected with SuperSignal

531

West Pico PLUS chemiluminescent substrate (Thermo Fisher Scientiﬁc) and an iNTAS ECL

532

Chemostar analyzer.

533

Virus infection

534

Cells were exposed to viruses at the indicated MOIs in the presence of 2% FBS for 1 h at 37°C.

535

Virus input was then replaced by complete culture medium, and infected cells were incubated for

536

8 h before fixation. For virus-mediated cell-cell fusion, Vero cells were infected for 24 h. Cells that

537

transiently express EGFP-Rab7a and related mutants were infected 18 h post-transfection. For

538

pH-inactivation, citric acid, 2-(N-morpholino)-ethanesulfonic acid (MES), and 4-(2-hydroxyethyl)-

539

1-piperazineethanesulfonic acid (HEPES) were used as buffers at 100 mM as follow, pH < 5.5,

540

5.5 < pH < 6.5, and 6.5 < pH, respectively. Virus inputs were exposed to buffers at the indicated

541

pH for 10 min at 37°C and then to buffers at neutral pH prior infection. For furin- or trypsin-

542

activation, SARS-CoV-2 was pretreated with furin (1 µg.mL-1) or trypsin (100 µg.mL-1),

543

respectively, for 15 min at 37°C and allowed to infect cells. For inhibition assays, cells were

544

pretreated with drugs for 30 min at 37°C, apart from colcemid pretreatment that lasted 3 h on ice,

545

and then exposed to viruses in the continuous presence of the inhibitors. For inhibitor add-in time

546

courses, virus binding to cells was synchronized on ice for 90 min. Cells were then rapidly warmed

547

to 37°C, and SB412515 (10 µM), aprotinin (30 µM), NH4Cl (at indicated concentrations),

548

Concanamycin B (50 nM), and MG-132 (at indicated concentrations) were added at indicated

549

times. Cells were subsequently incubated at 37°C and harvested 8 h after the warm shift. Infection

550

was monitored by either flow cytometry, fluorescence microscopy, or qRT-PCR. When infection

551

was analyzed by microscopy, cells were seeded on Lab-Tek or iBIDI glass bottom 8-well chamber

552

slides.

553

DNA transfection

554

As previously described (56), Vero cells were transfected with 750 ng of plasmids using

555

Lipofectamine

556

recommendations and washed 5 h later.

557

Immunofluorescence microscopy

558

Fluorescence microscopy was extensively described in (57). Briefly, infected cells were rinsed

559

with PBS, permeabilized with 0.5% Triton X-100 (Sigma) for 15 min at room temperature (RT),

560

and stained with primary antibodies diluted in PBS for 1h at RT. Subsequently, cells were

561

extensively washed and incubated with secondary antibodies in the presence of 4′,6-diamidino-2-

562

phenylindole (DAPI, Molecular Probes) for 45 min at RT. Samples were imaged with an

563

epifluorescence microscope Nikon Eclipse Ti-S (Nikon), whilst a Leica TCS SP8 confocal

564

microscope was used to image syncytia.

565

Flow cytometry

566

The flow cytometry-based infection assay has been described previously (53). Briefly, infected

567

cells were fixed with 4% formaldehyde for 30 min at RT and permeabilized with 0.1% saponin

568

(Serva). Cells were then exposed to primary antibody at RT for 1 h, washed, and subsequently

569

incubated with secondary anti-mouse antibodies at RT for another 1 h. Infected cells were

570

quantified with a FACSCelesta cytometer (Becton Dickinson) and FlowJo software (TreeStar).

571

Virus RNA quantification

572

As previously reported (58), RNA was harvested from cells using the NuceloSpin RNA extraction

573

kit (Machery-Nagel) according to manufacturer’s instructions. The cDNA was synthesized using

574

iSCRIPT reverse transcriptase (BioRad) from 250 ng of total RNA as per supplier

575

recommendations. q-PCR was performed using iTaq SYBR green (BioRad) following the

576

manufacturer’s instructions for the SARS-CoV-2 genome using the forward primer,

2000

(Invitrogen)

GCCTCTTCTCGTTCC, and the reverse primer, AGCAGCATCACCGCC. HPRT1 was used as a

578

housekeeping gene using the forward primer, CCTGGCGTCGTGATTAGTGAT, and reverse

579

primer, AGACGTTCAGTCCTGTCCATAA.

580

Virus titration by TCID50 assay

581

Confluent monolayers of Vero and Caco-2 cells in 96-well plates were infected with 10-fold serial

582

dilutions of SARS-CoV-2. Infected cells were fixed 24 hpi and subjected to immunostaining using

583

the primary mouse mAb anti-SARS-CoV-2 NP and then the secondary anti-mouse antibody

584

800CW (1:10,000). Samples were finally scanned on LI-COR.

585

Cell-cell fusion

586

Infected cells were washed in PBS and treated with DMEM containing 0.2% bovine serum albumin

587

(Gibco) buffered at pH 7.4, 6.0, or 5.0 using 30 mM of HEPES, MES, or citric acid, respectively,

588

for 5 min at 37°C. Alternatively, infected cells were exposed to furin (1 µg.mL-1) and trypsin (100

589

µg.mL-1) for 5 min at 37°C, and when indicated, followed by acidification of the culture medium as

590

described above. Subsequently, cells were washed and incubated in complete medium for 50 min,

591

and the cytosol stained with CellMask Deep Red (1:1,000, Molecular Probes) for 10 min at 37°C.

592

After fixation, cells were rinsed with PBS, and nuclei stained with Hoechst 33258 (0.5 µg.mL -1,

593

Thermo Fisher Scientific). Syncytia were monitored by fluorescence microscopy as described

594

below. Fusion was quantified by counting the number of cells and nuclei present in a microscope

595

field. A fusion index (f) was calculated according to the equation f = (1 – [c/n]), where c is the

596

number of cells in a field after fusion and n the number of nuclei. An average field contained 50-

597

60 nuclei.
