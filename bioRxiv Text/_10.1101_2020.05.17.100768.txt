Abstract
Since December 2019 a novel a coronavirus identified as SARS-CoV-2 or COV2 has
been spreading around the world. On the 16th of May around 4.5 million people got
infected and over 300,000 ​died due to the infection of COV2. The effective treatment
remains a challenge. Targeted therapeutics are still under investigation. The
papain-like protease (PL​Pro​) from the human SARS-CoV-2 coronavirus is a cysteine
protease that plays a critical role in virus replication. Its activity is required to process
the viral polyprotein into functional, mature subunits. Moreover, COV2 uses this
enzyme to modulate the host’s immune system to its own benefit. Therefore, it
represents a highly promising target for the development of antiviral drugs.
In this work, we discovered that ebselen, a synthetic organoselenium drug molecule
with anti-inflammatory, anti-oxidant and cytoprotective activity in mammalian cells
and cytotoxicity in lower organisms, is a highly active inhibitor of PL​Pro​CoV2. We
proved that ebselen is a covalent, fast-binding inhibitor of PL​Pro​CoV2 exhibiting a low
micromolar potency. Furthermore, we identified a difference between PL​Pro from
SARS-CoV-1 (the corona virus which caused the 2002–2004 outbreak, SARS) and
SARS-CoV-2 that allows to explain the difference in dynamics of the replication, and,
thus, the disease progression. Namely, we present that they show differences in the
binding affinity of substrates that we observed through kinetics and molecular
docking studies. Using a novel Approximate Bayesian Computation method we were
able to find kinetic constants for both enzymes. Molecular modeling study on the
structure of the active site and binding mode of the ebselen with SARS and COV2
showed also significant differences that could explain our observation that ebselen is
less active and slower bounding with SARS than COV2.
In conclusion, we show that ebselen inhibits the activity of the essential viral enzyme
papain-like protease (PLpro) from SARS-COV-2 in low micromolar range.

Introduction
More than 16 years after the global pandemic due to the SARS (severe acute
respiratory syndrome) coronavirus (CoV), no anti-coronaviral medications have been
developed for the treatment of infection caused by human coronaviruses (HCoV).
SARS-CoV-1 (SARS) was identified as the causative agent of the fatal global
outbreak of respiratory disease in humans during 2002–2003 and resulted in 8,422
cases with a case fatality rate (CFR) of 11% [1]. ​In September 2012 another
SARS-like respiratory virus (termed Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus,
MERS-CoV) had been established. MERS coronavirus spread around the world with
a total of 178 laboratory-confirmed cases, but a CFR of as much as 43% [2] showing
us how fatal the interspecies transmission potential of CoVs can be.
In December 2019, a novel coronavirus severe acute respiratory syndrome
coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2, CoV2) formerly known as the 2019 novel coronavirus
(2019-nCoV), was discovered in Wuhan, China and was sequenced and isolated by
January 2020 [4]. The disease, now termed coronavirus disease 19 (COVID-19),
rapidly spread within China and infected a much larger number of people causing
world economic and social paralysis. On May 16, 2020 nearly 4.5 million
laboratory-confirmed infections were reported around the world, including over
300,000 deaths [5]. SARS-CoV-1 and SARS-CoV-2 are closely related, with studies
highlighting that SARS-CoV-2 genes share >80% nucleotide identity and 89.10%
nucleotide similarity with SARS-CoV genes [4].
The development of anti-coronaviral drugs remains challenging although a number
of coronaviral proteins have been identified as potential drug targets [6,7]. Two of the
most promising are Papain-like protease (PL​Pro​) and Main protease (M​pro​, also known
as chymotrypsin-like protease 3CL​pro​) [6-8]. These proteases play an essential role in
polypeptide processing during virus replication. PL​pro​, in addition to being crucial
during replication via processing of the viral polyprotein [9], is proposed to be a key
enzyme in the sustained pathogenesis of SARS-CoV. This includes deubiquitination
[10] (the removal of ubiquitin), and deISGylation [11] (the removal of ISG15) from
host-cell proteins. These last two enzymatic activities result in the antagonism of the
host antiviral innate immune response [12]. As a result, PL​pro is an important potential
target for antiviral drugs that may inhibit viral replication and weaken dysregulation of
signalling cascades in infected cells that may lead to cell death in surrounding,
uninfected cells [8].
Very recent studies led by Dikic confirmed the PL​Pro from SARS-CoV-2 (PL​Pro​CoV2)
to be an essential viral enzyme and potential weak spot [13]. They proposed PL​pro to

be Achilles’ heel of SARS-CoV-2. PL​Pro from SARS-CoV-1 (PL​Pro​SARS) and
PL​Pro​CoV2 are closely related, with 82.9% sequence identity, and relatively distant
from PL​Pro ​from MERS (32.9% identity). The removal of ubiquitin has been also
recently confirmed by Rut et al. in [14].
Ebselen is a low-molecular-weight organoselenium drug that shows pleiotropic mode
of action and due to its very low toxicity there are no barriers to using it in humans
[15]. It is a well-known agent with therapeutic activity in neurological disorders [16]
and cancers [17]. It also showed an antiviral effect on neurotropic viruses [18] and
hepatitis C virus [19]. In a very recent work ebselen has been shown to attenuate
inflammation and promote microbiome recovery in mice after antibiotic treatment for
CDIAs [20]. Another recently published work proposed via virtual screening ebselen
as a possible inhibitor of M​pro​ from SARS-CoV-2 [21].
Several lines of evidence demonstrated the biological effects of ebselen is mainly
due to its antioxidant properties and capability of forming selenenyl-sulfide bonds
with the cysteine residues in proteins [16,22-25].
Here, we demonstrate that ebselen inhibits activity of the essential viral enzyme,
namely, papain-like protease (PL​pro​) from SARS-CoV-2 (PL​pro​CoV2) in low
micromolar range. Moreover, we have identified the mechanism of inhibition as fast
and irreversible as well as propose the binding mode of ebselen by molecular
docking. We have found a difference in the mechanism of catalysis, the inhibition
and the active sites between PL​Pro from SARS-CoV-1 and SARS-CoV-2.
Furthermore, we used the recently published Approximate Bayesian Computation
(ABC) methodology [26] to find kinetic parameters of the catalysis of Ubiquitin
conjugated with fluorophore by PL​pro​SARS and PL​pro​CoV2. Our findings help to
understand differences between SARS-CoV-1 and SARS-CoV-2 by analysing PL​pro​,
and further indicate that ebselen is a highly active inhibitor of PL​Pro​CoV2 and indeed
is a potential drug against COVID-19.
Results
Following the high potential of ebselen as a promising drug, we sought to test its
efficacy in the inhibition of the enzyme that is crucial in viral replication, namely,
PL​pro​. Deep analysis of the active site of and mechanism of catalysis of
coronaviruses PL​pro led us to conclude that small molecules with planar phenyl
moieties, which also are able to modify cysteine residue active site, could be
effective (Figure 1).
PL​pro from coronaviruses belong to the peptidase clan CA (family C16). The active
site contains a classic catalytic triad composed of Cys–His–Asp. We analysed the
active site and the mechanism based on the crystal structure of PL​pro from

SARS-CoV-1 published by Báez-Santos et al. in [8,26] that showed PL​Pro​SARS has a
catalytic triad composed of Cys112–His273–Asp287. This catalytic triad transforms
the -SH group from cystine into a strong nucleophilic ion that attacks the carboxylic
group of peptide bonds and leads to hydrolysis (Figure 1 (left)). The side chain sulfur
atom of Cys112 is positioned 3.7 Å from the nitrogen in position 1 of the imidazole
ring in catalytic histidine (His273). One of the oxygen atoms of the side chain of
catalytic aspartic acid (Asp287) is located 2.7 Å from the nitrogen in position 3 of the
same histidine (Figure 1). The side chain of Trp107 that is located within the
oxyanion hole. The indole-ring nitrogen was proposed to participate in the
stabilization of the negatively charged tetrahedral transition state of the reaction
intermediates produced throughout catalysis [8,26,27].

Ebselen (Figure 1) meets active site requirements, size and conformation, and the
ability to modify the -SH group. Moreover, ebselen possesses a clean safety profile
in human clinical trials that in case of positive results can lead directly to discovering
effective drugs against COVID-19. Encouraged by our analysis, we decided to test
ebselen against both PL​Pro​ enzymes from SARS-CoV-1 and SARS-CoV-2.
As a substrate for our study we chose Ubiquitin conjugated with fluorophore
(Ub-AMC). Progress curves (Figures 2A and 2C) at different levels of substrate
concentration showed an interesting difference between two enzymes. PL​Pro​SARS
catalyzed the reaction faster and achieved saturation. We estimated kinetic
parameters of hydrolysis of Ub-AMC (Table 1) using the recently published novel
Approximate Bayesian Computation (ABC) computational tool for calculating kinetic
constants in the Michaelis–Menten equation [28]. This extremely useful framework
gives us the opportunity to find the turnover number (​k​cat​), the Michaelis Menten
constant (​KM​​ ) and, as a consequence, the catalytic efficiency of the enzyme (​k​cat​/​K​M​)
without using high concentrations of Ub-AMC (Figures 2B and 2D).

The catalytic efficiency (​k​cat​/​K​M​) is often used as a specificity constant to compare the
relative rates of reactions. Here we show that this ratio is three times higher for
PL​Pro​SARS compared to PL​Pro​CoV2 that indicates its higher capability to hydrolyze
Ub-AMC. PL​Pro is required for the processing of viral polypeptides and to modulate
the host’s immune response, the higher efficiency may well contribute to the fact that
once infected, SARS-CoV-1 was overall more aggressive and the disease developed
faster.
We applied ebselen as a possible inhibitor and, indeed, it suppresses PL​Pro activity
from CoV2 with inhibition constants approximately equal 2 μM (Table ​1 and Figure

3). We determined the mechanism of inhibition of ebselen as irreversible, with
steady-state binding being achieved immediately. Ebslen appeared to be an
irreversible inhibitor of the studied ​PL​Pro​SARS as well, although in this case inhibition
was weaker and the kinetics of binding was slow (Table 2). Irreversibility seems to
confirm our first assumption that the inhibition of both enzymes can be associated
with covalent bonds between Se from ebselen and S from cysteine. We confirmed
irreversibility via dialysis and attemption of reactivation of the enzymes.

Our results were further illustrated by the use of molecular modeling to study the
binding mode of ebselen with PL​Pro​SARS (Figure 4) and PL​Pro​CoV2 (Figure 4 and 5).
This study confirmed our primary assumption that ebselen binds to the PL​Pro​CoV2
active site covalently and, thus, convinced us of our hypothesis about an irreversible
mechanism of inhibition.
In PL​Pro​SARS catalytic triad Cys112–His273–Asp287 is exposed externally out of
the protein. The model with the most favorable thermodynamic stability shows that
ebselen occupies an intersection between the putative catalytic triad
Cys112–His273–Asp287 and Trp107, as we hypothesized. The ​N-​ phenyl ring of
ebselen is surrounded by the aromatic ring of Trp107 (edge-to-face interaction) and
Lys106. Amine group from Lys106 additionally interacts with oxygen from ebselen.
Another edge-to-face interaction, we identified between ​Se​-ring and an imidazole
side chain of His290.
Ebselen is buried deeper in the active site of PL​pro​CoV2 than of PL​pro​SARS. This
results from different conformation of the enzyme. In the PL​pro​CoV2 the catalytic triad
Cys111–His272–Asp286 in each of three subunits are directed to the center of the
protein. The most preferable conformation shows that the molecule occupies the
same intersection between catalytic Cys111–His272–Asp286 triad and Trp106 but is
additionally wrapped by other amino acids (Tyr268, Ala289, Leu298). Here, we
identified a different binding mode where the ​Se​-phenyl is directed to the oxyanion
hole and Trp106, not ​N​-phenyl as it was observed for PL​Pro​SARS. The ​Se​-phenyl
(from ebselen fragment) and an indole (from Cys322) formed π–π stacking
interactions, while face-to-edge stacking interactions were observed with an aromatic
ring from Tyr 268. The ​N-​ phenyl ring of ebselen adopts a bent-shaped conformation
that fits well to the space between Leu298 and Ala288 forming π-alkyl interaction
with them. The smaller distance between the oxyanion hole and ligand as well as
more interactions with amino acids surrounding the active site in PL​pro​CoV2 could
explain a better binding affinity observed in our experiments.

Discussion
The present study provides an understanding of differences between SARS-CoV-1
and SARS-CoV-2 by analysing PL​pro and further highlights high potential of ebselen
as a treatment for novel coronavirus appeared in December 2019. PL​pro​CoV2 is an
essential viral enzyme that is required for the processing of viral polypeptides and
assembling of new viral particles within human cells [13].
We first estimated parameters of kinetic constants and the catalytic efficiency of the
catalysis of Ub-AMC by PL​pro​SARS and PL​pro​CoV2 (see Figure 2 and Table 1). Our
results suggest that the capability to hydrolyze Ub-AMC is three times higher for
PL​Pro​SARS compared to PL​Pro​CoV2. This observation is well-aligned with the fact
that SARS-CoV-1 is more aggressive than SARS-CoV-2 and leads to a faster
development of a disease.
Further, we showed that ebselen inhibits the enzyme PL​Pro​CoV2 and suppresses its
activity with inhibition constants approximately equal 2 μM (see Figure 3 and Table
2). Moreover, we indicated that ebslen appeared to be an irreversible inhibitor of
both PL​Pro​CoV2 and PL​Pro​SARS. However, it is weaker in the case of PL​Pro​SARS.
Eventually, we studied the binding mode of ebselen with PL​Pro​SARS (Figure 4) and
PL​Pro​CoV2 (Figure 5) with the use of molecular modeling. The obtained results firmly
corroborated our primary assumption that ebselen binds to the PL​Pro​CoV2 active site
covalently. This observation reinforces our view regarding the irreversibility of the
mechanism of PL​Pro​CoV2 enzyme inhibition by ebselen and will aid in finding variants
of the compound with further improved efficacy.

Material and methods

4. Molecular Modeling
Molecular modeling studies were performed using the Discovery Studio 2020
(Dassault Systemes BIOVIA Corp). The crystal structure of the SARS-CoV-1 and
SARS-CoV-2 (PDB ID 2FE8 [26] and 6W9C [29], respectively) with protons added
(assuming the protonation state of pH 7.5) was used as the starting point for
calculations of the enzyme complexed with ebselen. The partial charges of all atoms
were computed using the Momany-Rone algorithm. Minimization was performed
using the Smart Minimizer algorithm and the CHARMm force field up to an energy
change of 0.0 or RMS gradient of 0.01. Generalized Born model was applied. The
nonbond radius was set to 14 Å.
