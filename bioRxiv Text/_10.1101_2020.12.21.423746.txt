Abstract

34

There is an urgent requirement for safe and effective vaccines to prevent novel

35

coronavirus disease (COVID-19) caused by SARS-CoV-2. A concern for the

36

development of new viral vaccines is the potential to induce vaccine-enhanced

37

disease (VED). This was reported in several preclinical studies with both SARS-CoV-

38

1 and MERS vaccines but has not been reported with SARS-CoV-2 vaccines. We

39

have used ferret and rhesus macaques challenged with SARS-CoV-2 to assess the

40

potential for VED in animals vaccinated with formaldehyde-inactivated SARS-CoV-2

41

(FIV) formulated with Alhydrogel, compared to a negative control vaccine in ferrets or

42

unvaccinated macaques. We showed no evidence of enhanced disease in ferrets or

43

rhesus macaques given FIV except for mild transient enhanced disease seen at

44

seven days post infection in ferrets. This increased lung pathology was observed

early in the infection (day 7) but was resolved by day 15. We also demonstrate that

46

formaldehyde treatment of SARS-CoV-2 reduces exposure of the spike receptor

Introduction.

50

Novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19) caused by SARS-CoV-2 is a global

51

pandemic with a cumulative total of over 63 million cases and 1.4 million deaths

52

reported as of 2nd December 20201. Consequently, there is an urgent requirement to

53

develop safe and effective vaccines to prevent COVID-192. Currently 52 vaccine

54

candidates are in clinical evaluation (11 at Phase 3) with 162 listed as in pre-clinical

55

evaluation (WHO draft landscape of COVID-19 vaccines – 8 December 2020). The

56

leading vaccine candidates in Phase 3 studies include a non-replicating viral vector,

57

three inactivated virus vaccines and two vaccines based on mRNA technology 3.

58

Promising clinical results from phase 2/3 studies are available for mRNA-based

59

vaccines4 5, the adenovirus vaccine (ChAdOx1nCoV-19/AZD1222)6, which

60

expresses a codon-optimised full-length spike protein (S) and whole virus vaccines

61

grown in Vero cells and inactivated with β-propiolactone7 8 9. These vaccines have

62

also been evaluated for protection in non-human primates following challenge with

63

SARS-CoV-2. The virus induces only mild to moderate disease in macaques but

64

these vaccines reduce viral loads and pathology in the upper and lower respiratory

65

tracts to varying degrees10 8 7 11.

66

A concern for the development of new viral vaccines is the potential to induce

67

vaccine enhanced disease12 (VED) which has been associated with prior pre-clinical

68

studies of both SARS and MERS vaccines. The most studied mechanism of VED is

antibody-dependent enhancement (ADE) of disease, reviewed recently by Arvin et

70

al.13. It has been suggested that ADE could be a consequence of low affinity

71

antibodies that bind to viral proteins but have limited neutralising activity 14. The

72

vaccine enhancement of disease by ADE mechanisms was described in children

73

given formaldehyde-inactivated respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) vaccines in the

74

1960s15, measles vaccines16 and in dengue haemorrhagic fever due to secondary

75

infection with a heterologous dengue serotype17.

76

There is limited evidence of ADE with SARS-CoV-1 vaccines in animal models and

77

whilst it has not been reported in the majority of vaccine studies, a study that used

78

formalin or ultraviolet-inactivated SARS-CoV-1 observed that older mice developed

79

pulmonary pathology with an eosinophil infiltrate18. A further study demonstrated

80

protection in mice following immunisation with formalin or ultraviolet light-inactivated

81

SARS-CoV-1, but animals developed eosinophilic pulmonary infiltrates19. A modified

82

vaccinia virus Ankara expressing S protein (MVA-S) was not protective in ferrets

83

challenged with SARS-CoV-1, but liver inflammation was noted20. Formalin-

84

inactivated SARS-CoV-1 vaccines were protective in rhesus macaques21, but also

85

promoted lymphocytic infiltrates and alveolar oedema with fibrin deposition after

86

challenge22. Likewise, MVA expressing S protein showed protection in one study23,

87

but greater occurrence of diffuse alveolar damage than seen in control animals

88

following challenge. Fortuitously, VED has not been reported in the numerous

89

SARS-CoV-2 efficacy animal challenge vaccine studies published to date. However,

90

these studies were primarily designed to assess efficacy and not VED.

91

We have developed a ferret intranasal SARS-CoV-2 infection model where viral

92

shedding and mild lung pathology is observed and re-challenged animals are fully

93

protected24. We have also evaluated both rhesus and cynomolgus macaques for

94

their susceptibility to SARS-CoV-2 challenge and showed the development of

95

pulmonary lesions in both species which are equivalent to those seen in mild clinical

96

cases in humans25. In order to interrogate the potential for VED in ferrets and rhesus

97

macaques to support future safety studies on novel COVID-19 vaccines, we

98

prepared a formaldehyde-inactivated SARS-CoV-2 vaccine (FIV), formulated in

99

Alhydrogel. In this study design we aim to induce a suboptimal immune response

100

which may promote VED, immunised animals are challenged with SARS-CoV-2 14

101

days after vaccination. Clinical signs, viral shedding and pathology are monitored

102

following challenge, and immune responses characterised before and after infection.

103

No enhanced pathology is observed in either species except for transient enhanced

104

pathology at 7 days post infection in ferrets and we present a possible mechanism

105

for suboptimal immunity induced by formaldehyde-inactivated SARS-CoV-2 spike.

Materials & Methods

108

Viruses and cells. SARS-CoV-2 Victoria/01/202026 was provided by The Doherty

109

Institute, Melbourne, Australia at P1 and passaged twice in Vero/hSLAM cells [ECACC

110

04091501]. Briefly, confluent monolayers of hSLAM cells were infected at a multiplicity

111

of infection (MOI) of approximately 0.0005 for 60 min in medium (see below) containing

112

no FBS at 37°C. The flasks were then filled with media supplemented with 4% heat-

113

inactivated FBS. Virus was harvested at 72 h post-infection by removal of any remaining

114

attached cells with sterile 5 mm borosilicate glass beads, clarification of the cell/media

115

supernatant by centrifugation at 1000 x g for 10 min, followed by dispensing and storage

116

at ≥-65°C. Whole genome sequencing was performed, on the challenge isolate, using

117

both Nanopore and Illumina as described previously24. Virus titre was determined by

118

plaque assay on Vero/E6 cells [ECACC 85020206]. Cell cultures were maintained at

119

37oC in MEM (Life Technologies, California, USA) supplemented with 10% foetal

120

bovine serum (FBS, Sigma, Dorset, UK) and 25mM HEPES (Life Technologies). All

121

Vero/hSLAM cell cultures were also supplemented with 0.4 μg/ml Geneticin (Gibco).

122
123

Preparation of formalin-inactivated virus vaccine (FIV). Centrifugal concentrators

124

(VivaSpin20; 300kDa cut off) were sterilised with 20 mL of 70% ethanol for 10 min

125

followed by a wash with 20mL of Dulbecco’s PBS (Gibco). To reduce the concentration

126

of calf serum components in the material, concentrators were loaded with 120mL of

127

SARS-CoV-2 at a titre of 8.45 x 106 pfu/mL and centrifuged at 3000 x g for 60 – 80

128

min (until the retained volume was ≤ 2mL); the concentrators were re-filled with 20mL

129

of DPBS and centrifugation repeated for a total of three washes. After the final wash,

130

the material was pooled and made up to 30mL in sterile DPBS. Methanol-free

131

formaldehyde solution at 36% (w/v) was added to a final formaldehyde concentration

132

of 0.02% at room temperature for 72 h. The inactivated virus was subjected to a further

133

three 20mL DPBS washes to remove the residual formaldehyde, made up to 20mL in

134

DPBS and aliquoted and stored below -15°C. To confirm inactivation, virus was

135

seeded onto Vero/hSLAM cells in three flasks (100μl/flask) which were serially

136

passaged for a total of 27 days. Microscopic examination for signs of cytopathic effect

137

(CPE) and RTqPCR were used to confirm no viable virus remained.

142

(ThermoFisher) ladder was loaded as a marker and gels were stained with SimplyBlue

143

SafeStain (ThermoFisher). Western Blot: Samples were processed as described for

144

SDS PAGE and transferred to PVDF membrane with iBlot2 (ThermoFisher). After

145

transfer, membranes were washed with tris-buffered saline 0.1% Tween20 (TBST) for

146

5 min at room temperature, followed by 1 h in blocking buffer (TBST, 5% skimmed

147

milk powder). Membranes were washed three times for 5 min with TBST. MERS

148

convalescent neutralising serum (NIBSC S3) was diluted 1:1000 in blocking buffer and

149

incubated for 1 h at room temperature and then at 4°C overnight. Membranes were

150

washed three times for 5 min with TBST and then incubated with either anti-human

151

IgG-AP or anti-rabbit IgG-AP (1:5000 in blocking buffer) for 1 h with agitation.

152

Membranes were washed three times as above and then developed with BCIP/NBT

153

liquid substrate system (Sigma-Aldrich). The protein concentration of the FIV was

154

determined using a BCA assay (Pierce #23227) (859μg/mL). Densitometry analysis

155

(ImageQuant TL; GE Healthcare) of the Western blot revealed a band of

156

approximately 180 kDa that was only present in wild-type virus and FIV preparations.

157

The relative density of this band (20.7%) permitted estimation of the proportion of the

158

FIV total protein that was Coronavirus-specific (178µg/mL).

Transmission electron microscopy. Live virus was inactivated and fixed with final

161

concentrations of 4%(w/v) formaldehyde and 2.5%(w/v) glutaraldehyde at ambient

162

temperature for >16 h prior to processing. Inactivated virus was processed without any

163

additional fixation steps. Samples (approximately 10µL) were placed directly on to

164

electron microscopy grids (400 mesh copper grid, covered with a carbon reinforced

165

plastic film). After 5 min adsorption the sample was removed, and the grids were

166

negatively stained using 2% methylamine tungstate. The grids were examined using

Animals. Ferrets: Ten healthy, female ferrets (Mustela putorius furo) aged 5-7

171

months were obtained from a UK Home Office accredited supplier (Highgate Farm,

172

UK). The mean weight at the time of challenge was 1002g/ferret (range 871-1150g).

173

Animals were housed as described previously24.

174

Rhesus macaques: Twelve rhesus macaques of Indian origin (Macaca mulatta) were

175

used in the study. Study groups comprised three males and three females and all were

176

adults aged 2-4 years and weighing between 3.73 and 5.52 kg at the time of challenge.

177

Animals were housed as described previously25. All experimental work was conducted

178

under the authority of a UK Home Office approved project licence that had been

179

subject to local ethical review at PHE Porton Down by the Animal Welfare and Ethical

180

Review Body (AWERB).

181
182

Vaccinations. Animals were randomly assigned to control (Ad-GFP for ferrets, no

183

vaccine for rhesus macaques) and FIV-vaccinated groups. The weight distribution of

184

the ferrets was tested to ensure there was no difference between groups (t-test, p>

185

0.05). An identifier chip (Bio-Thermo Identichip, Animalcare Ltd, UK) was inserted

186

subcutaneously into the dorsal cervical region of each animal. Macaques were

187

stratified for sex and into socially compatible cohorts and then randomly assigned into

188

treatment groups. FIV was diluted in PBS to 133μg/mL Coronavirus-specific protein

189

and mixed 1:1 in 2% Alhydrogel (Invivogen vac-alu-250) to give a final concentration

190

of 66.7μg/mL in 1% Alhydrogel. Ferrets were immunised with a single intramuscular

SARS-CoV-2 challenge. Prior to challenge ferrets were sedated by intramuscular

200

injection of ketamine/xylazine (17.9 mg/kg and 3.6 mg/kg bodyweight) and macaques

201

with ketamine hydrochloride (Ketaset, 100mg/ml, Fort Dodge Animal Health Ltd., UK;

202

10mg/kg). SARS-CoV-2 Victoria/01/202026 was prepared as described previously24. It

203

was delivered to ferrets by intranasal instillation (1.0mL total, 0.5mL per nostril) diluted

204

in PBS. A single dose of virus (5x106 pfu/ferret) was delivered to Ad-GFP- (n=4) and

205

FIV- (n=6) vaccinated ferrets. Macaques were challenged with 5 x 106 delivered by the

206

intratracheal route (2ml) and intranasal instillation (1ml total, 0.5ml per nostril). The

207

schedule of euthanisation and sampling is shown in Table 1.

208

Nasal washes were obtained by flushing the nasal cavity with 2mL PBS. Throat swabs

209

were collected using a standard swab (Sigma Virocult®) gently stroked across the back

210

of the pharynx in the tonsillar area. Throat swabs were processed, and aliquots stored

211

in viral transport media (VTM) and AVL at ≤ -60°C until assay. Clinical signs of disease

SARS-CoV-2 virology. RNA was isolated from nasal wash and throat swabs.

216

Samples were inactivated in AVL (Qiagen) and ethanol. Downstream extraction was

217

then performed using the BioSprint™96 One-For-All vet kit (Indical) and Kingfisher

218

Flex platform as per manufacturer’s instructions.

219

Reverse transcription-quantitative polymerase chain reaction (RT-qPCR) targeting a

220

region of the SARS-CoV-2 nucleocapsid (N) gene was used to determine viral loads

221

and was performed using TaqPath™ 1-Step RT-qPCR Master Mix, CG (Applied

222

Biosystems™), 2019-nCoV CDC RUO Kit (Integrated DNA Technologies) and

223

QuantStudio™ 7 Flex Real-Time PCR System. Sequences of the N1 primers and

224

probe were: 2019-nCoV_N1-forward, 5’ GACCCCAAAATCAGCGAAAT 3’; 2019-

225

nCoV_N1-reverse, 5’ TCTGGTTACTGCCAGTTGAATCTG 3’; 2019-nCoV_N1-probe,

226

5’ FAM-ACCCCGCATTACGTTTGGTGGACC-BHQ1 3’. The cycling conditions were:

227

25°C for 2 min, 50°C for 15 min, 95°C for 2 min, followed by 45 cycles of 95°C for 3 s,

228

55°C for 30 s. The quantification standard was in vitro transcribed RNA of the SARS-

229

CoV-2 N ORF (accession number NC_045512.2) with quantification between 1 x 10 1

230

and 1 x 106 copies/µL. Positive samples detected below the limit of quantification were

231

assigned the value of 5 copies/µL, whilst undetected samples were assigned the value

232

of 2.3 copies/µL, equivalent to the assay’s lower limit of detection.

242

µl per well of 2µg/mL Spike trimer, RBD or N in 1x PBS (Gibco) and incubated

243

overnight at 4°C. The ELISA plates were washed five times with wash buffer (PBS

244

0.05% Tween 20) and blocked with 100 µL/well 5% FBS (Sigma, F9665) in PBS 0.1%

245

Tween 20 for 1 h at room temperature. After washing, serum samples were serially

246

diluted in 10% FBS in PBS 0.1% Tween 20 and 50 µl/well of each dilution was added

247

to the antigen coated plate and incubated for 2 h at room temperature. Following

248

washing, anti-ferret IgG-HRP (Novus Biologics, NB7224) diluted (1/1000) or anti-

mononuclear cells (PBMCs) and splenocytes. The spleens were dissected into small

264

pieces. Dissected spleen was dissociated using a gentleMACS. The tissue solution

265

was passed through two cell sieves (100µm then 70µm) and then layered with Ficoll®-

266

Paque Premium (GE Healthcare, Hatfield, United Kingdom). Density gradient

267

centrifugation was carried out at 400g for 30 min on dissociated tissue and on whole

268

blood. Buffy coats containing lymphocytes were collected and washed with medium

269

by pelleting cells via centrifugation at 400 g for 10 min. The cells were counted using

270

a vial-1 cassette and a Nucleocounter-200 before cryopreservation in 95% FCS/5%

271

v/v DMSO. Cryopreserved cells were then frozen at -80°C in controlled rate freezer

272

containers overnight, before transfer to liquid nitrogen (vapour phase).

Immunophenotyping. Whole blood immunophenotyping assays were performed

277

using 50 µl of heparinised blood incubated for 30 min at room temperature with optimal

278

dilutions of the following antibodies: anti-CD3-AF700, anti-CD4-APC-H7, anti-CD8-

283

prepared in brilliant stain buffer (BD Biosciences). Red blood cell contamination was

284

removed using a Cal-lyse reagent kit as per the manufacturer’s instructions

287

cells and beads were fixed in a final concentration of 4% paraformaldehyde solution

288

(Sigma Aldrich, Gillingham, UK) prior to flow cytometric acquisition.

289
290

Cells were analysed using a five laser LSRII Fortessa instrument (BD Biosciences)

291

and data were analysed using FlowJo (version 10, Treestar, Ashland, US).

292

Immediately prior to flow cytometric acquisition, 50 µl of Truecount bead solution

293

(Beckman Coulter) was added to each sample. Leukocyte populations were identified

294

using a forward scatter-height (FSC-H) versus side scatter-area (SSC-A) dot plot to

295

identify the lymphocyte, monocyte and granulocyte populations, to which appropriate

296

gating strategies were applied to exclude doublet events and non-viable cells.

297

Lymphocyte sub populations including T-cells, NK-cells, NKT-cells and B-cells were

298

delineated by the expression pattern of CD3, CD20, CD95, CD4, CD8, CD127, CD25,

299

CD16 and the activation and inhibitory markers HLA-DR and PD-1. GraphPad Prism

Histopathology. The following samples from each ferret were fixed in 10% neutral-

303

buffered formalin, processed to paraffin wax and 4 µm thick sections cut and stained

304

with haematoxylin and eosin (HE); respiratory tract (left cranial and caudal lung

305

lobes; 3 sections from each lung lobe: proximal, medial and distal to the primary

306

lobar bronchus), trachea (upper and lower), larynx, tonsil, liver, kidney, spleen,

307

mediastinal lymph node, and small (duodenum) and large intestine (colon). Nasal

308

cavity samples were also taken and decalcified in an EDTA solution for 3 weeks

309

before embedding. These tissues above were examined by light microscopy and

310

evaluated subjectively. Three qualified veterinary pathologists examined the tissues

311

independently and were blinded to treatment and group details and the slides

312

randomised prior to examination in order to prevent bias. A semiquantitative scoring

313

system was developed to compare the severity of the lung lesions for each individual

314

animal and among groups. This scoring system was applied independently to the

315

cranial and caudal lung lobe tissue sections using the following parameters: a)

316

bronchial inflammation with presence of exudates and/or inflammatory cell

317

infiltration; b) bronchiolar inflammation with presence of exudates and/or

318

inflammatory cell infiltration; c) perivascular inflammatory infiltrates (cuffing); and d)

319

infiltration of alveolar walls and spaces by inflammatory cells, mainly mononuclear.

320

The severity of the histopathological lesions was scored as: 0=none (within normal

321

limits), 1=minimal, 2=mild, 3=moderate, and 4=severe.

322

Tissue sections of both lung lobes, nasal cavity and gastrointestinal tract from animals

323

culled at the early timepoint (day 6/7 post-challenge) were stained using the

324

RNAscope in situ hybridisation (ISH) technique to identify SARS-CoV-2 RNA. Briefly,

325

tissues were pre-treated with hydrogen peroxide for 10 min (room temperature), target

326

retrieval for 15 min (98-101°C) and protease plus for 30 mins (40°C) (Advanced Cell

327

Diagnostics). A V-nCoV2019-S probe (Cat No. 848561, Advanced Cell Diagnostics)

328

was incubated on the tissues for 2 h at 40°C. Amplification of the signal was carried

329

out following the RNAscope protocol using the RNAscope 2.5 HD Detection kit – Red

330

(Advanced Cell Diagnostics).

331

In addition, immunohistochemistry was used to identify T cells (CD3 +) in lung tissue

332

sections. Samples were cut at 4µm onto adhesive slides and stained using the Leica

333

Bond RxM (Leica Biosystems, Germany). Briefly, slides were dewaxed and treated

334

with peroxide block for 5 min. Epitope retrieval was performed using Epitope Retrieval

335

solution 2 (Leica Biosystems, Germany) for 20 min. A polyclonal rabbit anti-human

336

CD3 antibody (1:200; Agilent Technologies Inc, CA) was applied for 15 min and used

337

with Leica Polymer Refine Detection kit to complete the staining.

338

The following samples from each rhesus macaque were fixed, processed, cut and

339

stained as described above: left cranial and caudal lung lobes, trachea, larynx,

340

mediastinal lymph node, tonsil, spleen, liver, kidney, duodenum and colon.

341
342

For the lung, three sections from each left lung lobe were sampled from different

343

locations: proximal, medial and distal to the primary lobar bronchus. A scoring system

344

was used to evaluate objectively the histopathological lesions observed in the lung

345

tissue sections25. The scores for each histopathological parameter were calculated as

346

the average of the scores observed in the six lung tissue sections evaluated per

347

animal.

348

Sections from the lung lobes, duodenum and colon were stained with RNAScope ISH

349

as described above. For the lung sections, digital image analysis was carried out with

350

Nikon NIS-Ar software in order to calculate the total area of the lung section positive

351

for viral RNA.

displayed as an 11 cm field of view. To facilitate full examination of the cardiac and

361

pulmonary vasculature, lymph nodes and extrapulmonary tissues, Niopam 300

362

(Bracco, Milan, Italy), a non-ionic, iodinated contrast medium, was administered

363

intravenously (IV) at 2 ml/kg body weight and scans were collected immediately after

364

injection and ninety seconds from the mid-point of injection.

365

Scans were evaluated by a medical radiologist expert in respiratory diseases,

366

including in non-human primates30, blinded to the animal’s clinical status, for the

367

presence of: disease features characteristic of COVID-19 in humans (ground glass

368

opacity (GGO), consolidation, crazy paving, nodules, peri-lobular consolidation;

369

distribution: upper, middle, lower, central 2/3, bronchocentric); pulmonary embolus

372

CT Score system. To provide the power to discriminate differences between

373

individual NHP’s with low disease volume (i.e. <25% lung involvement), a score

374

system was applied in which scores were attributed for possession of abnormal

375

features characteristic of COVID in human patients (COVID pattern score) and for the

376

distribution of features through the lung (Zone score). The COVID pattern score was

377

calculated as sum of scores assigned for the number of nodules identified, and the

378

possession and extent of GGO and consolidation according to the following system:

379

Nodule(s): Score 1 for 1, 2 for 2 or 3, 3 for 4 or more; GGO: each affected area was

380

attributed with a score according to the following: Score 1 if area measured < 1 cm, 2

381

if 1 to 2 cm, 3 if 2 -3 cm, 4 if > 3 cm and scores for each area of GGO were summed

382

to provide a total GGO score; Consolidation: each affected area was attributed with a

383

score according to the following: 1 if area measured < 1 cm, 2 if 1 to 2 cm, 3 if 2 -3

384

cm, 4 if > 3 cm. Scores for each area of consolidation are summed to provide a total

385

consolidation score. To account for estimated additional disease impact on the host of

386

consolidation compared to GGO, the score system was weighted by doubling the

387

score assigned for consolidation. To determine the zone score, the lung was divided

388

into 12 zones and each side of the lung divided (from top to bottom) into three zones:

389

the upper zone (above the carina), the middle zone (from the carina to the inferior

390

pulmonary vein), and the lower zone (below the inferior pulmonary vein). Each zone

391

was further divided into two areas: the anterior area (the area before the vertical line

392

of the midpoint of the diaphragm in the sagittal position) and the posterior area (the

393

area after the vertical line of the mid-point of the diaphragm in the sagittal position).

394

This results in 12 zones in total where a score of one is attributed to each zone

395

containing structural changes. The COVID pattern score and the zone are summed to

396

provide the Total CT score.

Absolute Antibody Inc, and RBD-binding mAbs CR302232 and EY6A333 were obtained

410

from T. Tan and K-Y. Huang respectively, and were biotinylated using NHS-LC-biotin

411

following manufacturer’s instructions (ThermoFisher).

412

For S trimer capture ELISA, high protein binding ELISA plates (PerkinElmer) were

413

coated overnight at 4oC with anti-myc antibody 9E10 at 4 µg/mL. After washing and

414

blocking in PBS/2% BSA/0.05% tween 20, S trimer at 1 µg/mL was added in 50µL/well

415

in PBS/1% BSA/0.05% tween 20 (ELISA buffer, EB) for 2 h at room temperature. For

416

RBD capture ELISA, high protein binding ELISA plates (PerkinElmer) were coated

417

overnight at 4oC with rabbit anti-human IgG (Jackson Laboratories) at 5 µg/mL in PBS.

418

After washing and blocking, RBD-Fc at 1 µg/mL was added in 50µL/well in EB for 2h

419

at room temperature. After washing, wells requiring formaldehyde (FA) treatment were

420

incubated with 50µL 0.02% methanol-free formaldehyde (ThermoFisher Scientific) in

Results

436

Characterisation of formaldehyde-inactivated vaccine (FIV). Transmission

437

electron microscopy (Fig. 1) showed that the washing and formaldehyde inactivation

438

procedure resulted in virus particles that appeared similar to typical coronavirus

439

morphology with a complete ring of peplomers/spikes on each particle (Fig. 1A and

440

B). SDS-PAGE analysis (Supplementary Figure 1A) shows that the majority of protein

441

bands seen in the medium only (lane 2) are also seen in the live wild-type virus (lane3)

442

and the FIV (lane 4), indicating that these proteins are likely to be components of the

443

culture medium, including FBS and host cell proteins. The medium-only protein

444

species are visibly reduced in intensity following washing using the centrifugal

445

concentrator in the FIV even though this was six-fold concentrated. Notably, protein

446

species in the 62 to 100kDa range were almost absent in FIV. The Western blot

447

analysis (Supplementary Figure 1B and 1C) confirms that both wild-type live virus

448

and FIV react with antibodies to both SARS-CoV-2 spike-RBD and nucleocapsid.

449

Western blot with NIBSC, SARS-CoV-2 neutralising, MERS convalescent serum (S3)

450

standard has limited reactivity with proteins found in the medium (Supplementary

451

Figure 1B). However, a virus-specific band corresponding to the spike-RBD band on

452

the specific antisera blot is detected at approximately 160kDa in unwashed virus

453

preparation and at 180kDa in FIV with the increase molecular weight likely to be a

454

consequence of formaldehyde-fixation cross linking this protein.

SARS-CoV-2 infection in control and FIV-vaccinated ferrets. Ferrets vaccinated

457

with either a recombinant adenovirus expressing GFP (Ad-GFP) or FIV were

458

challenged intranasally with 1mL of Victoria/1/2020 SARS-CoV-2 at 5 x 106 PFU26.

459

The sampling schedule is shown in Table 1. The high titre stock of challenge virus

460

was prepared (passage 3), and quality control sequencing showed it was identical to

461

the original stock received from the Doherty Institute and did not contain a commonly

462

reported 8 amino acid deletion in the furin cleavage site 34. Both groups displayed

463

similar viral genome copies in nasal wash samples which continued to be detected

464

until the end of the experiment at day 15 pc (Fig. 2A). Similar to previous studies24

465

the peak in viral RNA shedding was seen between day 2 and 4 pc for all ferrets in

466

both groups. The majority of virus detected in nasal wash occurred between

467

challenge and day 8 pc. Interestingly, viral RNA detected in nasal wash and throat

468

swab samples was also shown to be approximately 3-fold higher in the FIV group at

469

day 2 pc. A similar trend was seen in both groups during the first week after

470

challenge although the RNA genome copies measured were substantially lower in

471

the throat swab than in the nasal wash samples (Fig. 2B). Overall, there were no

472

significant differences between groups in virus shedding from either the nose or

473

throat. Neither group of animals showed weight loss due to the infection

474

(Supplementary Fig. 2). The apparent difference in weight gain in the FIV-

475

vaccinated group was due to the necropsy-sampling of the two lightest animals from

476

this group on day 7. No fever was seen at any time in either group of ferrets post

477

infection (Supplementary Fig. 2).

resolution of SARS-CoV-2 infection. The lung histopathology scores for individual

482

Ad-GFP- and FIV-vaccinated ferrets are shown in the heat map in Fig 3A. Samples

483

were obtained from 2 animals from each group early in the infection (Ad-GFP at day

484

6 pc and FIV at day 7 pc). The remaining animals were euthanised at days 13-14 pc

485

(Ad-GFP) and day 15 pc (FIV). All assessments, including bronchiolar, bronchial and

486

interstitial infiltrates together with perivascular cuffing, were scored as minimal or

487

mild in the Ad-GFP-vaccinated animals with a greater number of mild or moderate

488

scores in the FIV-vaccinated ferrets at the early time point (6/7 days pc). One animal

489

from the Ad-GFP group showed mild lesions compatible with acute bronchiolitis and

490

perivascular/peribronchiolar cuffing (Fig. 3F,G). The other animal from this group

491

showed only occasional minimal bronchiolar infiltrates. Both animals from the FIV

492

group at 7 days pc showed more remarkable changes, with mild to moderate

493

bronchiolitis (infiltrates within the bronchioles and occasionally bronchi) and

494

inflammatory foci within the parenchyma (Fig. 3B). Moreover, perivascular cuffing

495

was observed frequently (Fig. 3C), with the infiltrates being mostly mononuclear

496

cells, including CD3+ T lymphocytes identified by immunohistochemistry (IHC)

497

staining (Fig. 3D). Occasionally, neutrophils and eosinophils were also present (Fig.

498

3C, insert). The cuffing also affected numerous airways (Fig. 3C). Due to the small

499

numbers of animals, the differences in scores observed between FIV and Ad-GFP-

500

vaccinated groups did not reach significance.

501

In contrast, at 13-15 days pc, the lesions observed were minimal to mild with no

502

obvious differences between groups (Fig. 3A).

503

RNAScope ISH technique was used to detect viral RNA in lung and nasal cavity tissue

504

sections. Only very few occasional scattered cells were found positive to viral RNA in

505

the lung at day 6/7, which were within the alveolar walls and not related to the presence

506

of lesions. No differences were observed between groups. Viral RNA was also found

507

only as small foci of positive cells (epithelial and or sustentacular) within the olfactory

508

and respiratory mucosa in only one animal from the Ad-GFP group at day 6 pc (Fig.

509

3H).

510

No obvious lesions were observed in any other organ except for the liver, which

511

showed a variable degree of multifocal hepatitis, mild to moderate in all animals (Fig

512

3E, I).

513
514

Immune responses to FIV in ferrets. Ad-GFP-vaccinated animals showed no

515

immune responses before SARS-CoV-2 challenge (Fig 4). FIV-vaccinated animals

516

produced significant increases in IgG after vaccination against SARS-CoV-2 spike and

517

spike receptor binding domain (RBD). The response to nucleoprotein (N) was not

518

significant. Modest rises (GMT=89, p=0.002) in neutralising antibody titres were seen

519

in sera from the FIV-vaccinated animals with a rapid rise in neutralising antibody titres

520

after challenge indicating immune priming by the FIV. At termination, the GM titres for

521

FIV-vaccinated animals were 5356 and 453 for the two remaining Ad-GFP-vaccinated

522

animals. ELISpot assays applied to splenocytes isolated on day 6 pc (Ad-GFP-

523

vaccinated) or day 7 pc (FIV-vaccinated) show that animals vaccinated with FIV made

524

more pronounced responses to whole live virus, membrane, and nucleocapsid peptide

525

pools with both groups showing similar low responses to virus spike peptides

526

(Supplementary Fig. 3A). This early interferon gamma response post-infection is

527

consistent with an anamnestic response in the FIV-vaccinated animals following

528

priming with viral antigens. The lack of cellular immune response to spike is interesting

and might indicate that FIV promotes a skewed immune response. Responses

530

measured in PBMCs were much lower than those seen in splenocytes.

SARS-CoV-2 infection in control and FIV-vaccinated rhesus macaques.

533

Following infection with 5 x 106 PFU Victoria/1/2020 SARS-CoV-2 given in 2ml by the

534

intratracheal route and 1ml intranasally, viral RNA was quantified in nasal wash and

535

throat swab samples. Viral RNA was detected in both samples during the experiment

536

with peak values detected by day three and a decline thereafter (Fig5A and B). There

537

was no difference between viral copies detected in macaques that received FIV or no

538

vaccine. Bronchioalveolar lavage (BAL) was obtained on necropsy at day 7 and lower

539

geometric mean viral RNA copies per ml (p=0.168) were measured in macaques that

540

received FIV than no vaccine controls (Fig 4C). No significant changes in body

541

temperature (Supplementary Fig. 2C) where observed. Slight weight loss was

542

observed in both groups (Supplementary Fig. 2D), but no adverse clinical signs were

543

recorded for any macaque despite frequent monitoring during the study period.

544

Images from CT scans collected five days after challenge were examined by an

545

expert thoracic radiologist with experience of non-human primate prior CT

546

interpretation and human COVID-19 CT features, blinded to the clinical status.

547

Pulmonary abnormalities that involved less than 25% of the lung and reflected those

548

characteristics of SARS-CoV-2 infection in humans were identified in three of the FIV

549

group and five of the unvaccinated group. Where reported, disease was

550

predominantly bilateral (two of three FIV, five of six unvaccinated) with a similar

551

peripheral distribution through the lung lobes reported in the FIV vaccinated and

552

showing abnormal lung structure, with the exception of one FIV-vaccinated animal in

554

which consolidation was identified. Other features characteristic of human COVID

555

(reverse halo, perilobular, nodules, pulmonary embolus) were not observed in any of

556

the macaques in either group. Evaluation of pulmonary disease burden using a

557

scoring system designed to discriminate differences between individual macaques

558

with low disease volume revealed a non-significant trend (p = 0.1364) for a reduction

559

in the total CT score in the FIV group compared to the scores attributed to macaques

560

in the unvaccinated group (Fig. 6D). Similarly, the FIV vaccine reduced both the

561

amount of abnormalities induced (pattern score) and distribution of disease (zone

562

score) (Supplementary Fig. 4 H and I).

563

Pathology following SARS-CoV-2 infection in rhesus macaques. Pathological

564

changes were found in the lungs of all SARS-CoV-2-infected macaques and consisted

565

of multiple areas of mild to moderate bronchiolo-alveolar necrosis, inflammatory cell

566

infiltration and type II pneumocyte proliferation. Mild perivascular and peribronchiolar

567

cuffing was also observed. The lung pathology scores for individual macaques are

568

shown in Fig. 6 and with milder pathological changes observed in the FIV-vaccinated

569

macaques. The total pathology score for the no vaccine group was greater than the

570

FIV group (Fig. 6B, p=0.013). RNAScope analysis of the percentage of area positively

571

stained for SARS-CoV-2 RNA showed a greater lung area infected in the no vaccine

572

group than FIV-vaccinated macaques (Fig. 6C, p = 0.0238).

573

Immune responses to FIV in rhesus macaques. Serum from control macaques

574

obtained on the day of challenge did not show any N, RBD or S-specific IgG but rises

575

in RBD and S-specific IgG were detected in serum from the FIV-vaccinated macaques

576

(Fig. 7). FIV-vaccinated animals also showed a rise in neutralising antibody titre on the

577

day of challenge (p=0.0287). Both groups showed a rise in neutralising antibody titre

578

7 days following challenge (Fig. 7). Similarly, on the day of challenge, a higher

579

frequency of spike-specific IFNγ-secreting cells was measured by ELISPOT assay in

580

the FIV group compared to that determined in the unvaccinated group suggesting the

581

induction of a modest but significant (p = 0.0433) SARS-CoV-2-specific cellular

582

response (Supplementary. Figure 3B). The trend reversed six to eight days after

583

challenge when frequencies were assessed at the end of the study, with higher

584

frequencies of spike-specific IFNγ-secreting cells measured in the unvaccinated group

585

compared to the FIV group in both PBMC and spleen cells.

586

Immunophenotyping flow cytometry assays were applied to whole blood samples

587

collected immediately prior to and 14 days after FIV vaccination, as well as at days

588

three and seven after SARS-CoV-2 challenge to explore potential vaccine-induced

589

changes in the cellular immune compartment that might influence the course of the

590

immune response following infection (Sup figure 3). CD4 and CD8 T-cells expressing

591

the immune checkpoint signalling receptor PD-1 increased significantly following FIV

592

vaccination (p = 0.03), with further significant increases observed in PD-1 expressing

593

CD4 T-cell populations following SARS-CoV2 infection in both FIV vaccinated and

594

unvaccinated groups (both p = 0.03) (SF3 D). Similarly, FIV vaccination led to a

595

significant increase in CD4 regulatory T-cells expressing CD25 and CD127 (SP3 E),

596

indicating that alongside the proinflammatory cellular response evident in the antigen-

597

specific IFNγ ELISPOT profiles, FIV vaccination also induced T-cell populations with

598

a more tolerogenic phenotype.

Effects of formaldehyde on SARS-CoV-2 spike. Formaldehyde treatment of SARS-

600

CoV-2 virus will cross link viral proteins, of which the S glycoprotein trimer is the target

of most neutralising antibodies. Cross-linking of S may modify its antigenicity,

602

potentially altering elicitation of neutralising antibodies. To analyse the effects of

603

formaldehyde on the S trimer and the isolated receptor binding domain (RBD), soluble

604

antigens were captured onto ELISA plates using either anti-Myc tag (S-Myc) or anti-

605

Fc (RBD-Fc) respectively to maintain their native conformation, and treated or not with

606

formaldehyde using the same protocol as for inactivation of whole virus: 0.02% for 72

607

h at room temperature. Samples were then tested for binding of RBD ligands, either

608

soluble (s)ACE2-Fc or the RBD binding monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) CR3022 and

609

EY6A which interact with RBD surfaces non-overlapping the ACE2 binding site.

610

Binding curves revealed that ligands binding to formaldehyde-treated S protein gave

611

substantially lower maximum binding than that to the untreated S counterpart (Fig.

612

8A). Area under the curve (AUC) analysis revealed that binding was significantly

613

reduced for sACE2-Fc and CR3022, and had a trend to reduction for EY6A (Fig. 8B).

614

Interestingly, the reduction for sACE2 and CR3022 was almost precisely 2-fold,

615

suggesting either that the formaldehyde treatment had reduced the binding activity of

616

a subset of RBD domains, or that half of the formaldehyde-treated S trimers were in a

617

non-RBD available conformation. To differentiate between these two possibilities, we

618

tested binding directly to the isolated untreated or formaldehyde-treated RBD (Fig.

619

8C). Strikingly, formaldehyde treatment had no effect on RBD-ligand binding, with

620

AUC analysis showing near identical values for formaldehyde-treated and untreated

621

RBD (Fig. 8D). It therefore seems most likely that formaldehyde treatment is stabilising

622

a population of S trimers in the ‘RBD down’ conformation which would be unable to

623

engage ACE2. Indeed, recent cryo-EM structures imply that the S trimer is 50% one

624

RBD up and 50% all RBD down at equilibrium 35. Therefore, cross-linking of a

625

population of trimers would most likely fix this 1:1 equilibrium, allowing only half of the

626

trimers to expose the one-up RBD. By contrast, untreated S trimer would be free to

627

sample both conformations, allowing progressive ACE2 occupancy to maximum of the

26

628

one RBD-up trimer conformation over time. This would explain the 2-fold decrease in

629

occupancy of formaldehyde-treated S trimers shown above. To further interrogate this,

630

we modelled the location of lysine and arginine residues, the side chains of which are

631

targets for formaldehyde attack, in the S trimer and RBD structures. Fig. 6E focuses

632

on the location of lysines and arginines in the RBD-down S trimer, revealing a large

633

number proximal to the RBD-trimer interface that might be cross-linked to prevent RBD

634

movement. Fig. 6F shows that whilst there are lysine and arginine residues proximal

635

to the RBD-ACE2 binding interface (green), there are none within the interface,

636

implying that formaldehyde treatment would not directly affect RBD-ACE2 binding.

637

This modelling is therefore consistent with the idea that formaldehyde cross-linking will

638

lock 50% of trimers into the all RBD-down state, reducing access of the RBD to ligand

639

binding and B cell recognition. Such modified antigenicity would probably translate into

640

reduced RBD immunogenicity, reducing antibody production against this neutralising

641

antibody-eliciting surface.

643

Discussion

644

Rapid development of vaccines to prevent COVID-19 disease is in progress2. Safety

645

is of primary importance for vaccines that are administered to healthy people. Thus

646

vaccines must be thoroughly assessed for reactogenicity and longer term safety 36,

647

but also to ensure they do not cause any enhancement of disease37. Vaccine-

648

enhanced disease (VED) which can be mediated by antibody-dependent

649

enhancement (ADE) have been described for respiratory virus vaccines. The

650

potential risks from COVID-19 vaccines have been described by Graham38.

651

Enhanced disease can potentially be mediated by antibodies that bind virus without

27

652

neutralising activity, which cause disease through increased viral replication, or via

653

formation of immune complexes that deposit in tissues and activate complement

654

pathways associated with inflammation12. T helper 2 cell (Th2)-biased immune

655

responses have also been associated with ineffective vaccines that can lead to

656

enhanced disease following infection39 40. In order to understand the risks of VED

657

caused by SARS-CoV-2 vaccines it will be of great benefit to produce a positive

658

control vaccine that enhances disease in an animal model following challenge so this

659

endpoint can be defined and the mechanisms can be understood and avoided in

660

vaccines prepared for human use.

661

As examples of VED have been observed following the use of a formaldehyde

662

inactivated vaccine, e.g. RSV41 and measles16, we have prepared a killed SARS-

663

CoV-2 vaccine by formaldehyde-fixation of the virus. Formaldehyde-fixed SARS-

664

CoV-1 vaccines have been shown to induce enhanced disease18 19 21 42 although the

665

mechanism for this is not understood. It has been suggested that non-viral

666

components of formaldehyde-inactivated preparations, such as cellular components

667

and debris or medium constituents may also play a role in enhanced disease. In a

668

cotton rat model of RSV VED, cell culture contaminants were a major driver of lung

669

pathology which was exacerbated by the formaldehyde-inactivated vaccine and

670

RSV challenge43. The SARS-CoV-2 FIV prepared in this study also contained cell

671

and medium components although the content was significantly reduced by washing

672

using a centrifugal concentrator. Another factor in the FIV vaccine design was to use

673

Alhydrogel as an adjuvant which is known to induce Th2-biased immune

674

responses44. In addition, as a sub-optimal immune response has been suggested to

675

be associated with VED14, we chose to challenge the ferrets and rhesus macaques

676

14 days after intramuscular delivery of a single dose of FIV.

677

The SARS-CoV-2 infection in the Ad-GFP- or FIV-vaccinated ferrets followed a

678

similar course to that observed in our previous study

679

between 2 and 4 days pc. It was interesting to note that higher viral loads were

680

detected in the upper respiratory tract of FIV-vaccinated animals at day 2 pc but after

681

this sampling time, very similar genome copy values were obtained. There were no

682

differences in temperature, weight (Supplementary figure 2) or any other clinical

683

signs between the two groups.

684

Consistent with the higher viral load at day 2, the lung histopathology from the two

685

FIV-vaccinated animals necropsied at day 7 was more severe than the two Ad-GFP-

686

vaccinated animals necropsied at day 6. The semiquantitative scoring system was

687

used to discriminate the severity of lesions between animals and groups. Even

688

though the number of animals was small, and although lung pathology was not

689

severe in any case, we observed some unique differences in the FIV-vaccinated

690

ferrets. At 6-7 days pc, a higher severity was observed in animals from the FIV group

691

(combined total score 24), compared to the Ad-GFP control (combined total score

692

10). This included eosinophilic infiltrate and perivascular cuffing that was not

693

observed in the control-vaccinated ferrets. The lung pathology in the ferret model24

694

was quite transient and thus at 13-15 days pc, whilst there was some individual

695

variability present, both groups showed mild pathology.

696

Multifocal mild to moderate hepatitis has also been described as a potential adverse

697

effect of SARS-CoV-1 vaccines45. However, these lesions are found as a

698

background finding for this species in many experimental studies, although viral

699

infections, systemic or in the gastrointestinal tract, have also been related to the

700

presence of these periportal inflammatory infiltrates46. Due to the variability in

701

severity and the fact that naïve ferrets frequently show some degree of hepatitis, the

702

interpretation of this lesion must be taken cautiously.

703

Following this observation of mild transient enhanced disease in the two FIV-

704

vaccinated ferrets culled at day 7, we have tested the same FIV in 6 macaques

705

along with 6 unvaccinated controls. We have previously compared the course of

706

SARS-CoV-2 infection in both rhesus and cynomolgus macaques and showed virus

707

replication in the upper and lower respiratory tract with pulmonary lesions resembling

708

mild COVID-19 in humans25. Macaques allow for a more detailed examination of

709

lung pathology using precise scoring system devised in our recent study. We also

710

have considerable experience of in life CT scanning of macaques47 30 25 which allows

711

further aspects of lung pathology to be characterised at time points before necropsy.

712

This detailed analysis has revealed no evidence of enhanced disease in macaques

713

at any time point, but rather that the FIV provided some protection against the mild-

714

to-moderate lung pathology observed in the unvaccinated control macaques.

715

The presence of inflammatory infiltrates, and particularly perivascular cuffing, has

716

been described as a feature potentially related to VED in SARS-CoV-1 preclinical

717

vaccine trials19 21 22. In our study these infiltrates were always of mild to moderate

718

severity.

719
720

Characterisation of the immune response to the FIV vaccine prior to challenge in both

721

species confirmed the expectation of modest immunity to SARS-CoV-2 spike. A

722

significant rise in anti-S IgG, but not anti-N IgG was detected by ELISA. The geometric

723

mean neutralising titre of 89 seen in ferrets and 61 in macaques was low compared to

724

that observed in primate studies with candidate vaccines10 8 7 11 and in clinical trials29

726

and macaques following challenge, compared to control animals indicated that priming

727

had been mediated by the FIV. The SARS-CoV-2-specific interferon γ response

728

measured in splenocytes using an ELISpot assay 6 or 7 days after challenge showed

729

a greater response in the FIV-vaccinated animals to live virus, membrane and

730

nucleocapsid peptide pools but very little response to the S protein pools, indicating a

731

poor cellular response to the S antigen with FIV. Conversely, spike peptide-specific

732

IFNγ SFU measured in macaques increased significantly following FIV vaccination

733

and evaluation of the spike-specific interferon-γ response in splenocytes and PBMC

734

collected from macaques at a similar time after SARS-CoV2 challenge revealed the

735

reverse pattern to that observed in ferrets, with greater responses measured in the

736

unvaccinated group relative to the FIV-vaccinated animals. This may reflect that

737

improved priming of the T-cell mediated response contributed to the protection

738

afforded by the FIV vaccine in this species if response magnitude is driven by antigenic

739

load following infection.

740

The expression of checkpoint inhibitory receptors is often considered a marker of T-

741

cell exhaustion, although more recently PD-1 signaling has also been linked to

742

improved effector T-cell priming and enhanced clearance of acute viral infections49.

743

Similarly, the induction of regulatory CD4 T-cells, and the inhibitory influence they

744

are likely to exert, may be considered counterproductive to vaccine induced

745

immunity. However, the increased frequency of T-regs observed following FIV

746

vaccination is likely to reflect the immune response typically induced by

747

coronaviruses in this species, as similar increases were also seen in the

748

unvaccinated animals early after SARS-CoV2 infection, and thus may help to explain

However, the larger rise in neutralising antibody titre in FIV-vaccinated ferrets

31

749

the relatively mild disease that develops in this species and the improved outcome

750

observed in FIV vaccine primed macaques50 51.

751

There are limitations to the current study, the principal of which is the small number

752

of ferrets in the early culled group. The transient nature of the pathology meant that

753

these differences resolved by the second necropsy time point.

754

Some insight into the weak anti-S neutralising response induced by the FIV was

755

gained using a capture ELISA which preserved the conformation of the S trimer on

756

the solid phase, unlike direct coating onto the ELISA plate which modified

757

antigenicity (data not shown), as has been observed for soluble forms of the HIV-1

758

envelope glycoprotein trimer52. Formaldehyde treatment of S trimer in this format

759

was the same as that used to inactivate the vaccine, allowing extrapolation of ligand

760

binding to the ELISA-captured formaldehyde-treated S trimer to that on the virus.

761

Formaldehyde cross-linking resulted in a 2-fold reduction in binding of ACE2-Fc and

762

two RBD-specific MAbs (CR3022 and EY6A) to formaldehyde-treated compared to

763

untreated S trimer. By contrast, formaldehyde treatment of recombinant RBD did not

764

affect binding of ACE2-Fc or these MAbs, implying that formaldehyde treatment

765

cross-linked a proportion of S trimer into a non-ligand binding conformation. These

766

results are consistent with the location of lysine and arginine residues, and suggest

767

that RBD exposure may be limited by cross-linking, reducing exposure of

768

neutralising antibody epitopes on the RBD. This result may be of more general

769

interest, since other viral envelope glycoproteins, such as those of HIV-1, are

770

metastable and sample different conformational states, some of which are more

771

relevant to neutralisation than others53. Cross-linking may trap these different

772

conformational states, modifying exposure of neutralising antibody epitopes to B cell

773

recognition54.

774

Formaldehyde inactivation has been widely used to prepare inactivated viral

775

vaccines55 and as a toxoiding agent for bacterial toxin vaccines. Some of the

776

considerations for inactivated SARS-CoV-2 vaccines are discussed in a recent

777

commentary56. The study reported here has confirmed that caution should be used if

778

formaldehyde is the inactivation reagent for COVID-19 vaccines. Several vaccines

779

are in development that use β-propiolactone as inactivation agent. One such vaccine

780

has been shown to be protective in rhesus macaques following SARS-CoV-2

781

challenge without induction of VED7. A preliminary report of phase 1 and 2 studies

782

with another β-propiolactone vaccine indicated that it is tolerated, safe and produced

783

neutralising antibodies in phase 1 and 2 studies48. In addition, the authors mention in

784

the discussion that enhancement of disease was not observed in primates following

785

SARS-CoV-2 challenge but no pathology results are presented.

786

In conclusion, we have prepared an experimental SARS-CoV-2 vaccine based on

787

previous inactivated virus studies that induced VED. We showed no evidence of

788

enhanced disease at later time points in ferrets or at any time in a more in-depth

789

analysis in rhesus macaques which included CT imaging. However, we did observe

790

increased pathology scores, early in the infection of FIV-vaccinated ferrets which

791

resolved by the later necropsy time point. It is reassuring that, even with a vaccine

792

deliberately designed to induce enhanced disease, no enhancement was seen apart

793

from at 7 days post infection in ferrets. Future studies to investigate the potential of

794

SARS-CoV-2 vaccines to cause enhanced disease should examine lung pathology

795

at multiple time points including soon after challenge. Formalin-inactivated virus can

796

be used as a suboptimal comparator to determine the potential of SARS-CoV-2

797

vaccine candidates to induce VED so that unsuitable vaccines are identified at an

798

early stage of development before significant clinical studies commence.

Fig. 8. Formaldehyde treatment reduces S trimer binding to ACE2.
A) Representative ELISA with S trimer captured onto the ELISA plate using anti-Myc
mAb 9E10, untreated or treated with formaldehyde (FA) for 72 h at room
temperature prior to addition of ligands at the concentrations shown and ligand
detection using anti-human Fc-HRP. B) Area Under the Curve (AUC) analysis was
used to determine the binding index, where 1=equivalent binding between untreated
and FA-treated S trimer, and 0=zero binding to formaldehyde-treated trimer. The red
line represents 50% binding. n=means of pooled data from 3 independent ELISAs,
