Abstract

38

In the twenty first century, we have witnessed three corona virus outbreaks; SARS in 2003, MERS

39

in 2012 and ongoing pandemic COVID-19. To prevent outbreaks by novel mutant strains, we need

40

broad-spectrum antiviral agents that are effective against wide array of coronaviruses. In this study,

41

we scientifically investigated potent food bioactive broad-spectrum antiviral compounds by

42

targeting Mpro and PLpro proteases of CoVs using in silico and in vitro approaches. The results

43

revealed that phycocyanobilin (PCB) showed potential inhibitor activity against both proteases.

44

PCB had best binding affinity to Mpro and PLpro with IC50 values of 71 µm and 62 µm, respectively.

45

In addition, in silico studies of Mpro and PLpro enzymes of other human and animal CoVs indicated

46

broad spectrum inhibitor activity of the PCB. Like PCB, other phycobilins such as phycourobilin

47

(PUB), Phycoerythrobilin (PEB) and Phycoviolobilin (PVB) showed similar binding affinity to

48

SARS-CoV-2 Mpro and PLpro.

1. Introduction
Coronaviruses (CoVs) belongs to the subfamily of Orthocoronavirinae, family Coronavidae,

62

order Nidovirales. They are large (average diameter of 120 nm), enveloped, positive-sense

63

single-stranded RNA viruses with genome size of ~26 to 32 kb (Woo et al., 2010). Based on

64

antigen cross reactivity and genetic makeup, there are four sub-groups (alpha, beta, gamma and

65

delta) which subdivided into 26 different species of coronaviruses (Cleri, Ricketti, & Vernaleo,

66

2010). CoVs cause diseases in mammals and birds, alpha and beta group CoVs are pathogenic to

67

humans (Paules, Marston, & Fauci, 2020). The seven CoVs that can cause infectious diseases in

68

humans are HCoV-229E, HCoV-NL63, HCoV-OC43, HCoV-HKU1, severe acute respiratory

69

syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV), Middle East respiratory virus coronavirus (MERS-CoV)

70

and 2019-nCoV (2019-novel coronavirus) or SARS-CoV-2 (Hamre & Procknow, 1966;

71

McIntosh, Becker, & Chanock, 1967; Van Der Hock et al., 2004; Woo et al., 2005; Drosten et

72

al., 2003; Bermingham et al., 2012; Wu et al., 2020). The first four common CoVs persistently

73

circulate in humans and responsible for 10 to 30 % of common colds (Paules, Marston, & Fauci,

74

2020). Other three are deadly viruses are etiological agents of fatal respiratory syndromes SARS,

75

MERS and coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) respectively. The SARS epidemic in 2003

76

ended with 8098 reported cases, 774 deaths (fatality rate 9.7 %), whereas MERS outbreak in

77

2012 caused 2494 reported cases, 858 deaths (fatality rate 34%) (WHO, 2003; Alfaraj et al.,

78

2019). The COVID-19, current pandemic outbreak first identified in2019, reported > 37.1

79

million confirmed cases with > 1.07 million deaths (fatality rate 2.9 %) as of 12 October 2020

80

(WHO, 2020). Avian infectious bronchitis virus (IBV), feline infectious peritonitis virus (FIPV),

81

canine CoV, and porcine transmissible gastroenteritis virus (TGEV) cause respiratory and enteric

82

diseases in farm and domestic pet animals (Cavanagh, 2007; Pederson, 2009; Pratelli, 2006;

83

Odend'hal, 1983).

84

Till now, there are no approved vaccines and therapeutic drugs for COVID-19 or other

85

human coronavirus infections, and lack of enough clinical trial data to make treatment decisions.

86

Although vaccines have been developed against animal viruses IBV, canine CoV, and TGEV to

87

help prevent serious diseases (Liu & Kong, 2004; Carmichael, 1999; Park et al., 1998), some

88

potential problems such as; recombination events between field and vaccine strains, emergence

89

of novel serotypes, and antibody-dependent enhancement remain. Currently, rapid development

90

of vaccines and repurposing of approved antivirals drugs (for e.g. remdesivir) are major clinical

91

approaches of pandemic preparedness plan. Development of broad-spectrum antiviral agents

92

which are effective against wide range of CoVs and other classes of viruses including emerging

93

ones could be a promising strategy (Fauci, 2006; Bekerman & Einav, 2015; Cho & Glenn, 2020).

94

Broad-spectrum antiviral targeting can be classified strategies into two categories; i) entry

95

inhibitors interact with existing virus particles outside of cells and prevent infection (Hangartner,

96

Zinkernagel, & Hengartner, 2006) and ii) replication inhibitors aimed at stopping viral genome

97

replication to curtail production of new virus particles (De Clerq, 2004). The S glycoprotein of

98

coronaviruses, the main determinant of host cell attachment and viral entry, is not well conserved

99

between HCoVs (Totura & Bavari, 2019). On the other hand, CoV nonstructural proteins (nsps)

100

are highly conserved components of the coronavirus lifecycle that mediate viral replication

101

(Totura & Bavari, 2019). Literature studies reported the following SARS‑CoV‑2 nsp targets;

102

Main Protease (Mpro), Papain-like protease (PLpro), Nsp3, RdRp, Helicase, Nsp14, Nsp15,

103

Nsp16, N protein to inhibit virus replication (Wu et al., 2020). Proteolytic processing of viral

104

polyproteins into functional nsps by two viral proteases, the Mpro and PLpro is an important event

105

of CoV lifecycle. The Mpro acts on minimum 11 cleavage sites of replicase 1ab, ~790 kDa; at

106

recognition sequence Leu-Gln↓(Ser, Ala, Gly) (↓ indicates cleavage site) for most cleavage

107

sites, block viral replication (Zhang et al., 2020). PLPro enzyme hydrolyses the peptide bond at

108

carboxyl side of glycine (P1 position) and releases nsp1, nsp2, and nsp3 functional proteins,

109

which play key role in viral replication (Rut et al., 2020). Therefore, these proteases would be

110

potential targets for development of broad-spectrum antiviral drugs. The crystal structures of

111

CoVs Mpro and PLpro enzymes are available for public access in protein data bank (PDB) (Table

112

2).

113

Natural phytochemicals based drugs are gaining importance in the modern world healthcare

114

sector, because of its less toxicity, effective health benefits and its potential use in conjunction

115

with preexisting therapies. Several literature studies have been reported antiviral properties of

116

phytochemicals against CoVs and other viruses (Mani et al., 2020; Ghildiyal et al., 2020). In

117

view of the issues posed above, the identification of natural broad-spectrum antiviral agents

118

against the CoVs is a more reasonable and attractive prospect, could provide an effective first

119

line of defense against future emerging CoVs related diseases. Herein, we report the natural

120

phycobilins as potent natural broad-spectrum inhibitor compounds against 3CLpro and PLpro of

121

SARS-CoV-2 and other CoVs via in silico and in-vitro approaches.

3D coordinate generation for the uploaded files (O’Boyle et al. 2011). The MGLTools were used

130

to delete other chains, heteroatoms (included water), adding missing atoms, hydrogens, charges.

131

The files (pdbqt) were further prepared for proteins and ligands binding.

132

2.1.2. Molecular docking studies

133

Autodock Vina was used as docking engine for docking. It is critical to define the docking grid

134

box appropriately due to the characteristic of small molecule docking procedure (Trott and Olson,

135

2010). The docking box is defined as the center of native ligand coordinates with 40Å×40Å×40Å

136

in length to include the residues of entire cavity, and the exhaustiveness level was set on 12 with

137

number of modes 10. For visualization, the docking results PDBQT files were exported and docked

138

protein-ligand complex structures were visualized using Pymol. Active site residues within 3 or

139

3.5 Å of ligand and polar contacts were determined with this same tool.

140

2.2. In-vitro enzymatic assays

141

For enzyme inhibition studies, selected phytochemicals; PCB, Quercetin, Riboflavin,

142

Cyanadin, Daidzein and Genestein were purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology (Santa Cruz,

143

CA). Enzyme assay kits; 3CL Protease, MBP-tagged (SARS-CoV-2) assay (Catalog #79955) and

144

papain-like protease (SARS-CoV-2) assay kit: protease activity (Catalog #79995) were purchased

145

from BPS Bioscience (San Diego, CA).

156

100% DMSO. Afterwards, the plate was pre-incubated for 30 min at room temperature with slow

157

shaking. Then the enzymatic reaction was initiated by addition of 5 µL of the substrate dissolved

158

in the reaction buffer to 25 μL final volume (final conc. 50 µM), incubated at room temperature

159

for 4 h. The fluorescence signal of the Edans generated due to the cleavage of the substrate by the

160

Mpro was monitored at an excitation at 360 nm with emission wavelength of 460 nm, using a

3. Results and Discussion

179

3.1. Selection of phytochemicals for the study

180

A total of fifteen phytochemicals from different chemical classes were selected based on the

181

previous reports of their potent anti-viral effects (Table S1); linear tetrapyrrole – phycocyanobilin

182

(PCB), flavonols - quercetin, catechin, flavin – riboflavin, anthocyanin - cyanidin, isoflavones -

183

daidzein, genistein, stilbenoid phenol – resveratrol, linear diarylheptanoid – curcumin,

184

Xanthophyll – astaxanthin, carotenes - β-carotene, phenolic alkaloid – capsaicin, phenolic ketone

185

186

3.2. In silico binding interaction studies of selected phytochemical compounds with SARS-CoV-2

187

Mpro and PLpro

188

The fifteen selected phytochemicals were docked into the active site pocket of SARS-CoV-2

189

Mpro and PLpro. Table 1 depicts source, docking score and polar contacts of selected phytochemical

190

bioactive compounds with binding site amino acid residues of SARS-CoV-2 proteases. For Mpro,

191

the results show phycocyanobilin (PCB) docked with best score or binding energy of -8.6 Kcal/mol

192

followed by Riboflavin (-7.9 Kcal/mol), Cyanidin (-7.9 Kcal/mol), Daidgein (-7.8 Kcal/mol) and

193

Genistein (-7.6 Kcal/mol). Twelve key active site amino acid residues (Tyr 54, Gly 143, His 163,

198

of 6WUU (Rut et al., 2020), the docking studies were performed with dimer form. Similarly, PCB

199

docked with best score or binding energy of -9.8 Kcal/mol followed by Astaxanthin, (-9.3

200

Kcal/mol), β-carotene (-9.2 Kcal/mol), Daidzein (-8.9 Kcal/mol), Riboflavin (-8.5 Kcal/mol) and

201

Genistein (-8.3 Kcal/mol). Eleven key active site aminoacid residues (Asp 164, Tyr 264, Gln 269,

202

Arg 166, Tyr 273, Glu 161, Tyr 268, Lys 157, Leu 162, Gly 266, Ser 170) in chain A and thirteen

203

amino acid residues (Arg 166, Gln 174, Met 208, Glu 161, Glu 167, Cys 155, Lys 232, Met 206,

204

Arg 183, Glu 203, Tyr 268, Tyr 273, Thr 301) in chain B of SARS-CoV-2 PLpro involved in polar

205

interactions at distance of ≤ 3 Å with ligand phytochemical compounds. Specific polar contacts of

206

each phytochemical compound were given in Table 1, and Figure 1 show 3 D representation of

207

binding pocket of Mpro and PLpro with top score model pose of PCB.

208

3.3. In vitro enzymatic assay studies to screen potent phytochemical inhibitor compounds against

209

SARS-CoV-2 Mpro and PLpro

210

To validate the molecular docking studies, in-vitro enzymatic studies were conducted. A

211

positive control without the inhibitor compound in the reaction mixture, an inhibitor control which

212

contains authentic inhibitors GC376 (for Mpro), GRL0617 (for PLpro) were used in this study. The

213

relative activity of the enzymes in the presence of inhibitors was estimated by considering positive

214

control activity as 100 %. Based on in silico studies, top six phytochemicals (PCB, quercetin,

215

riboflavin, cyanadin, daidzein and genestein) which showed significant inhibition were selected

216

for Mpro enzymatic assay studies. Initial screening results revealed that PCB had higher inhibitor

217

activity followed by quercetin, genestein, cyanidin and riboflavin (p < 0.05) (Fig. S1). Further

218

IC50 value of top two compounds; PCB and quercetin was determined, the results show effective

219

IC50 value of 71 µM for PCB (Fig. 2) than quercetin (145 µM) . For PLpro, four compounds

220

(Phycocyanobilin, Riboflavin, Genestein and Quercetin), were screened for inhibitor activity. It

221

was envisaged that PCB showed potent inhibitor activity in comparison to other compounds (Fig.

222

S1), with IC50 value of 62 μM (Fig. 2). Over all in silico docking and in vitro enzyme inhibitor

223

activity results showed PCB as a potent inhibitor against SARS-CoV-2 Mpro and PLpro. In addition

224

to above mentioned studies (Table S1), other studies reported antiviral activities of herbal and

225

medicinal some natural medicines and plant based bioactives compounds against various virus

226

strains including coronavirus; SARS-CoV-1, herpes simplex, human immunodeficiency virus,

227

hepatitis B and C viruses (Xian et al., 2020). From past few decades, there are numerous efforts to

228

reveal the specific mechanisms of antiviral activities of these natural compounds that effects viral

229

life cycle activities of viral entry, replication, assembly and release (Xian et al., 2020).

230

3.4 Broad-spectrum inhibitor activity of PCB against Mpro and PLpro

231

The broad-spectrum efficacy of PCB against CoVs was evaluated by molecular docking

232

studies with available crystal protein data bank (PDB) structure of various human and animal

233

CoVs. Table 2 show the PDB identification code and top docking scores of PCB with Mpro and

234

PLpro enzymes of human and animal CoVs. Due to limitation on availability of crystal PDB

235

structures of PLpro, both dimer and monomeric forms were used in docking studies. For Mpro,

236

docking scores are in the range of -8.3 to -9.3 K.cal/mol. PCB showed higher binding affinity with

237

docking score (-9.3 K.cal/mol) for MERS Mpro followed by HCoV NL63 (-9.0 K.cal/mol) and IBV

238

(-8.9 K.cal/mol). For PLpro, docking scores were in the range of -8.9 to -7.6 K.cal/mol. The results

239

revealed that PCB had higher binding affinity to dimer form of PLpro enzymes than monomeric

240

forms. When compared monomers only, PCB had best docking score for MERS-CoV (-8.5

241

K.cal/mol) followed by TGEV (-8.1 K.cal/mol) and SARS-CoV-2 (-8.0 K.cal/mol). Figure S2 and

242

S3 show polar contacts of PCB with binding pocket key amino acid residues of Mpro and PLpro

243

enzymes of human and animal CoVs. Surprisingly the docking results suggest PCB as a promising

244

broad-spectrum food bioactive inhibitor compound against CoVs proteases. The computed

245

physical properties of phycocyanobilin show rotatable bond count of 10, hydrogen bond donor

246

count of 5 and hydrogen bond acceptor count of 7 (NCBI, 2020), which makes multiple hydrogen

247

bond interactions between the compound and specific amino acid residues located at the active site

248

of the pocket of the protease enzymes. Molecular docking studies indicated that propionic carboxyl

249

and lactam ring carbonyl oxygens of PCB are involved in polar interactions with aminoacid

250

residues of proteases.

3.4 Inhibitor activities of other phycobilins

252

Phycobilins are linear tetrapyrrole chromophore compounds found in certain photosynthetic

253

organisms (cyanobacteria, red algae, glaucophytes, and some cryptomonads) and covalently linked

254

to phycobiliproteins (Beale, 1993). Four types of phycobilins are identified; i) Phycoerythrobilin

255

(PEB), ii) Phycourobilin (PUB), iii) Phycoviolobilin (PVB) and iv) Phycocyanobilin (PCB). Based

256

on results of PCB, the other phycobilins inhibitor activity against SARS-CoV-2 proteases via

257

molecular docking approach was demonstrated and docking scores, polar contacts were given in

258

Table 3. All phycobilins showed strong binding affinity to key amino acids of Mpro and PLpro

259

binding pockets. The docking scores were in the order of PUB (-8.7 Kcal/mol) > PCB (-8.6

260

Kcal/mol) > PEB (-8.2 Kcal/mol) > PVB (-8.2 Kcal/mol) for Mpro, whereas in case of PLpro, the

261

order was PCB (-9.8 Kcal/mol) = PEB (-9.8 Kcal/mol) > PUB (-9.6 Kcal/mol) > PVB (-9.5

262

Kcal/mol). Nine key binding pocket amino acids (Y54, L141, G143, S144, C145, H163, E166,

263

D187, Q189) of Mpro were participated in polar contacts with phycobilins, specific polar contacts

264

of each phycobilin were shown in Figure S4. Ten key binding pocket amino acids (D164 (A),

265

Y264 (A), R166 (A), G266 (A), E161 (A), L162 (A), G271 (A), K232 (A), R166 (B), T301 (B))

266

of PLpro were participated in polar contacts with phycobilins, specific polar contacts were shown

267

in Figure S5.

268

In addition, potent therapeutic properties such as; peroxy radical scavenging, inhibition of

269

cancer cell proliferation and platelet aggregation, had been reported for phycobilins (Wantanabe,

270

Yabuta & Bito, 2014). Shih et al. (2003) reported direct antiviral activity of phycocyanin against

271

enterovirus 71 in human rhabdomyosarcoma cells and African green monkey kidney cells.

272

Phycobilin compounds can be directly administered orally as phycobiliproteins (complex of

273

phycobilins and protein). For instance, when phycocyanin administered orally to humans, it can

274

be digested and free phycocyanobilin released in the gastrointestinal tract (Wantanabe, Yabuta &

275

Bito, 2014). Thus, noticed therapeutic properties of phycobiliproteins may reflect the effects of

276

their phycobilins (chromophores).

277

In conclusion, by using, in silico molecular docking, invitro enzymatic assay screenings, we

278

discovered PCB as potent phytochemical inhibitors to Mpro and PLpro proteases of SARS-CoV-2.

279

Phycocyanobilin had IC50 values of 71 and 62 μM for SARS-CoV-2 Mpro and PLpro, respectively.

280

Further PCB docking studies with other CoVs Mpro and PLpro proteases revealed its broad-spectrum

281

inhibitor activity. Also, similar binding affinity of other phycobilins (PEB, PUB and PVB) to these

282

proteases was observed. However invitro enzymatic studies with Mpro and PLpro of other CoVs

283

consequently in-vivo studies on inhibition of CoVs infectivity using human cells and animal

284

models are needed. Further structure guided development of phycobilin lead compounds could

285

rapidly lead to the discovery of a single agent with clinical potential against existing and possible

286

future emerging CoV-associated diseases.
