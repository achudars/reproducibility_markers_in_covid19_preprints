Abstract

2

Repurposing clinically available drugs to treat the new coronavirus disease COVID-19 is

3

an urgent need in these early stages of the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic, when very few

4

treatment options are available. The iminosugar Miglustat is a well-characterized drug for

5

the treatment of rare genetic lysosome storage diseases such as Gaucher and Niemann-

6

Pick type C, and has also been described to be active against a variety of enveloped

7

viruses. The activity of Miglustat is here demonstrated for SARS-CoV-2 at concentrations

8

achievable in the plasma by current clinical regimens without cytotoxicity. The drug acts at

9

the post-entry level and leads to a marked decrease of viral proteins and release of

10

infectious virus. The mechanism resides in the inhibitory activity towards α-glucosidases

11

that are involved in early stages of glycoprotein N-linked oligosaccharide processing in the

12

endoplasmic reticulum, leading to a marked decrease of the viral Spike protein. The

13

wealth of available data on the clinical use of Miglustat for the treatment of lysosomal

14

storage disorders and the antiviral properties against SARS-CoV-2 make it an ideal

15

candidate for drug repurposing.

Introduction

2

The novel Severe Acquired Respiratory Syndrome (SARS-CoV-2) coronavirus, the

3

etiologic agent of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), has now spread in everywhere

4

causing a global pandemic (1, 2). To date there have been more than 3.5 million reported

5

cases and 250.000 deaths worldwide urging for a global effort to tackle the disease (3).

6

SARS-CoV-2 belongs to the genus Betacoronavirus of the order/family/sub-family

7

Nidovirales/Coronaviridae/Coronavirinae. The virion is enveloped and contains a single

8

RNA genome of positive polarity. Morphologically, SARS-CoV-2 is about 120 nm in

9

diameter with large projections of the heavily glycosylated trimeric spike (S) proteins.

10

Other surface proteins include the membrane (M) and envelope (E) proteins, while inside

11

the envelope the helical nucleocapsid (N) wraps the viral RNA. The virus targets cells of

12

the upper and lower respiratory tract epithelia through the viral Spike that binds to the

13

angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) receptor, a process facilitated by the host type 2

14

transmembrane serine protease, TMPRSS2. Once inside the cell, viral polyproteins are

15

synthesized that encode for the replication machinery required to synthesize new RNA via

16

its RNA-dependent RNA polymerase activity. Replication is cytoplasmatic at the level of

17

the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) that is heavily rearranged. Structural proteins are then

18

synthesized leading to completion of assembly and release of viral particles (4, 5).

19

Currently, no specific treatment against SARS-CoV-2 is available and the only antiviral

20

therapy comes from repurposing of drugs developed for other viral infections. Lopinavir

21

and ritonavir, remdesivir, (hydroxy)chloroquine, umifenovir and favipiravir are examples

22

that are currently being evaluated, but none have been conclusively shown to be effective

23

(6).

24

The iminosugar Miglustat (Zavesca; N-butyl-1-deoxynojirimycin, NB-DNJ) inhibits α-

25

glucosidases I and II that are involved in early stages of glycoprotein N-linked

26

oligosaccharide processing in the ER (7). Because most enveloped viruses require

27

glycosylation for surface protein folding and secretion, modulation of the oligosaccharide

28

to induce a reduction in infectivity became a strategy for treatment of the immune

29

deficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1), culminating in phase I/II clinical trials (8, 9). The use of

30

iminosugars to misfold viral glycoprotein as a therapeutic approach has so far been

31

applied to several other viral infections including: hepatitis B and C viruses, Dengue and

32

other flaviviruses, and Ebola virus (10-12). An additional property of certain iminosugars is

33

the Glucosyltransferase inhibition activity, which is the basis for current therapy of rare

34

genetic lysosome storage diseases such as Gaucher and Niemann-Pick type C (13). This

35

activity of Miglustat could impact virus entry by modification of the plasma membrane.

The wealth of data on the clinical use of Miglustat for the treatment of lysosomal storage

2

disorders and the antiviral properties observed on enveloped viruses make Miglustat an

3

ideal candidate of drug repurposing for COVID-19. In this work Miglustat is shown to be

4

active for the inhibition of SARS-CoV-2 in different cell types at concentrations compatible

5

with those obtained for the treatment of Gaucher and Niemann-Pick type C in patients.

6

Time of addition studies indicate that the inhibitory activity is at the post-entry level and

7

affects release of infectious virus. The proper folding and release of the Spike protein, and

8

progeny virus appear mostly affected.

6

Bartenschlager (University of Heidelberg, Germany) were cultured in Dulbecco’s modified

7

Eagle’s medium (DMEM) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS, Gibco) and

8

antibiotics. Cell cultures were maintained at 37 °C under 5% CO2. Cells were routinely

9

tested for mycoplasma contamination.

10

Working stocks of SARS-CoV-2 ICGEB-FVG_5 isolated in Trieste, Italy, were routinely

11

propagated and titrated on Vero E6 cells (14). Plaque assay was performed by incubating

12

dilutions of SARS-CoV-2 on Vero E6 monolayers at 37 °C for 1 hour, which were then

13

washed with phosphate buffered saline (PBS) and overlaid with DMEM 2% FBS

14

containing 1.5% carboxymethylcellulose for 3 days. Cells were then fixed with 3.7%

15

paraformaldehyde (PFA) and stained with crystal violet 1%. Cytotoxicity assay was

16

performed with Alamar Blue (ThermoFisher) according to manufacturer’s instructions.

Drugs and proteins

19

Miglustat (NB-DNJ) was purchased from Sigma (B8299). The drug was dissolved in

20

DMSO to obtain a stock solution, while following dilutions were made directly in growth

21

medium.

22

The SARS-CoV-2 Spike protein receptor-binding domain (RBD) was expressed from

23

pCAGGS using a construct generously provided by Florian Krammer (Mount Sinai, New

24

York) (15). Plasmid was transfected in 293T cells and cell extracts and supernatants were

25

harvested 24 hours post-transfection. Miglustat 200 µM was added after transfection and

26

maintained in the medium until the end of the experiment.

27

Sequence coding for the full length Spike protein was obtained from isolate Wuhan-Hu-1

28

(NCBI Reference Sequence: NC_045512.2). The nucleotide sequence, fused to an

29

immunoglobulin leader sequence (sec) at the N-terminus, codon optimized for expression

30

in mammalian cells, was obtained as synthetic DNA fragment from GenScript Biotech

31

(Netherlands) and cloned as HindIII/ApaI into a pCDNA3 vector.

hour. Following incubation, the virus was removed and the wells washed with 1x PBS. The

2

infected cells were maintained with 800 µL of overlay medium containing 1.5%

3

carboxymethylcellulose (CMC) with DMEM + 2% heat-inactivated FBS, and Miglustat

4

dilutions. Cells were then incubated at 37 °C for 3 days. Finally, cells were fixed with 3.7%

5

PFA and stained with crystal violet. Plaques were counted and values were normalized to

6

vehicle (DMSO). The plaque reduction assays were conducted

7

in double replicates for three independent experiments. Inhibition was calculated with the

8

formula: (1-(average plaques Miglustat/average plaques Vehicle))*100 and plotted against

9

dilutions as antilog. For the cytotoxicity assay, fluorescence readings were normalized for

10

vehicle and percent plotted against dilutions. The half maximal effective concentration

Immunoblotting and Immunofluorescence

15

A recombinant monoclonal reactive with the receptor-binding domain of the S protein was

16

generated based on a mouse small immune protein (SIP) scaffold (mSIP-3022). The DNA

17

fragment encoding for the variable regions VL (NCBI accession code: DQ168570.1) and

18

VH (NCBI accession code: DQ168569.1) of human monoclonal antibody, clone CR3022

19

(16, 17), was synthetized as scFV by GenScript Biotech (Netherlands) and cloned into

20

ApaLI-BspEI sites upstream of Hinge-CH2-CH3 domains of mouse IgG2b expression

21

vector as described previously (18). The plasmid was transfected in ExpiCHO-S

22

cells (Gibco-Thermo Fisher Scientific) following manufacturer’s instructions. Eight days

23

post transfection the supernatant was loaded on the HiTrap protein G HP 1ml column (GE

24

Healthcare) in binding buffer (20 mM sodium phosphate pH 7.0) and eluted with acetic

25

acid 50mM pH 2.7. Eluted antibody was immediately neutralized with 1M Tris pH 8, and

26

analyzed by RP-HPLC and by SDS PAGE to maintain the dimeric structure. Production

27

yield was 0.8 mg/ml. For immunofluorescence cells were fixed in 3.7% PFA, permeabilized

28

with 0.01% Triton and processed with mSIP-3022 as per standard procedure (19). Since

29

mSIP-3022 did not react with the denatured S protein a convalescent serum from a

30

COVID-19 patient was used for immunoblotting at a 1:200 dilution. Images were acquired

31

on a Zeiss LSM880 confocal microscope. For immunoblotting, whole-cell lysates were

32

resolved by 12% SDS-PAGE and blotted onto nitrocellulose membranes. The membranes

33

were blocked in 5% nonfat milk in Tris-buffered saline (TBS) plus 0.1% Tween 20 (TBST),

34

followed by incubation with the human serum diluted 1:200 in the same solution for 1 hour

Results

2

The antiviral properties of Miglustat were assessed by performing a plaque assay. SARS-

3

CoV-2 strain ICGEB-FVG_5 was used to infect Vero E6 for 1 hour. After removal of the

4

inoculum and wash in PBS, the cells were overlaid with medium containing 1.5% CMC and

5

dilutions of drug as indicated in Figure 1A. 72 hours post-infection cells were fixed and

6

stained to reveal plaques, which were visually counted. Data are from three independent

7

experiments each in duplicate biological replicates. In parallel, cytotoxicity was assessed

8

by the Alamar blue method at the indicated dilutions of drug. The effective concentration

9

for 50% inhibition (EC50) of Miglustat was 41±22 µM with no apparent cyototoxicity until 1

10

mM (CC50 > 1 mM). The plaque assay was performed in Vero E6 cells, which are standard

11

for the growth of SARS-CoV-2. However, further analysis would be better performed in

12

cells of human origin.

13
14

In order to establish an infectious model in human cells a number of available cell lines

15

were tested including U2OS (osteosarcoma), A549 (adenocarcinoma of the human

16

alveolar basal epithelial), HEK 293 (human embryonic kidney cells) and Huh7

17

(hepatocellular carcinoma). None of the cell lines tested supported SARS-CoV-2 infection

18

except for the Huh7 hepatocellular carcinoma cell line. As shown in Supplementary Figure

19

S1A, Huh7 supported SARS-CoV-2 infection, albeit delayed 24 hours and at a lower

20

efficiency compared to Vero E6. Furthermore, in order to stain infected cells a protocol for

21

immunofluorescence was established. To this end, a recombinant monoclonal based on

22

SIP mouse scaffold (mSIP-3022) was generated carrying the CDR regions of the antibody

23

CR3022 reactive against the receptor binding domain (RBD) of the Spike protein of SARS-

24

CoV-1, which showed high binding affinity also for SARS-CoV-2 Spike protein (17). As

25

shown in Supplementary Figure S1B, mSIP-3022 efficiently stains the Spike protein in the

26

cytoplasm of infected Vero E6 and Huh7 cells 24 hours post-infection.

27
28

Next, the efficiency of Huh7 infection was assessed in the presence of Miglustat. As

29

shown in Figure 1B and quantified in Figure 1C, Miglustat maintained the number of Huh7

30

infected cells at the level observed 24 hpi, while mock treated cells showed an increase of

31

infected cells at 48 hpi as expected form an expansion of the infection in the cell culture.

32

These data confirm the inhibitory effect of Miglustat in cells of human origin and might

33

suggest that the activity of Miglustat is at the level of the secretion of new infectious virus

34

and not at the entry/replication level.

1

To better characterize this hypothesis, a time-of-addition (TOA) experiment was

2

performed. Different conditions were used: pre-treatment, co-treatment and post-

3

treatment. Huh7 cells were pre-treated with 200 µM Miglustat for 3h and then infected for

4

1h in the absence of drug (moi = 0.1). Afterwards, the virus was removed and the cells

5

were cultured in drug-free medium until the end of the experiment. For co-treatment, the

6

drug was added together with the virus during infection and then cells were maintained in

7

drug-free medium. For post-entry experiment, drug was added at 3 h post-infection and

8

maintained until the end of the experiment. As shown in Figure 2A, drug didn’t affect viral

9

entry, neither was virucidal when administered concomitant with infection. Replication

10

(intracellular viral RNA) was slightly affected at 48hpi and significantly at 72hpi consistent

11

with the idea that Miglustat was effective at the post-entry level. This was reflected by the

12

reduction of intracellular nucleocapsid N protein observed at both time points (Figure 2B).

13

Interestingly, a strong reduction of infectious virus was observed in post-entry conditions

14

(Figure 2C and 2D) paralleled by a decrease of extracellular viral genomes (Figure 2E and

15

2F) and N protein (Figure 2G).

16
17

Miglustat activity at the post-entry level is expected to target proper folding and

18

glycosylation of virion proteins. Spike and its receptor-binding domain are heavily

19

glycosylated and undergo folding and glycosylation through the ER before being secreted

20

and exposed on the plasma membrane. Previous data on the Spike protein of SARS-CoV-

21

1 indicated that both glycosylation and secretion were affected by Miglustat (21, 22).

22

Therefore we took advantage of an expression vector for SARS-CoV-2 Spike RBD to

23

assess the effect of Miglustat treatment on protein release from transfected 293T cells. As

24

shown in figure 2H, the protein is highly abundant in the cell supernatant in normal

25

conditions, but, upon treatment with 200 µM Miglustat, the protein was much less

26

abundant. These data point to a role of Miglustat as an inhibitor of the proper folding and

27

release of functional Spike protein. To reinforce this observation, full-length spike was

28

transfected in 293T cells and the fully folded protein expressed on the cell surface

29

detected by the conformation-dependent mSIP-3022 antibody. As shown in Figure 2J and

30

2K, Miglustat reduce the amount of protein on the cell surface.

Discussion

2

Host directed antiviral therapy is a strategy of inhibiting virus infection by targeting host

3

factors that are essential for viral replication (23). Currently there is a pressing need for

4

antiviral drugs for immediate use in the context of SARS-CoV-2 infection. Miglustat is a

5

drug that is in current clinical use for the treatment of certain genetic disorders and has

6

shown to be active against a variety of viral infections, making it a suitable candidate for

7

drug repurposing towards SARS-CoV-2. In this work the activity of Miglustat against

8

SARS-CoV-2 has been demonstrated in vitro with EC50 in the micromolar range. The

9

standard dosage for lysosomal storage diseases such as Gaucher or Niemann Pick is 100

10

mg/3 times a day, with a maximum daily dose of 600 mg/day. A single dose of 100 mg

11

Miglustat reaches a peak in plasma concentration of around 3-5 µM within 4 hours, while

12

half-life is approximately 8 hours. If this dose is administered every 4 hours/6 times per

13

day, the plasma concentration of Miglustat would stabilize around 10 µM (24). If 200 mg

14

Miglustat is administered every 8 hours/3 times a day, the plasma concentration could be

15

also higher than 10 µM in 24 hours. However, increased dosage could lead to well-

16

described

17

thrombocytopenia.

18

Miglustat has been shown to act through two different mechanisms: at the level of virus

19

entry, by perturbing the plasma membrane, and at the level of folding and secretion of

20

virion proteins, by affecting essential glycosylation steps in the ER. The latter mechanism

21

is supported by the data presented in this work, where a strong antiviral activity is detected

22

only when the drug is added post-infection. Correct folding and secretion of glycoproteins

23

is a process tightly controlled in the ER by chaperons such as Calnexin that recognize

24

specific glycosylation intermediates (25). Miglustat interferes with this process resulting in

25

the accumulation of misfolded proteins and a defect in secretion. Consistently, the Spike

26

protein of SARS-CoV-1 has been shown to bind Calnexin and disruption of this function

27

caused decrease of virus infectivity (22).

28

In conclusion this work provides in vitro evidence for the use of Miglustat as inhibitor of

29

SARS-CoV-2 and proposes its use in clinical trials for COVID-19 patients.

secreted SARS-CoV-2 was detected with a convalescent human serum.

31

H) Secretion of SARS-CoV-2 Spike RBD. The his-tagged Spike-RBD was expressed in

32

HEK 293T cells in the presence of Miglustat and protein detected by immunoblot for the

33

his-tag both in supernatant and cell extracts with β-actin as loading control.

A) SARS-CoV-2 infectivity. Vero E6 and Huh7 cells were infected in parallel with SARS-

7

CoV-2 at moi 0.1. At the indicated time points RNA was extracted from the cells and

8

measured by RT PCR for SARS-CoV-2 genomes. Data are plotted as fold change

9

over T0.

10

B) Immunofluorecence assay. Vero E6 and Huh7 cells were infected with SARS-CoV-2

11

moi = 0.1 for 24 hours. Cells were then fixed and stained with mSIP-3022 antibody against

12

Spike (red) to acquire confocal images. Nuclei are stained by DAPI. Bar corresponds to 20

13

µM.
