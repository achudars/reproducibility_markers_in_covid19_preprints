Abstract
Coronaviruses (CoVs) are important human pathogens for which no specific treatment is available.
Here, we provide evidence that pharmacological reprogramming of ER stress pathways can be
exploited to suppress CoV replication. We found that the ER stress inducer thapsigargin efficiently
inhibits coronavirus (HCoV-229E, MERS-CoV, SARS-CoV-2) replication in different cell types,
(partially) restores the virus-induced translational shut-down, and counteracts the CoV-mediated
downregulation of IRE1α and the ER chaperone BiP. Proteome-wide data sets revealed specific
pathways, protein networks and components that likely mediate the thapsigargin-induced antiviral
state, including HERPUD1, an essential factor of ER quality control, and ER-associated protein
degradation complexes. The data show that thapsigargin hits a central mechanism required for CoV
replication, suggesting that thapsigargin (or derivatives thereof) may be developed into broadspectrum anti-CoV drugs.
Introduction
Coronaviruses are enveloped plus-strand RNA viruses with a broad host range, including humans (de
Wit et al, 2016; Gorbalenya et al, 2020). The four seasonal human CoVs (HCoV-229E, -NL63, HKU1, -OC43) generally cause a spectrum of (mild) symptoms that are mainly restricted to the upper
respiratory tract (Gerna et al, 2006; Greenberg, 2011; Jevsnik et al, 2012; Nicholson et al, 1997). In
contrast, the three highly pathogenic CoVs that emerged from animal reservoirs over the past two
decades are frequently associated with significant disease burden and mortality in humans. The latter
include the severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) CoV (Drosten et al, 2003; Guan et al, 2004;
Rota et al, 2003), SARS-CoV-2 (Zhou et al, 2020; Zhu et al, 2020) and Middle East respiratory
syndrome CoV (MERS-CoV) (Zaki et al, 2012).
The current SARS-CoV-2 pandemic highlights the urgent need to identify new antiviral strategies,
including drugs that target the host side (Zhu et al., 2020). CoVs impose multiple functional but also
structural changes to a wide range of cellular pathways and there is increasing evidence that some of
these pathways may be exploited therapeutically (de Wilde et al, 2018; Fung & Liu, 2019).
In common with other cellular stress conditions, including infections by diverse pathogens, CoVs are
known to activate the NF-κB, JNK and p38 MAPK pathways and to reprogram host cell
transcriptomes (Liao et al, 2011; Mizutani et al, 2005; Poppe et al, 2017). In addition, they induce the
formation of replicative organelles (ROs), an intracellular network of double-membrane vesicles
(DMV) that harbors the viral replication/transcription complexes (RTC) and shields these complexes
from recognition by cellular defense mechanisms (Snijder et al, 2020). The combination of these and
other events leads to cell damage and cell death upon virus budding and release within a few days (de
Wilde et al., 2018). The virus-induced cellular changes are associated with an activation of the
unfolded protein response (UPR) which is evident from a profound transcriptomic endoplasmic
reticulum (ER) stress signature, as recently reported for cells infected with HCoV-229E (Poppe et al.,
2017).
The ER is critically involved in surveying the quality and fidelity of membrane and secreted protein
synthesis, as well as the folding, assembly, transport and degradation of these proteins (Wang &
Kaufman, 2016). The accumulation of unfolded or misfolded proteins in the ER lumen leads to ER
stress and UPR activation, thereby slowing down protein synthesis and increasing the folding capacity
of the ER (Karagoz et al, 2019). As a result, cellular protein homeostasis can be restored and the cell
survives. If this compensatory mechanism fails, ER stress pathways can also switch function and will
eventually induce oxidative stress and cell death (Hetz & Papa, 2018; Wang & Kaufman, 2016).

The system relies on three ER membrane-inserted sensors, including the protein kinase R (PKR)-like
ER kinase (PERK), inositol-requiring protein 1α (IRE1α) and cyclic AMP-dependent transcription
factor 6α (ATF6α). PERK and IRE1α are Ser/Thr kinases whose conserved N termini are oriented
towards the ER lumen (Wu et al, 2014). In non-stressed cells, the highly abundant major ER
chaperone and ER stress sensor binding-immunoglobulin protein BiP (also called 78 kDa glucoseregulated protein, GPR78; heat shock protein family A member 5, HSPA5) binds to PERK and IRE1α,
which keeps these two proteins in an inactive monomeric state (Bertolotti et al, 2000; Pobre et al,
2019). Upon increased binding of BiP to misfolded ER clients, BiP is released from both PERK and
IRE1α, resulting in an (indirect) activation of the two kinases by oligomerization and
trans(auto)phosphorylation (Carrara et al, 2015; Cui et al, 2011; Kopp et al, 2019).
Active PERK phosphorylates the eukaryotic translation initiation factor 2 (eIF2) subunit α to shut
down translation and also activates ATF4, the master transcription factor orchestrating ER stressinduced genes (Han et al, 2013; Urra & Hetz, 2017). Phosphorylated IRE1α activates its own RNase
domain to generate spliced (s)XBP1 protein, a multifunctional transcriptional regulator responsible for
adaptive responses but also cell death (Chen & Brandizzi, 2013). The specific function(s) in this
response of yet another ER stress-activated transcription factor, ATF3, is less well understood
(Mungrue et al, 2009). Generally, the various branches of the UPR act in concert, allowing a multitude
of potential outcomes, ranging from the compensation of ER stress and restoration of proteostasis to
cell death (Hetz & Papa, 2018).
The activation of ER stress by infectious agents has been widely observed. However, with few
exceptions, it remains to be studied how this response is shaped in a microbe-specific manner and
whether or not these responses are beneficial or detrimental to the host (Grootjans et al, 2016).
Moreover, there is a lack of knowledge on CoV-mediated (de)regulation of ER stress components at
the protein level. The latter is important because CoVs, in common with many RNA viruses, are
known to cause a global shutdown of host protein synthesis (Hilton et al, 1986).
Here, we report that CoV infection activates UPR signaling and induces ER stress components at the
mRNA level but suppresses them at the protein level. Strikingly, the well-known chemical activator of
the UPR, thapsigargin, exerts a profound antiviral effect in the lower nanomolar range on three
different CoVs in different cell types. A detailed proteomics analysis reveals multiple thapsigarginregulated pathways and a network of proteins that are suppressed by CoV but (re)activated by
chemically stressed infected cells. These results reveal new insight into central factors required for
CoV replication and open new avenues for targeted CoV antivirals.
Results
To investigate how CoVs modulate ER stress components at the mRNA compared to the protein level,
we determined the expression levels of 166 components of the ER stress pathway KEGG 04141
“protein processing in endoplasmic reticulum” in human HuH7 liver cells, a commonly used cellular
model for CoV replication, in response to infections with HCoV-229E and MERS-CoV, respectively.
For untreated HuH7 cells, we obtained mRNA (by RNA-seq) and protein (by LC-MS/MS) expression
data for 119 components which revealed a positive correlation between mRNA and protein
abundancies (Fig.1A, upper graph). However, in cell lysates obtained at 24 h post infection (p.i.), this
effect was largely lost (Fig. 1A, middle and lower graph). Pearson correlation matrix confirmed a
progressive loss of correlation between mRNA levels and protein levels for this pathway over a time
course from 3 h to 24 h p.i. (Fig. 1B). Thus, out of 37 (for HCoV-229E) or 56 (for MERS-CoV) ER
stress factors that were found to be regulated at the mRNA level, only a few remained (down)regulated
at the protein level at late time points (Fig. 1C, Fig. S1).

To determine the functional consequences of this opposing regulation at the mRNA and protein levels
in CoV-infected cells, we focused on HCoV-229E and assessed key regulatory features of the ER
stress pathway as shown in Fig. 2A. As a reference, we included samples from cells exposed to
thapsigargin, a compound that has been widely used to study prototypically activated ER stress
mechanistically (Bertolotti et al., 2000; Oslowski & Urano, 2011). This setup included experiments, in
which thapsigargin and virus were added simultaneously to the cell culture medium (followed by a
further incubation for 24 h) or thapsigargin was added to the cells at 8 h p.i. for 16 h (Fig. 2B).
The presence of thapsigargin in the growth medium resulted in a major drop in viral titers by more
than 150-fold (from 9.18*106 to 5.7*104 pfu / ml) which was paralleled by reduced amounts of viral
RNA isolated from thapsigargin-treated, HCoV-229E-infected infected cells at 24 h p.i. (Fig. 2C).
Immunofluorescence analysis of HCoV-229E-infected cells treated with thapsigargin confirmed the
impaired formation of functional viral replication/transcription complexes (RTCs) as shown by the
reduced levels of both double-stranded RNA (an intermediate of viral RNA replication) and
nonstructural protein (nsp) 8 (an essential part of the viral RTC) (Fig. 2D).
A strong suppression of viral replication was also demonstrated by the reduced protein levels observed
for the nucleocapsid (N) protein (a major coronavirus structural protein) as well as nonstructural
proteins (nsp) 8 and 12, both of which representing essential components of the viral replication
complex (Snijder et al, 2016) (Fig. 2E, F). In all cases, the antiviral effect of thapsigargin remained
readily detectable when the compound was added at 8 h p.i, suggesting that it does not prevent viral
entry but rather suppresses intracellular pathways required for efficient RNA replication and/or
particle formation and release or activates unknown antiviral effector systems (Fig. 2C-F).
Next, we investigated ER stress signaling under these conditions. Both virus and thapsigargin were
confirmed to activate the PERK branch of ER stress (Fig. 2E, F), as shown by the retarded mobility of
PERK in SDS gels (indicating multisite phosphorylation) and by phosphorylation of the PERK
substrate eIF2α at Ser51 (Fig. 2E, F). Unlike thapsigargin treatment, HCoV-229E infection led to a
weak but significant decrease of PERK (mean 71±15 %) and eIF2α (mean 67±13 %) levels compared
to the controls. Infection also caused an approximately twofold (mean 42±22 %) reduction in BiP
expression (Fig. 2E, F). In contrast, long-term thapsigargin treatment (for 16 h or 24 h) caused a 3–4fold increase in BiP expression, also in HCoV-229E-infected cells, thus reversing the suppression by
viral infection (Fig. 2E, F). Similarly, thapsigargin treatment for 16 h or 24 h caused a 1.5–2-fold
increase in IRE1α expression (but not phosphorylation), again also in infected cells (Fig. 2E, F). In
this set of experiments, ATF3 proved to be the only protein that was induced by virus alone (Fig. 2E,
F), while the expression levels of ATF4 remained largely unchanged (Fig. 2E, F).
These data show that both CoV infection and chemicals like thapsigargin activate ER stress through
the same proximal PERK pathway, although they affect downstream cellular outcomes differentially.
The restoration of BiP and IRE1α levels by long-term thapsigargin treatment further suggests that the
CoV-induced block of inducible host factors is not irreversible and can be reprogrammed by a
(presumably protective) thapsigargin-mediated response. Our comparative analyses of viral replication
and host response lead us to conclude that chemically and virus-induced forms of ER stress, although
proceeding through the same core PERK pathway, do not simply potentiate each other but rather
(somewhat counterintuitively) counteract each other.

To explore a potential pharmacological exploitation of this effect, we assessed the cytotoxicity of the
combined thapsigargin treatment and virus infection, because both conditions are known to promote
cell death.
At 24 h p.i., cell viability of HCoV-229E-infected HuH7 cells was only marginally reduced (mean
90.02±12.32 %) (Fig. 2G, upper graph). After 24 h of incubation, thapsigargin decreased cell
viability in a dose-dependent manner with a CC50 of 10.7 µM in line with previous reports (Fig. 2G,
middle graph, Fig. 2H) (Sehgal et al, 2017; Tombal et al, 2000). The combination of thapsigargin
and HCoV-229E infection did not cause additional cytotoxicity as shown by a nearly identical CC50 of
9.7 µM (lower graph, Fig. 2G, Fig. 2H). At 1 µM thapsigargin, i.e., a concentration shown to
completely abolish viral protein translation and replication (see above), the cell viability of cells
infected with HCoV-229E and treated with thapsigargin was 76.6±7.9 %, suggesting that thapsigargin
exerts its antiviral effects at concentrations well below its cytotoxic concentrations (Fig. 2G, H).
To further characterize the metabolic state of the cells under the conditions used in these experiments,
we investigated protein de novo synthesis. Newly produced proteins were quantified by in vivo
puromycinylation tagging of nascent protein chains followed by immunoblotting using anti-puromycin
antibodies. HCoV-229E was found to shut down protein biosynthesis by 90.3±5.4% while 1 h of
thapsigargin treatment led to a shutdown by 94.3±4.3% (Fig. 2I). However, in infected cells, the
simultaneous or delayed addition of thapsigargin restored (or rescued) protein biosynthesis to
approximately 50 % of the level observed in untreated cells (Fig. 2I). These data demonstrate that,
although both viral infection and thapsigargin treatment (individually) induce ER stress and cause a
translational shut-down, their combination shows no additive harmful effects to the cells. On the
contrary, their combination appears to have opposing effects that result in a partial restoration of the
cellular metabolic capacity while retaining a profound antiviral effect.
We next assessed if these effects were cell-type or virus-specific. In line with the results described
above, the antiviral effects of thapsigargin, the reconstitution of the BiP and IRE1α levels and the lack
of additional cytotoxicity in infected cells could be confirmed for diploid MRC-5 embryonic lung
fibroblasts infected with HCoV-229E (Fig. 3A-D), as well as for HuH7 cells infected with MERSCoV and Vero E6 African green monkey kidney epithelial cells infected with SARS-CoV-2 (Fig. 3EK, Fig. S2A, B). MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 replication were suppressed by thapsigargin with an
effective concentration (EC50) (as judged by virus titration) of 4.8 nM and 260 nM, respectively (Fig.
3I, J), while the CC50 for thapsigargin in Vero E6 cells was 17.22 µM (Fig. 3K), resulting in
selectivity indices (SI, CC50/EC50) of 66.2 for SARS-CoV-2 and 2229.2 for MERS-CoV, respectively.
To characterize the underlying molecular mechanisms responsible for the observed antiviral effects of
thapsigargin, we focused on two highly pathogenic coronaviruses, MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV, for
which, to our knowledge, no side-by-side comparison of proteomic changes has been reported to date.
The large-scale proteomic study included (i) untreated cells and cells that were (ii) infected with
MERS-CoV, (iii) SARS-CoV-2, (iv) treated with thapsigargin, (v and vi) infected with one of these
viruses in the presence of thapsigargin. We used label-free quantification of six replicates per sample
to determine the expression levels of > 5000 proteins from total cell extracts.
In a systematic approach, we identified differentially expressed proteins (DEPs) based on pairwise
comparisons of proteins obtained from untreated cells, virus-infected cells or thapsigargin-treated cells
using a p value of -log10 ≥ 1.3 as cut-off. As visualized by Volcano plot representations, MERS-CoV
infection suppressed 413 (at 12 h p.i.) and 1171 proteins (at 24 h p.i.), respectively, and increased the
levels of 150 proteins (at 12 h p.i.) and 508 proteins (at 24 h p.i.), respectively (Fig. 4A, B), while

SARS-CoV-2 suppressed the expression of 232 proteins at 12 h p.i. and 141 proteins at 24 h p.i. and
increased the expression of 184 proteins at 12 h p.i. and 56 proteins at 24 h p.i. (Fig. 4C, D).
Thapsigargin treatment alone suppressed / induced large numbers of proteins in HuH7 cells (969
down, 923 up at 12 h; 1711 down, 958 up at 24 h) and in Vero E6 cells (201 down, 179 up at 12 h; 216
down, 149 up at 24 h) (Fig. 4A-D). As expected, this analysis also identified viral proteins as the most
strongly regulated DEPs. A comparison of virus-infected cells with virus-infected cells treated with
thapsigargin revealed a complete suppression of all viral proteins and a large number of proteins with
increased expression in thapsigargin-treated cells infected with MERS-CoV (676, 12 h p.i.; 1,100, 24
h p.i.; blue groups of proteins) or SARS-CoV-2 (268, 12 h; 326, 24 h; blue groups of proteins) (Fig.
4A-D, right graphs). Also, similar numbers of proteins were identified with higher expression in
virus-infected cells compared to virus-infected cells treated with thapsigargin (Fig. 4A-D, right
graphs; red groups of proteins). Together, these data lead us to conclude that thapsigargin causes a
profound shift in protein expression in infected cells that likely contributes to the antiviral effects of
this compound.
We then devised a bioinformatics strategy to identify patterns of co-regulated or unique pathways and
link deregulated protein sets identified in these data to specific (known) biological functions. As
shown schematically in Fig. 4E, we sorted the DEPs from each of the four groups shown in Fig. 4A-D
into four multiple gene ID lists, annotated the gene IDs to biological pathways and generated
hierarchically clustered heatmaps of the top 100 differentially enriched pathway categories for the 12 h
p.i. and 24 h p.i. time points of MERS-CoV- and SARS-CoV-2-infected cells, respectively, versus
thapsigargin-treated cells by overrepresentation analysis (ORA) using Metascape software (Zhou et al,
2019). In this analysis, the groups of up- or downregulated proteins were kept separate to preserve
information on whether specific DEPs belonging to particular overrepresented pathway terms were
regulated in the same or opposite direction. Inspection of the four top 100 clustered heatmaps shows
many similarities but also differences in pathways and their enrichment p values in response to virus
infection or thapsigargin, all together demonstrating the complexity of the cellular response to CoV
infections or chemical stressors (Fig. S3-S4). By condensing this information to the top 5 pathways for
up-/or downregulated DEPs we found that many of the most highly enriched categories are related to
RNA, DNA, metabolic functions and localization (Fig. S5A). We then combined the 400 pathway
categories and searched this list for identical or unique GO terms in response to MERS-CoV, SARSCoV-2 or thapsigargin. By filtering 227 pathways (out of 400) with enrichment p values ≤ -log10 3 we
found 27 pathway categories shared by both viruses and by thapsigargin, which are mostly related to
RNA, folding, stress and localization (Fig. 4F, Fig. S5B). 61 pathway categories unique to
thapsigargin almost exclusively represented metabolic and biosynthetic pathways as shown for the top
20 overrepresented pathways containing up- or downregulated DEPs, suggesting that thapsigargin on
its own, unlike CoV infection, initiates a broad metabolic response (Fig. 4F, Fig. S5B).
This raised the question of whether the thapsigargin effects were retained in infected cells or,
alternatively, drug-sensitive pathway patterns were reprogrammed (or masked) by the virus infection.
To address this point, we pooled all pathways enriched under virus+thapsigargin conditions and
compared them to virus infection or thapsigargin alone. 53% (132 out 248) pathway terms were shared
by these three conditions reflecting multiple stress-related, catabolic and RNA regulatory processes
(Fig. 4G, H). 21 pathway terms were unique to the virus+thapsigargin situation. They primarily
mapped to specific splicing, signaling (TORC, RHOA, ARF3) and transport/localization pathways
(Fig. 4G, H). The 34 categories shared by virus+thapsigargin and thapsigargin conditions but were not
detectable in cells infected with virus (only) recapitulate the thapsigargin-regulated metabolic
pathways (pyruvate, aldehyde, carbohydrate, amino/nucleotide sugar, amino acid and glutamine

metabolism, TCA cycle, ERAD pathway, N-linked glycosylation) (Fig. 4G, H). For several of these
pathways (e.g. ERAD, heat stress, carbohydrate metabolism), some DEPs were induced while others
were repressed, indicating remodeling of pathway functions at the protein level (Fig. 4G, H). The 53
pathway terms that were absent in the virus+thapsigargin group of terms (groups 27, 9, 17 of the Venn
diagram shown in Fig. 4G) represent a distinct set of terms, mostly related to nucleotide and DNArelated processes, such as DNA repair, DNA unwinding, chromatin silencing (Fig. 4G, H). In
summary, the functional analysis of DEPs at the level of differentially enriched pathway categories
shows that the antiviral effects of thapsigargin strongly correlate with the activation / suppression of a
range of metabolic programs.
The enriched pathway terms provided important overarching information on shared and unique
biological processes but not necessarily encompassed identical sets of DEPs as exemplified by the ten
pathways shown in Fig. 4I. We therefore refined our analysis to the individual component level to
identify proteins with similar regulation between both viruses across both cell types. The proteomes of
HuH7 and Vero E6 cells overlap by 57 % (Fig. 5A). In this group, only 43 identical proteins were
found to be deregulated by both MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 (Fig. 5B, left Venn diagrams).
However, under thapsigargin+virus conditions, 108 proteins were upregulated and 61 proteins were
downregulated, respectively (Fig. 5B, right Venn diagrams). Using the example of the top 50 DEPs,
it becomes apparent that the majority of proteins are regulated in the same direction by thapsigargin
alone; demonstrating that thapsigargin largely overrides any virus-induced modulation of host
processes (Fig. 5C).
In the absence of thapsigargin, the virus infection generally has little or opposite effects on the levels
of the 108 proteins, as exemplified by the suppression seen for BiP (HSPA5) or HERPUD1 (Fig. 5C,
highlighted in green). The 108 induced factors map to pathways involving COPI-mediated
anterograde transport, ER stress, organelle organization and apoptosis (Fig. 5D). Across their pathway
annotations, 59 out of the 108 proteins were reported to strongly interact, thus probably being involved
in protein:protein networks that coordinate activities of the enriched pathways (Fig. 5E, left graph).
Likewise, the 61 repressed proteins map to specific (though different) pathways, such as fatty acid
degradation or viral life cycle (Fig. 5D). 26 components can be allocated to a few small protein
interaction networks (Fig. 5E, right graph).
We then validated mass spectrometry data by immunoblotting, confirming the induction of HERPUD1
in thapsigargin-treated cells infected individually with each of the three CoVs (Fig. 5F, G). We also
confirmed an additional hit belonging to the enriched pathways GO:0006520 (cellular amino acid
metabolic process) and GO:0034976 (response to endoplasmic reticulum stress, as shown in Fig.
4G, H), cystathionine-γ-lyase (CTH), a regulator of glutathione homeostasis and cell survival (Lee et
al, 2014), as a further independent example for the fidelity and robustness of the proteomics data (Fig.
5F, G).
The highly inducible HERPUD1 protein has an essential scaffolding function for the organization of
components of the core ER-associated protein degradation (ERAD) complex (Leitman et al, 2014;
Okuda-Shimizu & Hendershot, 2007). ER quality control (ERQC) and ERAD pathways are critically
involved in the qualitative and quantitative control of misfolded or excessively abundant proteins in
the ER. If protein folding in the ER fails, the proteins are retro-translocated through a HERPUD1dependent ER membrane complex to the cytosol for proteasomal degradation (Behnke et al, 2015). By
searching our proteomics data for further ERAD factors we were able to retrieve a total of 34 (for
MERS-CoV) and 20 (for SARS-CoV-2) proteins of the canonical ERQC and ERAD pathways for

which a differential expression was observed in virus-infected cells treated with thapsigargin (Fig.
5H). Mapping of these data on the KEGG 04141 pathway suggests that thapsigargin enhances or
restores these mechanisms at key nodes of ERQC and ERAD in coronavirus-infected cells (Fig. S6).
We also intersected the 108+59 proteins jointly regulated by thapsigargin in MERS-CoV and SARSCoV-2 infected cells with data from a recent genome-wide sgRNA screen that reported new ERAD
factors required for protein degradation (Leto et al, 2019). This analysis identified 31 additional
thapsigargin-regulated factors that may further support antiviral ERAD, including UBA6 and ZNF622,
which were recently described either as negative regulators of DNA virus infections or of autophagy,
the latter process playing diverse roles during CoV infection (Fig. 5I) (Jia & Bonifacino, 2020; Maier
& Britton, 2012; Mun & Punga, 2019).
In conclusion, these data show that thapsigargin forces the (re)expression of a dedicated network of
proteins with roles in ER stress, ERQC, ERAD, and a range of metabolic pathways. Collectively, these
changes at the protein level confer an “antiviral state” and profoundly suppress CoV replication as
summarized schematically in Fig. 5J.
Discussion
In this study, we report a potent inhibitory effect of the chemical thapsigargin on the replication of
three human CoVs in three different cell types. Following up on observations that CoVs globally
suppress UPR/ER stress factors, we find that thapsigargin counteracts the CoV-induced
downregulation of BiP, HERPUD1 (and CTH) and increases IRE1α levels. In this context,
thapsigargin also plays a role in overcoming the coronavirus-induced block of global protein
biosynthesis. Proteome-wide data revealed a thapsigargin-mediated reprogramming of metabolic
pathways and helped to identify a network of specific thapsigargin-regulated factors, including
candidates from the ERQC/ERAD pathways that, most likely, are involved in the destruction of viral
proteins. The positive effects of prolonged thapsigargin treatment on the expression of cellular BiP
and HERPUD1 are well documented (Kokame et al, 2000; Li et al, 1993; Ma & Hendershot, 2004;
Sun et al, 2015). Thus, the key finding of our study is that the thapsigargin-mediated induction of ER
factors overrides suppressive effects of CoVs on ER functions, as illustrated here for BiP, IRE1α and
HERPUD1, but also at the global proteomic scale.
BiP is one of the most abundant cellular proteins (also in our mass spectrometry data) and plays
essential roles in development and disease (Wang et al, 2017; Zhu & Lee, 2015). In yeast, the
inducible expression of the BiP homologue Karp2 is particularly essential for disposing of toxic
proteins and reducing cellular stress (Hsu et al, 2012). Hence a reduction of BiP levels (as seen during
CoV infection) and the contrary effect of thapsigargin-mediated upregulation are likely to have
opposing consequences on cell fate upon infection. Similarly, IRE1α is suggested to mediate
protective and adaptive responses suitable to alleviate ER stress, e.g. by balancing lipid bilayer stress,
an aberrant perturbation of ER membrane structures, which may be expected to occur upon DMV
formation in CoV-infected cells (Chen & Brandizzi, 2013; Halbleib et al, 2017; Snijder et al., 2020).
Accordingly, high levels of BiP, HERPUD1 and IRE1α may increase in general the resilience of cells
when infected by diverse pathogens. In line with this, our data show that, in cells infected with
representative coronaviruses, a protective ER response is initially elicited at the mRNA level (Fig. 1C
and (Poppe et al., 2017)). However, the global suppression at the protein level (or the lack of
induction) indicates that CoVs have evolved strategies at the posttranscriptional or translational level
to escape the protective antiviral activities of BiP, IRE1α and HERPUD1.

Together with PERK, all three proteins are key regulators of ERQC/ERAD pathways and ample
evidence shows that their expression, regulation and activities are intimately linked (Hetz & Papa,
2018; Karagoz et al., 2019). A recent study reported that PERK activation induces the RPAP2
phosphatase, inactivates IRE1α kinase activity and aborts IRE1α-mediated adaptive functions in
response to the chemical stressor Brefeldin A (Chang et al, 2018). In another report, high BiP levels
exerted negative control of IRE1α by direct binding the kinase or by promoting IRE1α degradation
(Chang et al., 2018; Sepulveda et al, 2018). Here, we show a different scenario, in which high BiP and
IRE1α protein levels coincide with an antiviral state as well as with improved metabolic functions,
suggesting unique modes of cross regulation of PERK, BiP and IRE1α in CoV-infected cells exposed
to chemical stress.
The regulation of HERPUD1 and several ERAD factors by thapsigargin provides an additional layer
of control contributing to the rapid suppression of CoV proteins. While ERAD is generally considered
to dispose of unwanted proteins in the ER (Brodsky, 2012; Christianson et al, 2012), a process called
“ERAD tuning” has been suggested to segregate ERAD components and thereby positively contribute
to replicative organelle formation in RNA virus infections (Byun et al, 2014; Noack et al, 2014). Our
data are compatible with a model in which a modulation of ERAD by small molecules may antagonize
“ERAD tuning”, thereby preserving normal ERAD-mediated degradation.
Clearly, the mechanistic basis for these effects remains to be identified in additional studies. The
proteomic data show that thapsigargin affects multiple pathways beyond the core ER stress response.
They also indicate that it will not be trivial to identify the essential targets that mediate thapsigargin’s
antiviral effects. Our data provide a rich resource for further drug target analysis, also in conjunction
with the few deep protein sequencing studies available for SARS-CoV-2 (but not MERS-CoV)
(Bojkova et al, 2020; Bouhaddou et al, 2020; Grenga et al, 2020; Stukalov et al, 2020). Our study fills
an important knowledge gap by providing a direct side-by-side comparison of pharmacologically
targeted cells infected with two highly pathogenic human coronaviruses.
In the absence of effective therapeutic and prophylactic strategies (antivirals and vaccines) to combat
coronaviruses, and in view of the current SARS-CoV-2 pandemic, we report these observations to
invite other laboratories to embark on a broader investigation of this potential therapeutic avenue.
Given that thapsigargin concentrations in the lower nanomolar range were shown to abolish CoV
replication in cultured cells, even when added later in infection (8 h p.i.), this work identifies
thapsigargin as an interesting drug candidate. The Ca2+ mobilizing and cytotoxic features of plantderived thapsigargin have been studied for 40 years (Andersen et al, 2015; Patkar et al, 1979). Several
analogues have already been designed and efficient and scalable purification or synthesis is now
available for application in humans (Chu et al, 2018; Chu et al, 2017; Lopez et al, 2018). Recently, a
protease-cleavable prodrug of thapsigargin, mipsagargin, has been evaluated in phase I and II clinical
trials for prostate cancer (Doan et al, 2015; Mahalingam et al, 2019; Mahalingam et al, 2016; Patkar et
al., 1979). It is not uncommon to adapt anti-proliferative cytostatic drugs (e.g. azathioprine,
cylophosphamid, methotrexate) for the treatment of autoimmune and inflammatory disorders by
applying lower doses than those needed for treating cancer (Marder & McCune, 2007). Similarly, low
doses of thapsigargin combined with short term systemic or topical application in the airways might
reduce viral load early on or in critically ill patients with a favorable therapeutic index with respect to
antiviral versus cytotoxic effects. CoV also activate inflammatory, NF-κB-dependent cytokine and
chemokines at the mRNA level (Poppe et al., 2017), some of which (CXCL2, CCL20) escape
translational shut-down and are secreted in a cell-type specific manner (Fig. S7). Some of these
cytokines may contribute to the cytokine storm observed in some COVID-19 patients (Mehta et al,

2020). While thapsigargin had no effect on IL-8, IL-6, CXCL2 and CCL20 in cell culture (Fig. S7), a
single bolus of the compound was shown to efficiently reduce the translation of pro-inflammatory
cytokines in preclinical models of sepsis (Wei et al, 2019). Thus, an additional benefit of thapsigargin
treatment may arise from dampening overshooting tissue inflammation in COVID-19 patients. In
summary, the study provides several lines of evidence that thapsigargin hits a central mechanism of
CoV replication, which may be exploited to develop novel therapeutic strategies. This compound or
derivatives with improved specificity, pharmacokinetics and safety profiles may also turn out to be
valuable to mitigate the consequences of potential future CoV epidemics more effectively.

Fig.1. CoVs uncouple mRNA and protein levels of ER stress components in infected cells.
HuH7 cells were left untreated or were infected with HCoV-229E or MERS-CoV (MOI=1) for 3, 6,
12, or 24 h. Transcriptomic data (by RNA-seq, n=2) and proteomic data (by LC-MS/MS, n=2, three
technical replicates per sample) were derived from samples obtained at the indicated time points p.i.
and subsequently used to extract expression values for the KEGG pathway 04141 “protein processing
in endoplasmic reticulum”.
(A) Scatter plots show mean normalized protein / mRNA expression values for each component, fitted
linear regression lines, confidence intervals and correlation coefficients for mock-infected HuH7 cells
and HuH7 cells infected for 24 h.
(B) Correlation matrix of Pearson’s r across all conditions. All p values are given in supplementary
Table S1.
(C) The heatmap shows mean ratio values of differentially expressed mRNAs or proteins based on
significant differences (fold change ≥ 2, p ≤ 0.01) calculated from the two biological replicates. See
also Fig. S1 and Table S1.

(C) HuH7 cells were left untreated or infected with HCoV-229E (MOI=1) for 24 h and treated with
thapsigargin (1 µM) according to (B). Supernatants and RNA-isolated from the cell pellets were used
to determine viral titers (upper graphs) and expression of HCoV-229E S gene-containing RNA (lower
graphs).
(D) Representative fluorescence microscopy images showing subcellular HCoV-229E replication sites
(at 24 h p.i.) identified by nsp8- or double-strand RNA-specific antibodies in the presence or absence
of thapsigargin. Cells were infected with virus and treated with thapsigargin (1 µM) for 24 h.
(E) Total cell extracts from HuH7 cells infected with HCoV-229E (MOI=1) and treated with
thapsigargin (1 µM) as shown in (B) were analyzed for the expression/modification of the indicated
host cell and viral proteins by immunoblotting.
(F) Quantification of immunoblot data from multiple experiments.
(G) HuH7 cells were left untreated, or were infected with HCoV-229E (MOI=1) in the presence /
absence of increasing concentrations of thapsigargin or DMSO as solvent control. After 24 h, cell
viability was assessed by MTS assay.
(H) Data from (G) were used to compute half maximal cellular cytotoxicity (CC50) concentrations of
thapsigargin.
(I) HuH7 cells were treated and infected according to (B). 30 min before harvesting, puromycin (3
µM) was added to the cells as indicated. Total cell extracts were analyzed by immunoblotting. The
blot membrane was stained with CBB to assess the steady state proteomes and then hybridized with
anti-puromycin antibodies to detect de novo synthesized nascent polypeptides. The upper graphs show
representative images and the lower graph shows the quantification of multiple replicates. Puromycin
signals of each lane were normalized to the corresponding CBB staining and were background
corrected by subtracting signals of samples in which puromycin had been omitted.
Data points show values from independent biological replicates, error bars show s.d..

Fig. 3. Thapsigargin inhibits the replication of high- and low-pathogenic human coronaviruses in
multiple cell types.
(A-D) Human embryonic MRC-5 lung fibroblasts were infected with HCoV-229E according to the
scheme shown in Fig. 1B. Viral titers (A, upper graph), and expression of viral S gene-containing
RNAs (A, lower graph), viral and host cell proteins (B, C) and cell viability (D) were analyzed and
quantified as described in the legend of Fig. 1.
(E- K) Similarly, HuH7 cells or Vero E6 African green monkey kidney epithelial cells were infected
with MERS-CoV (MOI=0.5) or SARS-CoV-2 (MOI=0.5) for 12 h or 24 in the presence / absence of
0.4 µM or 1 µM thapsigargin.
(E, F) show viral titers and (G, H) the corresponding expression of MERS-CoV / SARS-CoV-2
nucleocapsid (N) and host cell proteins, respectively.
(I) Dose-dependent suppression of MERS-CoV-2 replication by thapsigargin (upper graph) and the
estimated effective inhibitory concentration (EC50) in HuH7 cells infected with an MOI of 0.5 (lower
graph).
(J) Dose-dependent suppression of SARS-CoV-2 replication by thapsigargin (left graph) and the
calculated effective inhibitory concentration (EC50) in Vero E6 cells infected with an MOI of 0.5 (right
graph).
(K) The CC50 of thapsigargin in Vero E6 cells was calculated by MTS assays as described in the
legend of Fig. 2G-H.
Data points show values from independent biological replicates, error bars show s.d..
Asterisks indicate p values (*p ≤ 0.05, **p ≤ 0.01, ***p ≤ 0.001, **** p ≤ 0.0001) obtained by twotailed unpaired t-tests.
See Fig. S2 for quantifications from replicates for MERS-CoV / SARS-CoV-2 immunoblot
experiments.
Fig. 4. Proteome profiling of thapsigargin effects on MERS-CoV or SARS-CoV-2-infected cells
reveals multiple virus- and thapsigargin-specific protein and pathway patterns.
(A-D) Total cell extracts from uninfected cells (-), HuH7 cells infected with MERS-CoV (M,
MOI=0.5) for 12 h (A) or 24 h (B), or Vero E6 cells infected with SARS-CoV-2 (S, MOI=0.5) for 12
h (C) or 24 h (D), in the presence or absence of thapsigargin (T, 1 µM) were subjected to LC-MS/MS
analysis. In total, 5,372 (from HuH7) or 5,072 (from Vero E6 cells) majority protein IDs were
identified. Quantile-normalized log2-tranformed protein intensities were used for all further
calculations. Volcano plots show the distribution of pairwise ratio comparisons and the corresponding
p values which were obtained by pooling data from two independent experiments and from three
technical replicates per sample. Blue and red colors indicate differentially expressed proteins (DEPs,
ratio > 0, p ≥ -log10 1.3). Purple and light red colors indicate individual viral proteins.
(E) Scheme of multiple gene ID lists (corresponding to the DEPs shown in (A)-(D)) that were used for
overrepresentation analyses to identify the top 100 enriched pathway categories per virus and time
point using Metascape software (Zhou et al., 2019). Complete lists of pathways are shown in Fig. S3
and S4 as clustered heatmaps. The top 5 enriched pathway categories for up- or downregulated DEPs
are shown in Fig. S5A.
(F, G) The 400 enriched pathway categories were pooled and filtered for common and distinct
pathways considering only terms with enrichment p values ≤ log10 -3.
(F) Venn diagram showing pathway terms specific to MERS-CoV (M), SARS-CoV-2 (S) or
thapsigargin (T). The top 20 enriched pathway categories are shown in Fig. S5B.

(A) Venn diagram demonstrating the overlap of orthologues proteins expressed in HuH7 and Vero
cells based on the NCBI gene IDs corresponding to majority protein IDs.
(B) The overlap of virus- and thapsigargin-regulated proteins common to HuH7 and Vero E6 cells was
calculated based on gene IDs. This analysis identifies 180 proteins with higher and 61 proteins with
lower expression in thapsigargin-treated infected cells compared to virus infection alone (ratio > 0, p
≥ -log10 1.3).
(C) Heatmaps showing individual mean ratio values of log2-transfomed normalized protein intensities
for the top 50 up- or downregulated proteins in virus-infected and thapsigargin-treated cells. Ratio
values of infected or thapsigargin-treated conditions compared to untreated cells (-) cells are shown for
comparison. Note that ratios are sorted and color coded according to the virus plus thapsigargin
conditions with infection alone conditions set as denominator. Green colors highlight HERPUD1 and
BiP (HSPA5) values. Orange colors highlight SQSMT1 which was also identified as SARS-CoV-2regulated protein in an independent study (Stukalov et al., 2020).
(D) Overrepresentation analysis showing the top 10 pathways mapping to gene IDs with increased
(180 proteins, red) or decreased (61 proteins, blue) expression levels in thapsigargin-treated and
infected cells compared to virus infection alone. Gene ID lists were analyzed using Metascape
software (Zhou et al., 2019).
(E) Experimental evidence, co-occurrence, co-expression and confidence scores from the STRING
database (Szklarczyk et al, 2019) were used to identify protein:protein interactions (PPI) amongst the
180 up- and 61 downregulated thapsigargin-sensitive proteins. As shown, based on experimental
evidence and combined STRING score criteria, 59 and 26 coregulated proteins are engaged in defined
PPI networks; the remaining proteins are not known to interact.

Materials and Methods
Cells and viruses
HuH7 human hepatoma cells (Japanese Collection of Research Bioresources (JCRB) cell bank;
(Nakabayashi et al, 1982)) were maintained in Dulbecco’s modified Eagle’s medium (DMEM,
including 3.7 g / l NaHCO3; PAN Biotech Cat No P04-03550) complemented with 10% filtrated
bovine serum (FBS Good Forte; PAN Biotech, Cat No. P40-47500), 2 mM L-glutamine (Gibco,
21935-028), 100 U / ml penicillin and 100 μg /ml streptomycin. MRC-5 human embryonic lung
fibroblasts ((ATCC, CCL-171) ) were maintained in DMEM containing 1.5 g / l (w / v) NaHCO3 and
complemented with 10% fetal calf serum (FCS; PAN Biotech Cat No. 1502-P110704), 2 mM Lglutamine, 100 U / ml penicillin and 100 μg / ml streptomycin, 1% minimum essential medium nonessential amino acids (100x MEM NEAA; Gibco Cat No 11140-035) and 1 mM sodium pyruvate (100
mM; Gibco 11360-039). Vero E6 African green monkey kidney epithelial cells (ATCC CRL-1586)
were grown in DMEM, 10% FBS, 100 U / ml penicillin and 100 μg /ml streptomycin. HuH7 and
MRC-5 cells were confirmed to be free of mycoplasma using the Venor® GeM Classic kit (Minerva
Biolabs).
Genome sequences of coronavirus strains used in this study are as follows: HCoV-229E (NCBI
accession number AF304460.1, NCBI reference sequence NC_002645.1), MERS-CoV (NCBI
accession number JX869059, NCBI reference sequence NC_019843.3). SARS-CoV-2 genome
sequencing data have been submitted to the NCBI Short Read Archive repository under bioproject
PRJNA658242 (SRA accession number SRP278165). MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 were kindly
provided by Christian Drosten.
Virus infections and assessments of antiviral activity
To analyze the antiviral activity of thapsigargin, HuH7 cells (for HCoV-229E, MERS-CoV), MRC-5
cells (for HCoV-229E) and Vero E6 (for SARS-CoV-2) were infected at the indicated multiplicities of
infection (MOI) and incubated at 33°C (for HCoV-229E and SARS-CoV-2) or 37°C (for MERS-CoV)
in the presence or absence of thapsigargin, or with the appropriate volume of solvent control (DMSO)
as indicated. At 24 h p.i., supernatants were collected and stored at -80 °C. Virus titers in the
supernatants were determined by plaque assay. HCoV-229E was titrated on HuH7 cells seeded on 12well plates. MERS-CoV was titrated on HuH7 cells seeded on 24-well plates, and SARS-CoV-2 was
titrated on Vero E6 cells seeded on 24-well plates using standard procedures. Briefly, confluent
monolayers of the appropriate cells were incubated with serial dilutions of virus-containing
supernatants (diluted 101 to 107) and incubated at 33°C (HCoV-229E, SARS-CoV-2) or 37°C (MERSCoV). After 1 h, the virus inoculum was replaced with fresh medium (MEM, Gibco) containing 1.25%
Avicel® (FMC Biopolymer, #RC591 ), 100 U/ml penicillin, 100 μg/ml streptomycin, and 10% FBS or
FCS. At 48 h p.i. (for MERS-CoV) or 72 h p.i. (for SARS-CoV-2 and HCoV-229E), cell culture
supernatants were removed. Cells were washed with PBS and fixed in freshly prepared 3.7% PFA in
PBS overnight. Next, the fixing solution was removed, the cell layer was washed with PBS and
stained with 0.15% (w/v) crystal violet (diluted in 20% Ethanol) and plaques were counted. For EC 50
calculation, virus titers determined for virus-infected cells treated with DMSO only (no inhibitor) were
used for normalization. EC50 values were calculated by non-linear regression analysis using GraphPad
Prism 5.0 or 8.4.3 (GraphPad Software). All virus work was performed in biosafety level 2 (BSL-2;
HCoV-229E) or biosafety level 3 (BSL-3; MERS-CoV, SARS-CoV-2) containment laboratories
approved for such use by the local authorities (RP Giessen, Germany).
Materials
Thapsigargin (Cayman Chemicals; Cay10522-1) was dissolved in DMSO as a 10 mM stock solution.
Appropriate DMSO concentrations served as vehicle controls in some experiments. The following

anti rabbit (rb) IgG (dk, Merck Millipore, #AP182C), Dylight 488-coupled anti mouse (ms) IgG (dk,
ImmunoReagent, #DkxMu-003D488NHSX),
Cell lysis, in vivo puromycinylation, and immunoblotting
For whole cell extracts, samples derived from experiments performed with HCoV-229E were lysed in
Triton cell lysis buffer (10 mM Tris,pH 7.05, 30 mM NaPPi, 50 mM NaCl, 1% Triton X-100, 2 mM
Na3VO4, 50 mM NaF, 20 mM ß-glycerophosphate and freshly added 0.5 mM PMSF, 2.5µg/ml
leupeptin, 1.0 µg/ml pepstatin, 1 µM microcystin). After 10-15 min on ice, lysates were cleared by
centrifugation at 15,000 x g for 15 min at 4°C. Protein concentrations of supernatants were determined
by Bradford assay and samples stored at -80 °C.
To label nascent polypeptides in intact cells (Iwasaki & Ingolia, 2017), HuH7 cells were seeded in 6
cm cell culture dishes (3 × 105 cells) and treated as described in the figure legends. Thirty minutes
prior to harvest, the medium was supplemented with 3 µM puromycin (InvivoGen, #ant-pr-1). Then,
cells were lysed as described above. After immunoblotting (see below), membranes were stained with
Coomassie brilliant blue and then hybridized with an anti puromycin antibody (Kerafast, #EQ0001) to
detect puromycinylated polypetides.
Total cell lysates of MERS-CoV- and SARS-CoV-2-infected cells used for immunoblotting or mass
spectrometry were prepared as follows. Cells were scraped in ice-cold PBS and pelleted at 500 x g for
5 min at 4°. Cell pellets were washed in ice-cold PBS and stored in liquid N2 (or lysed and processed
immediately). After thawing, cell pellets (corresponding to ≈ 300.000 cells seeded in 60 mm dishes at
the start of the experiment) were resuspended in 90 µl of ice-cold Ca2+ / Mg2+ -free PBS and
transferred to fresh tubes. After addition of 10 µl of 10% SDS, samples were heated at 100 °C for 10
min and centrifuged at 600 x g for 1 minute at room temperature. Supernatants were transferred to a
fresh tube and heated again at 100°C for 10 minutes and centrifuged at 600 x g for 1 minute at room
temperature. Protein concentrations were determined with the detergent compatible Bradford assay kit
(Pierce™, #23246) using a 150-fold dilution. Aliquots corresponding to 20-25 µg protein (per lane)
were mixed with 4 x SDS sample buffer (ROTI®Load, Roth, #K929) and stored at -20 °C prior to
SDS-PAGE, or loaded immediately. Cell lysates were subjected to SDS-PAGE on 8-10% gels. The
PageRuler™ prestained protein ladder (Thermo Scientific, #26616) was used as Mr marker.

Immunoblotting was performed essentially as described (Hoffmann et al, 2005). Proteins were
separated on SDS-PAGE and electrophoretically transferred to PVDF membranes (Roti-PVDF, #T830
Roth). Membranes were stained with 0,1 % (w/v) Ponceau S (Sigma) dissolved in 5% acetic acid or
Coomassie brilliant blue to confirm transfer and equal loading of proteins. After blocking with 5%
dried milk in Tris-HCl-buffered saline/0.05% Tween (TBST) for 1 h, membranes were incubated for
12-24 h with primary antibodies, washed in TBST and incubated for 1-2 h with the peroxidasecoupled secondary antibody. Proteins were detected by using enhanced chemiluminescence (ECL)
systems from Millipore or GE Healthcare. Images were acquired with the ChemiDoc TouchImaging
System (BioRad) and quantified using the software ImageLab (versions V_5.2.1 or V_6.0.1, Bio-Rad).
mRNA expression analysis by RT-qPCR
0.5 - 1 µg of total RNA was prepared by column purification (MachereyNagel) and transcribed into
cDNA using Moloney murine leukemia virus reverse transcriptase (RevertAid Reverse Transcriptase,
Thermo Fisher Scientific, #EP0441) in a total volume of 10 or 20 µl. 1 or 2 µl of this reaction
mixture was used to amplify cDNAs using Taqman assays on demand (0.25 or 0.5 µl) (Applied
Biosystems/Thermo Fisher Scientific) for GUSB (81 bp, Hs99999908_m1), IL6 (95 bp,
Hs00174131_m1), IL8 (101 bp, Hs0017 4103_m1), CXCL2 (68 bp, Hs00236966_m1), and CCL20 (81
bp, Hs00171125_m1), as well as TaqMan Fast Universal PCR Master Mix (Applied Biosystems/
Thermo Fisher Scientific). Alternatively, primer pairs were designed and used with 2 µl of cDNA and
Fast SYBR Green PCR Master Mix (Applied Biosystems/Thermo Fisher Scientific) to detect the
mRNA of EIF2AK3 (encoding PERK) (fw5'-AGAGATTGAGACTGCGTGGC-3',
re 5'-TCCCAAATACCTCTGGTTTGCT-3') and of HCoV-229E S RNA (fw5‘TTTCAGGTGATGCTCACATACC-3‘, re 5‘-ACAAACTCACGAACTGTCTTAGG-3‘). All PCRs
were performed in duplicate on an ABI 7500 real-time PCR instrument. The cycle threshold value (ct)
for each individual PCR product was calculated by the instrument’s software, and the ct values
obtained for inflammatory/target mRNAs were normalized by subtracting the ct values obtained for
GUSB. The resulting Δct values were also used to calculate relative changes of mRNA expression as
ratio (R) of mRNA expression of treated / untreated cells according to the following equation: R=2-((Δct
treated)-(Δct untreated))
.
Immunofluorescence
Cells were seeded for in µ-slides VI (Ibidi) and pre-cultured at 37°C, 6 % CO2. Virus infection as well
as simultaneous thapsigargin treatment (1 µM) was performed for 24 h at 33°C, 6% CO2. After 2x
washing, cells were fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde in PBS (Santa Cruz, #281692) for 5 min, washed
3x 10 min with Hank’s BSS (PAN, #P04-32505), blocked with 10% normal donkey serum (Jackson
ImmunoResearch, #017-000-121) for 20 min and incubated with primary and secondary antibodies
diluted in Hank’s BSS containing 0.005% saponin (Sigma-Aldrich, #S4521-10G) for 2 h at room
temperature. Following 3 washing steps with Hank’s BSS containing 0.005% saponin, Cy3-conjugated
(Millipore, #AP182C, 1:100) and Dylight488-conjugated (ImmunoReagents #DkxMu003D488NHSX, 1:100) secondary antibodies were used. For controls, primary antibodies were
omitted. Nuclei were stained with Hoechst 33342 (Invitrogen). Immunofluorescence images were
analyzed using Leica DMi8 and the Leica LASX software. For double immunofluorescence analyses
appropriate filter cubes were used (Dylight488: excitation 480/40 and emission 527/30, Cy3:
excitation 560/40 and emission 630/75, as well as counterstaining with Hoechst 33342: excitation
405/60 and emission 470/50).

MTS assays of HCoV-229E experiments were performed using the The CellTiter 96® AQueous One
Solution Cell Proliferation Assay kit (Promega, #G3582). In brief, 1.2 x 104 HuH7 or 1 x 104 MRC-5
cells were seeded in 96-well plates for 24 hours and thereafter treated with DMSO, thapsigargin, virus
alone or virus plus thapsigargin for 24 hours as indicated in the figure legends. Then, the medium was
replaced by 100 µl complete cell culture medium including 20 µl CellTiter 96® AQueous one solution
reagent according to the manufacturer’s recommendations. Cells were further incubated for 0.5 - 1
hour at 33° C. Then, absorbance values were measured at 490 nm. Control wells containing only
medium were used to correct for background absorbance.
For MTT assay, Vero E6 cells seeded at near confluency were incubated with a serial dilution of
thapsigargin in a 96-well format. After 24 h, 200 µl MTT mix (DMEM supplemented with 10% FCS
containing 250µg/ml tetrazolium bromide, Sigma) was added to each well. Next, cells were incubated
for 90-120 min at 37°C and fixed using 3.7% PFA in PBS. The tetrazolium crystals were dissolved by
adding 200 µl/well isopropanol and the absorbance at 490 nm was measured using an ELISA reader
(BioTek). To determine CC50 values, the MTT values were calculated in relation to the untreated
control (which was set to 100%). CC50 values were then calculated by non-linear regression using
GraphPadPrism 5.0 (GraphPad Software).
ELISA
Sandwich ELISAs from R&D Systems (DuoSet ELISA for human IL-8 (DY208), IL-6 (DY206),
CXCL2 DY276-05, CCL20 (DY360)) were used to measure secreted human cytokine /chemokine
protein concentrations in cell culture supernatants of HuH7 or MRC-5 cells treated as described in the
figure legends. The cell culture supernatants were harvested, centrifuged at 15,000 × g at 4°C for 15 s
and stored at -80°C. 100 µl of the supernatants were either used undiluted or were diluted in cell
culture medium as follows (HuH7: IL-8 (1:10), CXCL2 (1:3), CCL20 (1:8), MRC-5: IL-8 (1:10), IL-6
(1:20), CXCL2 (1:1.5)) and ELISAs were performed according to the manufacturer’s instructions
using serial dilutions of recombinant proteins as standards. All measurements were within the linear
range of the standard curve. In some experiments, an IL-1α (10 ng/ml) stimulation for 16 h was used
as positive control.
RNA-seq and bioinformatics
For the data shown in Fig.1, total RNA was isolated from uninfected and infected cells obtained at 3,
6, 12, 24 h p.i. (or mock infection) using two biological replicates resulting in 32 RNA-seq data sets.
RNA was sequenced (with rRNA depletion) using Illumina reagents and an Illumina HiSeq 4000
instrument (single read, 150 bases). Quality control of RNA-seq reads was performed using the
FastQC command line tool version 0.11.5
(https://www.bioinformatics.babraham.ac.uk/projects/fastqc/). Reads were aligned using STAR
version 2.4.2a (Dobin et al, 2013) to an index based on the human genome version hg19. The
resulting bam files were imported into R (Team, 2015) (https://www.R-project.org/) and gene-specific
read counts based on hg19 UCSC gene annotations were extracted using FeatureCounts from the R
subread package version 1.24.2 (Liao et al, 2013). Detection of differentially expressed genes was
done using DESeq2 version 1.14.1 (Love et al, 2014). From the entire data set, only normalized read
counts and ratio values for 166 gene IDs assigned to KEGG 04141 were extracted and further
analyzed.
Mass Spectrometry and bioinformatics
Protein extracts were lysed in SDS lysis buffer as described above. Prior to digestion, the SDS
containing solution was exchanged to 8 M urea applying the Filter-Aided Sample Preparation (FASP)
for proteome analysis protocol using Microcon YM-30 filter devices (Millipore, Cat. MRCF0R030)

(Wisniewski, 2018). Cysteines were alkylated with Iodoacetamide and 8 M urea buffer was exchanged
to 50 mM ammonium-bicarbonate buffer with a pH of 8.0. Samples were digested within the filter
devices by the addition of sequencing grade modified trypsin (Serva) and incubation at 37 °C overnight. Thereafter, the filter-units were transferred to fresh tubes. Peptides were eluted by the addition
of 50 µL 0.5 M NaCl solution and centrifugation (14.000 x g for 10 min). After drying the filtrates in a
vacuum concentrator (Speed Vac), pellets were resuspended in 25 µL of 0.1% formic acid.
Peptides were desalted and concentrated using Chromabond C18WP spin columns (Macherey-Nagel,
Part No. 730522). Finally, peptides were dissolved in 25 µl water with 5% acetonitrile and 0.1%
formic acid. The mass spectrometric analysis of the samples was performed using a timsTOF Pro mass
spectrometer (Bruker Daltonic). A nanoElute HPLC system (Bruker Daltonics), equipped with an
Aurora C18 RP column (25cm x 75µm) filled with 1.7 µm beads (IonOpticks) which was connected
online to the mass spectrometer. A portion of approximately 200 ng of peptides corresponding to 2 µl
was injected directly on the separation column. Sample loading was performed at a constant pressure
of 800 bar. Separation of the tryptic peptides was achieved at 50°C column temperature with the
following gradient of water/0.1% formic acid (solvent A) and acetonitrile/0.1% formic acid (solvent
B) at a flow rate of 400 nL/min: Linear increase from 2%B to 17%B within 60 minutes, followed by a
linear gradient to 25%B within 30 minutes and linear increase to 37% solvent B in additional 10
minutes. Finally B was increased to 95% within 10 minutes and hold for additional 10 minutes. The
built-in “DDA PASEF-standard_1.1sec_cycletime” method developed by Bruker Daltonics was used
for mass spectrometric measurement. Data analysis was performed using MaxQuant with the
Andromeda search engine and Uniprot databases were used for annotating and assigning protein
identifiers (Tyanova et al, 2016a). Perseus software (versions 1.6.10.50 and 1.6.14.0) was used for
further analyses (Tyanova et al, 2016b).
For the data shown in Fig.1, raw data from 47 LC-MS/MS runs (representing two independent
experiments and three technical replicates per sample for the 3 h, 6 h, 12 h, 24 h infection time points
with the exception of the MERS-CoV 24 h time point which has only five replicates) were mapped to
the Homo sapiens proteome (uniprot ID UP000005640). The normalized expression values assigned
to uninfected HuH7 cells were derived from a total of 59 mock samples representing multiple
technical repeats of two biological samples generated at each of the 3 h, 6 h, 12 h, 24 h time points in
order to generate a common reference sample for the mean protein expression found in uninfected /
untreated HuH7 cells. This mean reference was used to calculate all ratio values. From the entire data
set, only protein intensity values for 166 uniprot IDs assigned to KEGG 04141 were extracted,
quantile normalized and further analyzed using the software tools described below.
For the data shown in Fig. 4 and 5, raw data from 96 LC-MS/MS runs (representing two independent
experiments and three technical replicates per sample) were mapped to Homo sapiens (uniprot ID
UP000005640 for HuH7 cells), Chlorocebus sabaeus (Green monkey, Cercopithecus sabaeus, uniprot
ID UP000029965 for Vero E6 cells), MERS-CoV (uniprot IDs UP000139997 and UP000171868) or
SARS-CoV-2 (uniprot ID UP000464024) peptide sequences. All data sets were processed by
MaxQuant version 1.6.10.43 (raw data submission was done with version 1.6.17.0) (Tyanova et al.,
2016a) including the match between runs option enabled resulting in the identification of 5,372 (from
HuH7) or 5,072 (from Vero E6 cells) majority protein IDs. For further quantifications, log2transformed protein intensities were quantile normalized with Perseus (Tyanova et al., 2016b) and IDs
assigned to contaminants and reverse sequences were omitted. For calculation of ratio values between
conditions, the 2 x 6 replicates from each condition were assigned to one analysis group.
Differentially expressed proteins were identified from log2 transformed normalized protein intensity
values by Volcano plot analysis using Perseus functions. All subsequent filtering steps and heatmap
representations were performed in Excel 2016 as described in the figure legends. Venn diagrams were
created with tools provided at http://bioinformatics.psb.ugent.be/webtools/Venn/. Overrepresentation

analyses were done using the gene IDs / gene names of differentially enriched proteins and Metascape
software with the express settings (Zhou et al., 2019). Protein network data were extracted from the
most recent version of STRING (Szklarczyk et al., 2019) and visualized with Cytoscape 3.8.0 (Cline
et al, 2007). Mapping of ratio values on KEEG pathway 04141 was done with Pathview or Pathview
Web software (Luo et al, 2017).
Quantification and statistical analysis
Statistical parameters (t-tests, standard variations, confidence intervals, Pearson correlations) were
calculated using SigmaPlot 11, GraphPad Prism 5.0 or 8.4.3 or Microsoft Excel 2016 in addition to the
software tools mentioned above.
