The outbreak and spread of SARS-CoV-2 (Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome coronavirus 2), the cause of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), is a current global health emergency and
a prophylactic vaccine is needed urgently. The spike glycoprotein of SARS-CoV-2 mediates entry into host cells, and thus is a
target for neutralizing antibodies and vaccine design. Here we
show that adjuvanted protein immunization with SARS-CoV-2
spike trimers, stabilized in prefusion conformation 1 , results in
potent antibody responses in mice and rhesus macaques with
neutralizing antibody titers orders of magnitude greater than
those typically measured in serum from SARS-CoV-2 seropositive humans. Neutralizing antibody responses were observed
after a single dose, with exceptionally high titers achieved after
boosting. Furthermore, neutralizing antibody titers elicited by
a dose-sparing regimen in mice were similar to those obtained
from a high dose regimen. Taken together, these data strongly
support the development of adjuvanted SARS-CoV-2 prefusionstabilized spike protein subunit vaccines.

Introduction
As of 22nd July 2020, at least 15 million cases of SARSCoV-2 infection have been confirmed, with over 615,000
COVID-19 related deaths recorded 2 . Cases continue to
spread globally despite unprecedented public health measures and lockdowns. An effective prophylactic vaccine is
urgently required. Adjuvanted recombinant protein subunit
vaccines have excellent safety profiles and represent a proven
vaccine platform for eliciting protective immune responses
to viral infections, including human papillomavirus (HPV),
hepatitis B virus (HBV), and influenza A virus (IAV).
The spike glycoprotein of SARS-CoV-2 mediates receptor
binding and entry into target cells, and is the primary target for vaccine design. The receptor binding domain (RBD)
is a stable subunit within the spike glycoprotein (Fig. 1A)
responsible for ACE2 binding 3–7 , that can be expressed as
an independent domain 7–9 . While the RBD is a major target
for neutralizing antibodies 10–12 , antibodies specific for spike
epitopes outside of the RBD are also capable of neutralization 13,14 .

Results
To evaluate the use and immunogenicity of recombinant
protein subunit vaccines for SARS-CoV-2 we immunized
C57BL/6J mice (N=24) with either the spike ectodomain or
RBD, expressed in 293-F cells. The RBD domain was expressed as an Fc-fusion protein, which was cleaved and the
RBD subsequently purified by size-exclusion chromatography. The spike ectodomain was expressed as a prefusionstabilized variant with a C-terminal T4 trimerization domain,
and the introduction of two stabilizing Proline mutations in
the C-terminal S2 fusion machinery 1,15,16 . Highly pure and
homogenous spike glycoprotein trimers were obtained by
affinity purification followed by size-exclusion chromatography (Extended Data Fig. 1). Cryo-EM analysis of the spike
preparation demonstrated that it was well-folded and maintained in the trimeric, prefusion conformation 17 , consistent
with the original report 1 .
Mice were immunized with varying doses of antigen (range:
5 µg - 50 µg) in Addavax (InvivoGen), a squalene-based oilin-water emulsion analogous to MF59. MF59 is licensed,
safe and effective in humans 19 , and increases the immunogenicity of an influenza vaccine in the elderly 20 . Mice were
boosted twice, at 3-week intervals, beginning 4 weeks after prime (Fig. 1A). In both the low-dose (5 µg) and highdose (25 µg) groups, a single immunization with prefusionstabilized spike elicited a strong spike-specific IgG antibody
response, detected by ELISA (Extended Data Fig. 2), as early
as 4 weeks following the first immunization. RBD was less
immunogenic, with weak to no detectable responses after the
initial prime. However, seroconversion was evident in all
mice after the first boost with RBD.
To determine whether the antibody responses elicited were
neutralizing, we used a SARS-CoV-2 pseudotyped virus neutralization assay. In spike-immunized mice, neutralizing responses (ID50 100) were already detectable in four of ten
mice after a single dose (Fig. 1B and Extended Data Fig. 3).
All spike-immunized mice developed potent neutralizing antibody responses (median ID50 1,600) after the first boost,
which further increased in potency (median ID50 25,000) after the second boost. In contrast, RBD-immunized mice developed consistent neutralizing antibody responses only after the second boost, with a median ID50 neutralizing antiMandolesi and Sheward et al.

Fig. 1. Protein subunit vaccines elicit potent neutralizing antibodies in mice.
A. Two SARS-CoV-2 protein immunogens were evaluated: stabilized spike trimer,
and receptor binding domain (RBD). Mice (N=24) were immunized and humoral immune responses were followed longitudinally to compare stabilized spike vs RBD
immunogens at several doses. B. Serial dilutions of serum from immunized mice
were assessed for neutralization of SARS-CoV-2 pseudotyped lentiviruses harbouring a luciferase reporter gene, and the ID50 titers were calculated as the reciprocal
dilution where infection (RLU) was reduced by 50% relative to infection in the absence of serum. The geometric mean ID50 for each group is displayed. - (unimmunized mice - open circles); S+ (5µg stabilized spike - orange); S++ (25µg stabilized
spike - red); RBD+ (5µg RBD - cyan); RBD++ (25µg RBD - blue); RBD+++ (50µg
RBD - navy). ID50 titers below the limit of detection (45 or 90 depending on sample
availability) are displayed as 45. ID50 titers in seropositive donors (black) in Castro

body titer across all groups of 5,300. The substantial enhancement of the virus neutralizing activity observed after
the second RBD boost warrants further investigation. Across
all groups, spike-specific IgG titers correlated strongly with
pseudovirus neutralization, though neutralization was detectable only above a threshold EC50 (Extended Data Fig
5A). Interestingly, RBD medium (25 µg) and high (50 µg)
doses elicited neutralizing antibody responses with similar
ID50 values to those from the spike groups, but with a significantly flatter slope (p=0.0002), such that they were less
neutralizing at higher concentrations (see Extended Data Fig.
4). This could potentially be a result of epitopes on soluble RBD being subject to competition in the context of intact
spike trimer. This also suggests an additional advantage of
spike immunization over RBD alone, as incomplete neutralization may compromise sterilizing immunity.
Next, we immunized three rhesus macaques (Macaca mulatta) with adjuvanted trimeric prefusion-stabilized spike glycoprotein over approximately 4-week intervals (Fig. 2A),
and characterized the titers and kinetics of binding and neutralizing antibodies. Macaques were immunized intramuscularly with 100 µg of spike protein in 75 µg Matrix-M,
a saponin-based adjuvant developed for clinical use 21 (Novavax AB). Neutralizing antibody responses were already
detectable 2 weeks after a single dose (ID50 titers ranging
from 150-420) with titers retained at 4 weeks (Fig. 2C). Two
weeks after a first boost, the neutralizing antibody responses

were extremely potent, exceeding ID50 titers of 20,000 in
all three macaques. An additional boost 3 weeks later did
not raise the neutralization potency above that obtained with
just two immunizations, suggesting a third dose is not needed
to achieve highly potent neutralizing antibody responses following spike protein-based vaccination.
After two prefusion-stabilized spike protein immunizations,
geometric mean neutralizing antibody titers in macaques
were approximately two orders of magnitude more potent than that of sera from SARS-CoV-2 seropositive humans (Fig. 2C). These were also substantially higher than
those elicited by other immunization platforms that afforded
macaques partial or complete protection from challenge 22,23 .
In three recent phase I human trials, neutralizing antibody
titers elicited by mRNA or adenovirus-vectored vaccines
were similar to 24,25 or well below 26 those from convalescent
sera.
The spike-directed IgG binding titers elicited in the macaques
(Fig. 2B) correlated strongly with the virus neutralizing activity (R2 = 0.9478, Extended Data Fig. 5) and the rapid
development of potent virus neutralizing antibody responses
in macaques after a single dose suggested a minimal requirement for somatic hypermutation (SHM) of the response. This
is consistent with recent data showing that neutralizing monoclonal antibodies isolated from SARS CoV-2 convalescent
individuals display low levels of SHM 12,27,28 . The polyclonality, antibody germline VDJ usage, and level of SHM that
characterizes vaccine-induced SARS CoV-2 spike-induced
antibody responses will be a matter of interest, both in the
macaque model and in human vaccine trials.

Discussion
Neutralizing antibody titers have varied substantially across
different vaccine platforms. In animal models, inactivated
virus, DNA, and adenovirus-vectored vaccines elicited neutralizing antibody titers similar to or lower than those seen in
convalescent sera 22,23,29 . While high dose mRNA-based immunizations elicited potent neutralizing antibody responses
in mice 30 , neutralizing antibody titers elicited in phase I human trials were markedly lower 25 . Immunization of mice
with mRNA encoding stabilized spike led to reduced or undetectable viral loads in the lungs and nasal turbinates, in
a dose-dependent manner, and susceptible transgenic mice
were protected from lethal challenge 30 . Other preclinical
vaccine studies using genetic platforms elicited immune responses that protect against disease but not against infection.
For example, RBD- and spike-encoding DNA vaccines led
to reduced viral loads in the nose and lungs of challenged
macaques 22,23 .
Titers of neutralizing antibodies correlate strongly with protection in a number of vaccine settings 31–33 . For SARS-CoV2, passive transfer of neutralizing monoclonal antibodies provided partial or complete protection of animal models, in a
dose-dependent manner 11,34,35 . Here, we show in mice and
macaques that neutralizing antibody titers elicited by both
spike and RBD protein subunit immunization were orders
of magnitude higher than those we detected in SARS-CoVMandolesi and Sheward et al.

2 seropositive humans. This reinforces that vaccination can
induce more reliable immunity in the population than natural
infection. Since it is expected that binding and neutralizing
antibody titers decrease from their peak with time, high initial
titers will most likely translate into longer lasting protection.
At least 19 candidate SARS-CoV-2 vaccines have rapidly
entered clinical trials 36 . These include DNA and RNAbased platforms (Moderna 25 , Inovio, BioNTech/Pfizer 37 ),
adenovirus vectored vaccines (CanSino 26 , University of
Oxford/AstraZeneca 24 , Johnson & Johnson), inactivated
virus vaccines (Sinovac, Wuhan Institute of Biological Products, Beijing Institute of Biological Products),
and recombinant protein vaccines (Novavax 38 , Anhui
Zhifei Longcom Biopharmaceutical, Clover Biopharmaceuticals/GlaxoSmithKline). Given the urgency in the current
pandemic, vaccines will require rapid mobilization on a
global scale. As a result, safety is an important consideration, and the use of proven vaccine platforms (particularly
in the elderly) would be advantageous. DNA and RNA vaccines are amenable to large-scale and rapid vaccine manufacture; however, no nucleic acid or recombinant adenovirus
vaccines are approved for human use, and therefore remain
largely untested at scale.
Recombinant protein subunit vaccines have been developed
successfully for Influenza, HPV, and HBV, and are also being explored for SARS-CoV-2 vaccination, including three
candidate vaccines that have already entered phase I clinical
trials. Here we show in animal models (mice and macaques)
that immunization with RBD or prefusion-stabilized trimeric
SARS-CoV-2 spike proteins elicits potent neutralizing antibody responses. Further, we find that neutralizing responses

are more readily elicited and more potent with the stabilized
trimeric spike glycoprotein than with RBD. Importantly, we
show that neutralizing antibodies were elicited across animal
models, using different immunization routes and with different adjuvants, highlighting that the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein represents a robust immunogen. Importantly, significant
neutralizing antibody titers arose in non-human primates after a single dose with an adjuvanted spike subunit protein vaccine.
Production of prefusion-stabilized spike at an industrial scale
to meet global demand in a rapid time frame may be challenging. However, a number of groups have recently identified
additional stabilizing mutations and protocols that dramatically improve protein stability and expression yields 39–41 .
Further, we show in mice that a dose-sparing regimen with
5-fold less spike antigen elicited neutralizing antibodies at a
similar titer. The potential to leverage existing infrastructure
and manufacturing capacity for licensed vaccines could also
accelerate production and rollout.
Here we report that mice and macaques immunized with adjuvanted prefusion-stabilized spike developed potent neutralizing antibody responses. These are stronger than those previously reported to confer partial or complete protection in
animal models, and substantially more potent than those from
three recent phase I human trials of mRNA or adenovirusvectored vaccines 24–26 . Taken together, these results support the development of protein subunit vaccines to immunize
against SARS-CoV-2.

METHODS
Ethics statement: The animal work was conducted with the approval of the regional Ethical Committee on Animal Experiments (Stockholms Norra Djurförsöksetiska Nämnd). All animal procedures were performed according to approved
guidelines.
Protein production: The plasmid for expression of the SARS-CoV-2 prefusionstabilized spike ectodomain 1 was kindly provided by Jason McLellan. This plasmid
was used to transiently transfect freestyle 293-F cells using the FreeStyle MAX
reagent (Thermo Fisher Scientific). The spike ectodomain was purified from filtered
supernatant on Streptactin XT resin (IBA Lifesciences), followed by size-exclusion
chromatography on a Superdex 200 in 5 mM Tris pH 8, 200 mM NaCl.
The RBD domain (RVQ-VNF) of SARS-CoV-2 was cloned upstream of an enterokinase cleavage site and a human Fc. This plasmid was used to transiently transfect FreeStyle 293F cells using the FreeStyle MAX reagent. The RBD-Fc fusion
was purified from filtered supernatant on Protein G Sepharose (GE Healthcare)
and cleaved using bovine enterokinase (GenScript) leaving a FLAG-tag on the Cterminus of the RBD. Enzyme and Fc-portion was removed on His-Pur Ni-NTA resin
and Protein G Sepharose respectively, and the RBD was purified by size-exclusion
chromatography on a Superdex 200 in 5 mM Tris pH 8, 200 mM NaCl. Proteins
were re-buffered into PBS prior to immunization.
Mice: C57BL/6J (Jackson Laboratory) wild-type mice were housed and bred at
Karolinska Institutet animal facility. Immunogens were diluted in sterile PBS, emulsified in AddaVax (InvivoGen) and injected subcutaneously (s.c.) in the flanks of
mice. Each arm contained 5 mice, except the low-dose RBD group which had 4.
Two control mice were not immunized. Tail bleeds were taken prior to each immunization. Whole blood was allowed to clot at room temperature, and serum was
separated by centrifugation, heat inactivated at 56°C for 1 hour, and stored at -20°C
until use.
Macaques: Two female and one male rhesus macaques (Macaca mulatta) of
Chinese origin, 4-5 years old, were housed at the Astrid Fagraeus Laboratory at
Karolinska Institutet. Housing and care procedures complied with the provisions
and general guidelines of the Swedish Board of Agriculture. The facility has been
assigned an Animal Welfare Assurance number by the Office of Laboratory Animal Welfare (OLAW) at the National Institutes of Health (NIH). The macaques were
housed in groups in 14 m3 enriched cages. They were habituated to the housing
conditions for more than six weeks before the start of the experiment and subjected to positive reinforcement training in order to reduce the stress associated
with experimental procedures. All immunizations and blood samplings were performed under sedation with 10-15 mg/kg ketamine (Ketaminol 100 mg/ml, Intervet,
Sweden) administered intramuscularly (i.m.). The macaques were weighed at each
sampling. All animals were confirmed negative for simian immunodeficiency virus
(SIV), simian T cell lymphotropic virus, simian retrovirus type D and simian herpes
B virus.
For macaque immunizations, stabilized spike trimer (100 µg) was mixed in 75 µg of
Matrix-M (Novavax AB). Macaques were immunized intramuscularly (i.m.) with half
of the dose administered in each quadricep.
Mouse ELISAs: ELISA plates (Nunc MaxiSorp, Thermo Fisher Scientific) were
coated overnight at 4°C with 100 µl of prefusion-stabilized spike protein at a concentration of 1 µg/ml in 1x PBS. Plates were blocked for 90 minutes at room temperature with 200µl of a blocking solution containing 2%(w/v) non-fat milk powder
in 1X PBS, and washed 6 times with 1X PBS supplemented with 0.05% Tween
20 (PBS-T). Serum samples serially diluted in blocking solution were added and
plates were incubated overnight at 4°C. Plates were washed 6 times with PBS-T,
and 100µl of a goat anti-Mouse IgG horseradish peroxidase (HRP) conjugated secondary antibody (Southern Biotech) diluted 1:5,000 in PBS-T was added to each
well. Plates were washed 6 times with PBS-T, developed for 15 minutes at room
temperature using 200 µl per well of peroxidase substrate (o-phenylenediamine dihydrochloride, SIGMAFAST, SigmaAldrich), and read at 450 nm in an Asys Expert
96 plate reader (Biochrom). EC50 titers were calculated using a Bayesian logistic curve fitting approach, allowing plate-specific minimum and maximum sigmoid
parameters to account for differences between plates, and sample specific slope
and offset parameters. EC50 titers were calculated from the posterior median value
midway between the plate minimum and maximum.
Macaque ELISAs: ELISA plates were coated with prefusion-stabilized spike protein as above, washed, and blocked with 5%(w/v) non-fat milk powder in 1x PBS.
Thereafter, 10-fold serial dilutions (starting at 1:200) of plasma in blocking buffer
were added, and plates were incubated for 2 hours at room temperature. Plates
were washed and antibody-antigen interaction was detected using HRP-conjugated
anti-monkey IgG Fc (#GAMon/IgG(Fc)/PO Nordic MUbio) diluted 1:20,000 in PBST. Plates were developed using 50 µl of 3,3’,5,5"-tetramethylbenzidine substrate so-

lution (Invitrogen) per well and stopped using 50 µl of 1M sulphuric acid per well. OD
was read at 450nm in an Asys Expert 96 plate reader (Biochrom). Every washing
step was performed with 0.05% PBS-T. All experiments were conducted in triplicates. EC50 titers were calculated as for the mice.
Pseudotyped neutralization assays: Pseudotyped neutralization assays were
adapted from protocols previously validated to characterize the neutralization of
HIV 42 but with the use of HEK293T-ACE2 cells, as previously described 17 . All
cell lines were cultured in a humidified 37°C incubator (5% CO2) in Dulbecco’s
Modified Eagle Medium (Gibco) supplemented with 10% Fetal Bovine Serum and
1% Penicillin/Streptomycin, and were passaged when nearing confluency using 1X
Trypsin-EDTA. All cell lines tested negative for mycoplasma by PCR. Pseudotyped
lentiviruses displaying the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein (harboring an 18 amino acid
truncation of the cytoplasmic tail) and packaging a luciferase reporter gene were
generated by the co-transfection of HEK293T cells using Lipofectamine 3000 (Invitrogen) per the manufacturer’s protocols. Media was changed 12-16 hours after
transfection, and pseudotyped viruses were harvested at 48- and 72-hours post
transfection, filtered through a 0.45 µm filter, and stored at -80°C until use. Pseudotyped viruses sufficient to generate 100,000 RLUs were incubated with serial
dilutions of serum for 60 min at 37°C in a 96-well plate, and then 15,000 HEK293TACE2 cells were added to each well. Plates were incubated at 37°C for 48 hours,
and luminescence was then measured using Bright-Glo (Promega) per the manufacturer’s protocol, on a GM-2000 luminometer (Promega). ID50 titers were calculated as the reciprocal serum dilution at which RLUs were reduced by 50% relative
to control wells in the absence of serum.
