Abstract
Recently

severe

respiratory

coronavirus

2

(SARS-CoV-2) is the pathogen responsible for the ongoing coronavirus disease 2019
(COVID-19) pandemic. Currently, there is no vaccine available for preventing
SARS-CoV-2 infection. Like closely related severe acute respiratory syndrome
coronavirus (SARS-CoV), SARS-CoV-2 also uses its receptor-binding domain (RBD)
on the spike (S) protein to engage the host receptor, human angiotensin-converting
enzyme 2 (ACE2), facilitating subsequent viral entry. Here we report the
immunogenicity and vaccine potential of SARS-CoV-2 RBD (SARS2-RBD)-based
recombinant proteins. Immunization with SARS2-RBD recombinant proteins potently
induced a multi-functional antibody response in mice. The resulting antisera could
efficiently block the interaction between SARS2-RBD and ACE2, inhibit S-mediated
cell-cell fusion, and neutralize both SARS-CoV-2 pseudovirus entry and authentic
SARS-CoV-2 infection. In addition, the anti-RBD sera also exhibited cross binding,
ACE2-blockade, and neutralization effects towards SARS-CoV. More importantly, we
found that the anti-RBD sera did not promote antibody-dependent enhancement of
either

SARS-CoV-2

pseudovirus

entry

or

authentic

of

Fc

receptor-bearing cells. These findings provide a solid foundation for developing
RBD-based subunit vaccines for SARS-CoV2.

INTRODUCTION
In December 2019, the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID19), caused by a novel
coronavirus named severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2),
was first identified in Wuhan, China (Zhou et al., 2020; Zhu et al., 2020). Since then,
COVID19 cases have been increasingly reported in many countries and on March 11,
2020, the World Health Organization (WHO) declared COVID19 as a pandemic.
Although the symptoms associated with COVID19 are generally mild, approximately
20% of COVID19 patients may develop severe clinical manifestations such as
pneumonia, acute respiratory distress syndrome, sepsis and even death (Wu and
McGoogan, 2020). According to WHO, as of April 30, 2020, there are 3,090,445
confirmed

COVID19

cases

and

217,769

deaths

in

total

in

the

world

(https://www.who.int/docs/default-source/coronaviruse/situation-reports/20200430-sitr
ep-101-covid-19.pdf?sfvrsn=2ba4e093_2). Clearly, COVID19 is a serious public
health crisis. However, there is currently no vaccine available for COVID19.
SARS-CoV-2 belongs to the genus Betacoronavirus of the family Coronaviridae
(Gorbalenya et al., 2020). Like other coronaviruses, SARS-CoV-2 is an enveloped
virus and possesses a ~30 kb single-stranded positive-sense RNA genome. This viral
genome encodes 4 structural proteins including spike (S), envelope (E), membrane
(M), and nucleocapsid (N) proteins, 16 nonstructural proteins, and a few accessory
proteins (Wu et al., 2020). The S protein consists of an ectodomain, a transmembrane
domain, and a short intracellular tail (Walls et al., 2020). The ectodomain can be
further divided into two functionally distinct subunits, S1 and S2, which are
responsible for receptor binding and membrane fusion, respectively. Like the closely
related severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV), SARS-CoV-2
also uses human angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) as the key receptor to
facilitate its entry into host cells (Zhou et al., 2020). The S protein binds human ACE2
protein through its receptor-binding domain (RBD) located within the S1 subunit (Lan
et al., 2020; Shang et al., 2020; Wang et al., 2020b; Yan et al., 2020)
Many approaches have been tested for rapid development of SARS-CoV-2
vaccines, yielding some exciting results (Amanat and Krammer, 2020; Chen et al.,
3

2020). For example, Gao et al. recently reported that an inactivated whole-virus
vaccine provided protection in macaques against experimental SARS-CoV-2
challenge (Gao et al., 2020). Thus far, a number of SARS-CoV-2 vaccine candidates
derived from different vaccine platforms, including DNA vaccine, mRNA vaccine,
inactivated whole virus vaccine, and adenovirus-vectored vaccine, have rapidly
progressed into clinical trials (Amanat and Krammer, 2020; Callaway, 2020; Chen et
al., 2020).
One of the challenges in developing vaccines for coronaviruses is a potential
vaccine-induced immune enhancement of disease (Hotez et al., 2020; Huisman et al.,
2009). For example, immunization with inactivated whole-virus SARS-CoV vaccine
was found to elicit an immune response that exaggerate disease upon viral
challenges in animal models (Bolles et al., 2011; Luo et al., 2018; Tseng et al., 2012;
Wang et al., 2016). Results from some other studies suggest that antibodies targeting
the spike protein of coronaviruses play a major role in antibody-dependent
enhancement (ADE) likely through increasing the binding/entry of antibody-bound
virion to Fc receptor (FcR)-expressing cells (Corapi et al., 1992; Jaume et al., 2011;
Liu et al., 2019; Olsen et al., 1992; Wan et al., 2020; Wang et al., 2014; Yip et al.,
2014). So far, all the SARS-CoV-2 vaccine candidates entering clinical trials contain or
express full-length or near full-length S protein and therefore bear the risk of ADE.
Thus, it is important to continue the search for a safe and effective SARS-CoV-2
vaccine.
Recombinantly produced RBD proteins of SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV have been
shown to potently induce protective neutralizing antibodies against respective viruses
in preclinical studies and are therefore considered promising vaccine candidates
(reviewed in (Jiang et al., 2012; Zhou et al., 2018)). In the present study, we
investigated the vaccine potential of SARS-CoV-2 RBD (hereafter referred as
SARS2-RBD). We found that immunization of mice with recombinant SARS2-RBD
elicited the production of serum antibodies that efficiently neutralized both
SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV but did not promote ADE.

RESULTS
Mice immunized with RBD-Fc fusion protein produced SARS-CoV-2 neutralizing
antibodies
To rapidly evaluate the vaccine potential of SARS2-RBD, a pilot mouse
immunization study was performed with a recombinant RBD fusion protein containing
the Fc region of mouse IgG1 at the C-terminus (RBD-Fc) as the immunogen. The
mice received three vaccine doses at days 0, 8, and 13, respectively. The first vaccine
dose contained 100 μg of RBD-Fc protein, 500 μg of aluminum hydroxide and 25 μg
of CpG, the second one contained 50 μg of RBD-Fc in complete Freund’s adjuvant,
and the third one contained 50 μg of RBD-Fc formulated with Titermax adjuvant. One
week after the last immunization (day 20), serum samples were collected from the
three immunized mice for antibody measurement. All three antisera dose-dependently
reacted with His-tagged SARS2-RBD in ELISA, whereas the control sera from an
age-matching naïve mouse did not show significant reactivity regardless of the sera
doses used (Fig. 1A). The anti-RBD-Fc sera #1 that had the highest RBD-binding titer
(2×105) was selected for further functional analyses. The anti-RBD-Fc sera #1 could
dose-dependently inhibit the binding between recombinant ACE2-Fc fusion protein
and His-tagged SARS2-RBD in competition ELISA (Fig. 1B), indicating that the
antisera contain antibodies targeting the ACE2-binding motif within RBD. The
anti-RBD-Fc sera #1 was then assessed for its ability to neutralize SARS-CoV-2 S
protein-pseudotyped retrovirus (hereafter referred as SARS2-PV) and to neutralize
live SARS-CoV-2. As shown in Fig. 1C, the antisera dose-dependently neutralized
SARS2-PV entry with a calculated NT50 value of 10513. Moreover, addition of the
anti-RBD-Fc sera #1 prevented the development of cytopathic effect (CPE) in
SARS-CoV-2-inoculated VeroE6 cells (Supplementary Fig. 1). Results from qRT-PCR
and IFA assays showed that the anti-RBD-Fc sera #1 were highly effective,
neutralizing ＞50% infection even at the serum dilution of 1:5120 (Fig. 1D-E). Taken
together, the above results demonstrate that RBD-Fc is an immunogen capable of
efficiently inducing SARS-CoV-2-neutralizing antibodies.

RBD alone potently elicited cross-reactive, ACE2-binding blockade antibodies
towards SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV
To verify that the RBD part within the RBD-Fc fusion protein is indeed responsible
for the induction of neutralizing antibodies against SARS-CoV-2, we performed a
second mouse immunization study with recombinant SARS-CoV-2 RBD fused with a
small 6xHis tag as the vaccine antigen. A group of six BALB/c mice were immunized
by i.p. injection with 5 μg of recombinant RBD protein formulated with Alum adjuvant
at days 1, 10, and 25 (Fig. 2A). Another group of mice were injected with an irrelevant
protein (HBc) plus Alum adjuvant, serving as the control. Serum samples were
collected from individual mice at days 20 and 40, and analyzed for RBD-specific
antibody by ELISA using SARS2-RBD as the capture antigen. As shown in Fig. 2B,
neither the day-20 nor the day-40 sera in the control (HBc) group exhibited any
significant binding activity; in contrast, SARS2-RBD-binding activity was readily
detectable at day 20 in the sera from RBD-immunized mice and a significant increase
in SARS2-RBD-binding was observed for the day-40 anti-RBD sera. Equal amount of
individual antisera in the same groups were pooled for antibody titer measurement
and subsequent analyses. The day-20 and day-40 pooled anti-RBD sera
dose-dependently reacted with SARS2-RBD in ELISAs (Fig. 2C) and their binding
antibody titers were determined to be 1.6×105 and 3.2×106, respectively. The
SARS2-RBD-binding activity of the anti-RBD sera collected at day 60 (when the mice
were euthanized) was comparable to that of the day-40 anti-RBD sera (Supplemental
Fig. 2).
SARS2-RBD shares high homology with the RBD of SARS-CoV (hereafter
referred as SARS-RBD) in amino acid sequence, especially the regions outside the
receptor-binding motif. This prompted us to evaluate the cross-reactivity of our
SARS2-RBD-immunized sera towards SARS-RBD. As shown in Fig. 2D and 2E, both
individual and pooled sera from the SARS2-RBD-immunized mice showed
dose-dependent binding activity with SARS-RBD. The SARS-RBD-binding titers of
the pooled day-20 and day-40 anti-RBD sera were determined to be 4×103 and 1.6×

105, respectively.
The pooled day-40 antisera were assessed for their ability to block the interaction
between RBDs and ACE2, the entry receptor for both SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV.
Results from ACE2-binding blockade ELISA showed that the day-40 anti-RBD sera
dose-dependently inhibited hACE2-Fc binding to SARS2-RBD whereas the control
sera had no inhibitory effect on the SARS2-RBD/hACE2-Fc interaction regardless of
the sera concentration used (Fig. 2F). The anti-RBD sera also exhibited blockade
effect on the SARS-RBD/hACE2-Fc interaction, albeit with a lower efficiency (Fig.
2G).

Anti-RBD sera inhibited SARS-CoV-2 spike-mediated cell-cell fusion
The spike protein of SARS-CoV-2 has been shown to bind cell surface ACE2 and
mediate cell-cell fusion, leading to syncytia formation (Wang et al., 2020a). A cell-cell
fusion assay was developed to determine whether the anti-RBD sera could prevent
S-mediated syncytia formation. Co-culture of the 293T cells transiently expressing
S:EGFP fusion protein and the ones expressing human ACE2 protein fused with
mCherry (hACE2:mCherry) for 24 hours led to the detection of dual-fluorescent cells,
indicating the occurrence of cell-cell fusion (Supplemental Fig. 3). The cells solely
emitting green or red fluorescence and the dual-fluorescent cells were quantified by
flow cytometry. It was found that addition of the day-40 anti-RBD antisera to the
co-cultures significantly inhibited cell-cell fusion in an antisera dose-dependent
manner whereas the control sera did not exhibit significant inhibitory effect regardless
of the antisera dose used (Fig. 2H and Supplemental Fig. 4). This data indicate that
the anti-RBD sera are able to inhibit SARS2-S-mediated cell-cell fusion.

Anti-RBD sera neutralized both SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV pseudoviruses
The neutralization capacity of the mouse antisera was first evaluated using
SARS-CoV-2 S-pseudotyped retrovirus (SARS2-PV). The day-40 anti-RBD sera
potently inhibited infection of hACE2-overexpressing VeroE6 cells (VeroE6-hACE2)
with SARS2-PV and the calculated NT50 was 12764 (Fig. 3A), whereas the control

sera did not show significant inhibition even at the lowest dilution tested (1:100). The
same anti-RBD sera also inhibited infection of VeroE6-hACE2 cells with the SARS-PV
(retrovirus pseudotyped with SARS-CoV S) with NT50 being 834.8 (Fig. 3B).

Anti-RBD sera neutralized authentic SARS-CoV-2 infection
The antisera were next tested for neutralization of authentic SARS-CoV-2
infection. The anti-RBD sera were found to potently inhibite infection of VeroE6 cells
with authentic SARS2-CoV-2 based on CPE observation (Supplemental Fig. 5),
whereas the control sera did not prevent CPE development even when a sera dilution
of 1:20 (the lowest dilution tested) was used. Both qRT-PCR and IFA assays revealed
that the anti-RBD sera diluted 1:1280 nearly completely block the viral infection and
even the 1:5120 diluted anti-RBD sera could inhibit viral infection by 83% (Fig. 3C-D).
These results demonstrate that the anti-RBD sera possessed very strong
neutralization capacity against SARS-CoV-2.

Anti-RBD mouse sera did not enhance SARS-CoV-2 infection in Fc
receptor-expressing cells.
For some viruses such as dengue virus, antibodies targeting the envelope protein
may increase viral infection of FcR-expressing cells – a phenomenon called
antibody-dependent enhancement (ADE) (Huisman et al., 2009; Thomas et al., 2006).
Several FcR-bearing cell lines were used as the target cell in infection/neutralization
assays to evaluate whether our antisera could mediate ADE in vitro, including mouse
A20 cells expressing FcγRII (Antoniou and Watts, 2002), human THP-1 cells
expressing both FcγRI and FcγRII (Chan et al., 2011), and K562 cells expressing
human FcγRII (Block et al., 2010). Both THP-1 and K562 cells have been shown to
support mouse antibody-mediated enhancement of dengue virus infection in previous
studies (Block et al., 2010; Sun et al., 2017; Zhang et al., 2019). We found that
SARS2-PV entry into the three FcR-expressing cell lines was minimal (＜0.02%)
whereas the same amount of SARS2-PV yielded an infection rate of ~7% in
VeroE6-hACE2 cells. Moreover, treatment with serially diluted (ranging from 1:102 to
8

1:106) control sera or anti-RBD sera did not significantly affect SARS2-PV entry of the
three cell lines (Fig. 4A-C), indicating that the anti-RBD sera do not promote ADE of
SARS2-PV. We selected K562 cells for performing ADE assay with authentic
SARS-CoV-2 as the challenge virus. No significant increase in viral RNA level was
observed for the antisera-treated samples as compared to the control (cells only
infected with the virus) regardless of the antisera dilutions (Fig. 4D). Collectively,
these results demonstrate that, in the assay system we tested, the anti-RBD
antibodies do not promote ADE.

DISCUSSION
The present study was aimed to investigate the possibility of developing a
RBD-based subunit vaccine for SARS-CoV-2. It was found that RBD fusion proteins
with either Fc or 6 × His tag elicited high-titer neutralizing antibody responses,
indicating that RBD is the antigen component responsible for the induction of
neutralizing antibodies. In particular, the anti-RBD sera potently neutralized
SARS2-PV entry with an NT50 value of 12764 (Fig. 3A) and its neutralization
efficiency against authentic SARS-CoV-2 was ＞75% at the serum dilution of 1:5120
(Fig. 3C). According to a recent report (Gao et al., 2020), macaques immunized with a
purified inactivated SARS-CoV-2 virus vaccine candidate (which induced NT50 titers
up to 3,000 in mice) produced neutralizing serum antibody titers of around 50 to 61
and were protected from authentic SARS-CoV-2 challenge. Therefore, the seemingly
higher neutralizing antibody titers of our anti-RBD mouse antisera compared to that of
the mouse antisera against the inactivated whole-virus vaccine (although not directly
compared) strongly suggest that the RBD subunit vaccine candidate will likely be
protective as well.
The anti-RBD sera not only were able to efficiently neutralize SARS-CoV-2
infections but also could inhibit SARS2-S-mediated cell-cell fusion (Fig. 2H and
Supplementary Fig. S3 and S4), demonstrating a two-layer protective potential of the
antisera. Host receptor recognition and binding is required for coronavirus entry.
Previous work showed that, for SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, RBD binding to the

receptor triggers the spike to undergo conformational changes, allowing subsequent
protease cleavage, virus internalization and membrane fusion (Millet and Whittaker,
2018; Pallesen et al., 2017). In this study, the anti-RBD sera were found to
dose-dependently reduce the RBD binding to ACE2 in ELISAs (Fig. 1B and 2F).
These data suggest blocking the interaction between RBD/S and the host receptor
ACE2 is the main mechanism underlying the observed neutralization and cell-cell
fusion inhibition by the anti-RBD sera.
Interestingly, we found that the mouse antisera raised against SARS2-RBD
cross-reacted with SARS-RBD, inhibited SARS-RBD binding to ACE2, and
neutralized SARS-PV entry with an NT50 of 834.8. SARS2-RBD can be divided into a
core subdomain and a receptor-binding motif (RBM) which directly engages ACE2
(Lan et al., 2020; Shang et al., 2020; Yan et al., 2020). The core subdomain is highly
conserved while the RBM varies significantly (~47% homology in amino acid
sequence) between SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2. Therefore, we reason that the
observed cross binding and neutralization capacity towards SARS-CoV is contributed
by antibodies targeting the conserved core subdomain of SARS2-RBD. That is to say,
the core subdomain contains SARS-CoV-2/SARS-CoV cross-neutralization antibody
epitopes. This information will be useful for future design and development of
pan-SARS-CoV vaccines.
A major

concern in developing coronavirus vaccines is the risk of

vaccine-induced ADE (Hotez et al., 2020; Huisman et al., 2009). ADE phenomenon
has been observed for feline coronavirus (Huisman et al., 1998; Huisman et al., 2009;
Weiss and Scott, 1981) and for SARS-CoV (Bolles et al., 2011; Luo et al., 2018; Tseng
et al., 2012; Wang et al., 2016). Some cell culture studies suggested that anti-S
antibodies mediated ADE in FcR-expressing cells likely through enhancing
FcR-mediated internalization/entry of antibody-bound virions (Corapi et al., 1992;
Jaume et al., 2011; Liu et al., 2019; Olsen et al., 1992; Wan et al., 2020; Wang et al.,
2014; Yip et al., 2014). In the present study, we showed that the anti-RBD sera did not
enhance SARS2-PV entry of the three FcR-expressing cell lines (A20, THP-1, and
K562) regardless of the antisera concentration. Moreover, treatment with the
10

anti-RBD sera did not increase authentic SARS-CoV-2 infection of K562 cell, despite
the same cell line has been shown to support anti-DENV-E mouse antibody-triggered
ADE of Dengue virus (DENV) infection in previous studies (Block et al., 2010; Sun et
al., 2017; Zhang et al., 2019). These data clearly show that anti-RBD antibodies do
not promote ADE, at least not in the assay system we used. It remains to be
determined whether antibodies targeting other regions of the S protein (which
presumably will be non-neutralizing or poorly neutralizing) could mediate ADE of
SARS-CoV-2. Nonetheless, the extraordinary neutralization potency and lack of ADE
effect observed for the anti-RBD sera indicate that SARS2-RBD is an elite antigen
target for developing subunit vaccines for SARS-CoV-2.
Collectively, our results show that recombinantly expressed SARS2-RBD proteins
potently elicits cross-neutralizing antibodies against both SARS-CoV-2 and
SARS-CoV without induction of ADE antibodies, providing important information for
further development of RBD-based SARS-CoV-2 or pan-SARS-CoV subunit vaccines.

MATERIALS AND METHODS
Cells and viruses
VeroE6 cells were grown as described previously (Zhao et al., 2018). HEK 293T,
A20, THP-1, and K562 cells were purchased from the Cell Bank of Chinese Academy
of Sciences (www.cellbank.org.cn). A clinical isolate of SARS-CoV-2, nCoV-SH01
(GenBank: MT121215.1) (Rong et al., 2020), was propagated in VeroE6 cells and
viral titer was determined as plaque forming units (PFU) per milliliter (mL) by CPE
quantification. Live virus infection experiments were performed in the biosafety level-3
(BSL-3) laboratory of Fudan University.

Recombinant proteins
For mouse immunization, recombinant SARS-CoV-2 RBD fusion protein with the
Fc region of mouse IgG1 at the C-terminus (RBD-Fc) was purchased from Sino
Biological (Beijing, China), recombinant SARS-CoV-2 RBD with a C-terminal His-tag
was purchased from Kactus Biosystems (Shanghai, China), and recombinant

hepatitis B core antigen (HBc) was produced in house in E.coli as described
previously (Ye et al., 2014). For biochemical and immunological assays, several
mammalian cell-produced recombinant proteins were generated in house, including
SARS-CoV-2 RBD (amino acids 320 to 550) fused with an N-terminal Strep-tag and a
C-terminal His-tag, SARS-CoV RBD (amino acids 306-520) fused with a C-terminal
His-tag, and human ACE2 ecotodomain fused with human IgG1 Fc at the C-terminus
(hACE2-Fc).

Mouse immunization
All the animal experiments in this study were approved by the Institutional Animal
Care and Use Committee at the Institut Pasteur of Shanghai. Animals were cared for
in accordance with institutional guidelines.
In the first immunization experiment, three BALB/c mice were each injected
intraperitoneally (i.p.) with 100 μg of RBD-Fc fusion protein formulated with 500 μg of
aluminum hydroxide (Alhydrogel, Invivogen, USA) and 25 μg of CpG (Sangon, China)
at day 0. The mice were boosted subcutaneously (s.c.) at day 8 with 50 μg of RBD-Fc
plus Freund’s Adjuvant Complete (Sigma, USA) and at day 13 with 50 μg of RBD-Fc
plus Titermax adjuvant (Sigma). Blood were collected from individual mice one week
after the last immunization (day 20) and sera were stored at -80℃ until use.
In the second immunization experiment, recombinant RBD protein containing a
C-terminal 6xHis tag was formulated with the Alhydrogel adjuvant (Invivogen) and
each vaccine dose contained 5 μg of RBD and 500 μg of aluminum hydroxide; in
addition, a negative antigen control was prepared by mixing 5 μg of recombinant HBc
protein with 500 μg of aluminum hydroxide. Two groups of six BALB/c mice were
injected intraperitoneally (i.p.) with the RBD vaccine and the control antigen,
respectively, at days 0, 10, and 25. Blood samples were collected from individual mice
at days 20, 40 and 60 for antibody measurement.

For antibody measurement, wells of 96-well microtiter plates were coated with the
indicated amounts of the SARS2-RBD or SARS-RBD recombinant protein for 2 hrs at
37°C or overnight at 4°C. Then the wells were blocked with PBST containing 5%
non-fat dry milk for 1 hr at 37℃, incubated with 50μl serially diluted mouse antisera for
2 hrs at 37°C and then with 50 μl of horseradish peroxidase (HRP)-conjugated goat
anti-mouse IgG antibody for 1 hr 37°C. After color development, the absorbance at
450 nm was measured in a 96-well plate reader. For a given serum sample, its
endpoint titer was reported as the reciprocal of the highest serum dilution that had an
absorbance ≥0.1 OD unit above the blank.

ACE2 competition ELISA
Wells of 96-well microtiter plates were coated with 25 ng/well of the SARS2-RBD
or SARS-RBD recombinant protein overnight at 4°C, followed by blocking with PBST
containing 5% non-fat dry milk for 1 hr at 37℃. Serially diluted mouse antisera were
mixed with 20 ng of biotinylated hACE2-Fc in a final volume of 50μl and the mixtures
were added to the wells, followed by incubation for 2 hrs at 37°C. Then, 50 μl of
horseradish peroxidase (HRP)-conjugated streptavidin (Life Technologies, USA) was
added to wells, followed by incubation for 1 hr at 37°C. After washing, TMB substrate
(Life Technologies) was added into wells for color development. The plates were read
for absorbance at 450 nm in a 96-well plate reader.

Cell-cell fusion inhibition assay
HEK 293T cells were separately transfected with a plasmid encoding the
SARS-CoV-2 S:EGFP fusion protein (pcDNA-S:EGFP) or with a plasmid encoding the
hACE2:mCherry fusion protein (pcDNA-hACE2:mCherry). One day later, equal
amount of the pcDNA-S:EGFP-transfected and pcDNA-hACE2:mCherry-transfected
cells were mixed and then cultured for 24 hrs. Unmixed cells were set aside as
controls. To determine the antisera’s blockade effects, pcDNA-S:EGFP-transfected
cells were treated with serially diluted antisera for 1 hr at 37℃ before mixing with
pcDNA-hACE2:mCherry-transfected cells. After co-culture for 24 hrs, the cells were

subjected to fluorescence microscopy or flow cytometry. The cells emitting green or
red fluorescence only or both were quantified by flow cytometry. For a given sample,
its cell-cell fusion efficiency was calculated and normalized against that of the sample
without antisera treatment as follows: relative cell-cell fusion efficiency (%)

= (the

ratio of the dual-fluorescence cells to the EGFP-only cells of the given sample) / (the
ratio of the dual-fluorescence cells to the EGFP-only cells of the sample without
antisera treatment)×100.

Pseudovirus neutralization assay
To produce pseudoviruses, HEK293T cells were transfected using PEI with a
plasmid encoding murine leukemia virus (MLV) gag/pol, a retroviral vector encoding
EGFP, and an envelope plasmid expressing full-length S protein of SARS-CoV-2 or
SARS-CoV (AY569693). Six hours later, the cells were washed and incubated in fresh
medium. At 48 hours post-transfection, pseudovirus-containing culture supernatants
were harvested. For neutralization assay, 100 μl of the pseudovirus was pre-mixed
with 50 μl of serum samples diluted in DMEM and incubated at 37℃ for 1 hr. The
mixture was then onto VeroE6 cells overexpressing hACE2 (denoted as
VeroE6-hACE2)

preseeded

in

48-well

plates.

Eight

hours

later,

the

virus/sera-containing media were removed and exchanged with fresh media
containing 10% FBS. At 72 hours post-infection, the cells were analyzed by flow
cytometry. The infectivity of pseudotyped particles incubated with antibodies was
compared with the infectivity observed using pseudotyped particles incubated with
DMEM medium containing 2% fetal calf serum (FBS) and standardized to 100%.

Live virus neutralization assay
All serum samples were heat-inactivated at 56°C for 30 minutes prior to live virus
neutralization assay. SARS-CoV-2 virus (200 PFU in a volume of 50μl) was
pre-incubated with the diluted serum sample for 1 hour at 37°C. The virus-serum
mixture was then added onto VeroE6 cells (4×104/well) in 96-well plate and cultured
for 48 hours. At the end of the incubation, culture supernatants were collected for viral

RNA analysis and cells were fixed for immunofluorescence analysis.
Viral RNA in culture supernatant was extracted using TRIzol reagent (Invitrogen,
USA) following the manufacturer’s instructions. Quantitative real-time PCR (qRT-PCR)
was performed in a 20-μL reaction containing SYBR Green (Tiangen, China) on an
MXP3000 cycler (Stratagene, La Jolla, USA). PCR primers (Genewiz, Suzhou, China)
targeting SARS-CoV-2 N gene (nt 608-706) were as the following: forward primer,
5’-GGGGAACTTCTCCTGCTAGAAT-3’;

and

reverse

primer,

5’-CAGACATTTTGCTCTCAAGCTG-3’.
For immunofluorescence analysis, cells were fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde,
permeabilized by 0.2% Triton X-100 (Thermo Fisher Scientific, USA), and stained
overnight at 4°C with an anti-N mouse polyclonal antibody generated in house. The
samples were finally incubated with Alexa Fluor 488-labeled donkey anti-mouse IgG
secondary antibody (1:1000, Thermo Fisher Scientific) at 37°C for 1 hour. The nuclei
were stained with DAPI (Thermo Fisher Scientific). Images were captured under a
fluorescence microscope (Thermo Fisher Scientific).

ADE assay
FcR-expressing cell lines, including A20, THP-1, and K562, were used to perform
ADE assays. Briefly, the antisera were serially diluted, mixed with either SARS2-PV or
authentic SARS-CoV-2 (6,000 PFU), and incubated at 37℃ for 1 hr. Then, the
mixtures were added to the target cells. The following infection and culturing steps
were carried out as described above in the pseudovirus neutralization and live virus
neutralization assays. Mock-infected cells and cells only infected with SARS2-PV or
authentic SARS-CoV-2 were set as the negative and positive controls, respectively.
Infection rates of the samples were determined as described above.

Statistics analysis
All statistical analyses were performed using GraphPad Prism software v5.0.
Kaplan–Meier survival curves were compared using log-rank test. Statistical
significance between treatments was analyzed using Student's 2-tailed t-test and

Figure 4. Assessment of the anti-RBD sera for potential ADE. (A-C) ADE assays
with SARS2-PV as the inoculum. Serial dilutions of the anti-RBD or the control sera
were incubated with SARS2-S pseudotyped retrovirus for 1 hour at 37 °C. The
mixtures were added to (A) A20, (B) THP-1, or (C) K562 cell suspensions, followed by
incubation at 37°C for three days. Infected cells were subjected to flow cytometry
analysis. Data are expressed as percentage of the GFP-expressing cells in relation to
the total cells counted. Means ± SD of triplicate wells are shown. (D) ADE assay
with live SARS-CoV-2 virus as the inoculum. Serial dilutions of the anti-RBD or the

37 °C for three days. Infected cell cultures were subjected to RNA extraction and
qPCR analysis. Data are expressed as percentage of the viral RNA copy number of
the treatment groups in relation to that of the virus-only control. Means ± SD of
triplicate wells are shown. Significant differences between the virus only (without
antisera treatment) group and each of the antisera treatment groups were indicated:
n.s., P﹥0.05.

Supplemental Figure 1. Treatment with the anti-RBD-Fc sera #1 inhibited
SARS-CoV-2 infection-triggered CPE. VeroE6 cells were inoculated with mixtures
of authentic SARS-CoV-2 and serially diluted anti-RBD-Fc sera #1. The cells were
checked daily for CPE. Data presented are images taken at 48 hours post-infection.
The test concentrations of the anti-RBD-Fc sera #1 are indicated.

Supplemental Figure 2. Comparison of binding activities of the day-40 and
day-60 anti-RBD sera pools. The indicated antisera were serially diluted and
analyzed by ELISA with (A) SARS2-RBD or (B) SARS-RBD proteins as the coating
antigen. Data shown are mean OD450nm values and SD of triplicate wells.

of

the

pcDNA-S:EGFP-transfected and pcDNA-hACE2:mCherry-transfected cells were
mixed and then cultured for 24 hrs. Unmixed cells were set aside as controls. To
determine the antisera’s blockade effects, pcDNA-S:EGFP-transfected cells were
treated with serially diluted antisera for 1 hr at 37 ℃

before mixing with

pcDNA-hACE2:mCherry-transfected cells. After co-culture for 24 hrs, the cells were
fixed, stained with DAPI and examined under a fluorescent microscope.

Supplemental Figure 4. Inhibition of SARS2-S-mediated cell-cell fusion by
anti-RBD sera. HEK 293T cells transiently expressing SARS2-S:EGFP fusion protein
were incubated with the indicated dilutions of antisera for 1 hr at 37°C and then mixed
with HEK 293T cells transiently expressing hACE2:mCherry, followed by co-culture for
24 hours. Cells without antisera treatment were set as the control. The cell samples
were analyzed by flow cytometry. Representative flow cytometry graphs are shown.
For a given sample, its cell-cell fusion efficiency was determined as the ratio of the
dual-fluorescence cells to the EGFP-only cells
