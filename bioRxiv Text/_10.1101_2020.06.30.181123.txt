Abstract
The SARS-CoV-2 identified as coronavirus species associated with severe acute respiratory
syndrome. At the time of writing, the genetic diversity of Moroccan strains of SARS-CoV-2 is
poorly documented. The present study aims to analyze and identify the genetic variants of fortyeight Moroccan strains of SARS-CoV-2 collected from mid-March to the end of May and the
prediction of their possible sources. Our results revealed 108 mutations in Moroccan SARS-CoV-2,
50% were non-synonymous were present in seven genes (S, M, N, E, ORF1ab, ORF3a, and ORF8)
with variable frequencies. Remarkably, eight non-synonymous mutations were predicted to have a
deleterious effect for (ORF1ab, ORF3a , and the N protein. The analysis of the haplotype network
of Moroccan strains suggests different sources of SARS-CoV-2 infection in Morocco. Likewise, the
phylogenetic analysis revealed that these Moroccan strains were closely related to those belonging
to the five continents, indicating no specific strain dominating in Morocco. These findings have the
potential to lead to new comprehensive investigations combining genomic data, epidemiological
information, and clinical characteristics of SARS-CoV-2 patients in Morocco and could indicate
that the developed vaccines are likely to be effective against Moroccan strains.

Introduction
The novel coronavirus 2019, also known as severe acute respiratory syndrome Coronavirus 2
(SARS-CoV-2) (1), is the causative agent of coronavirus disease-2019 (COVID-19), a new type of
pneumonia that has caused an epidemic in Wuhan, China, in late December 2020. The virus's fast
transmission worldwide and a large number of confirmed cases made the World Health
Organization (WHO) declare COVID-19 as a global pandemic on March 11, 2020 (2). As of
October 11, 2020, the virus has spread to 235 different countries, infected more than 37 million
people, and caused more than one million deaths (https://covid19.who.int/). It should be noted that
mortality from SARS-CoV-2 differs considerably by geographic region. In Morocco, the first case
of COVID-19 was identified on March 02. Since then, the number of infections and the number of
deaths has been increasing continuously; by October 11, 2020, the Moroccan ministry of Health
announced 149,841 confirmed cases, including 2,572 deaths.
SARS-CoV-2 is a positive-sense single-stranded RNA virus, encoding four structural proteins
(spike (S), envelope (E), membrane (M) and nucleocapsid (N), 16 non-structural proteins (nsp1 to
nsp16), and five accessory proteins (ORF3a, ORF6, ORF7a, ORF7b, and ORF8) (3, 4). Among
these, two genes are considered to be the most important targets for candidate vaccines: the S
protein, which is responsible for the binding to host cells membrane receptors (ACE2) via its
receptor-binding domain (RBD), and the RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp, also called
nsp12) which is a key part of the virus replication/transcription machinery (5-7).
It is known that the mutation rate of the RNA virus contributes to viral adaptation, creating a
balance between the integrity of genetic information and the variability of the genome, thus
allowing viruses to evade the host’s immune system and develop drug resistance (8, 9). Indeed,
recent studies have reported specific genotypes at particular geographic locations and that the
evolution of SARS-CoV-2 over time shows a mechanism of co-accumulation of mutations that
could potentially affect the spread and the severity of this virus (OYW).
At the time of writing, genetic variants, their impact, and distribution along the viral genome of
Moroccan strains are poorly documented. Few studies investigating the genetic characteristics have
been done so far. The analysis of 20 Moroccan SARS-CoV-2 genomes suggested that the epidemic
spread in Morocco did not show a predominant SARSCoV-2 route and took origin from multiple
and unrelated sources (8). In this study, we investigated the level of diversity of 48 strains of
SARS-CoV-2 that were collected in Morocco between mid-March and the end of May 2020,
including nine new strains. The potential source of these strains was also predicted by comparison
to other genomes from six continents.

Materials and Methods
Data collection and Genomes sequencing
Thirty-nine Moroccan genomes were collected from the GISAID database (http://gisaid.org) (10).
Also, nine genomes were sequenced in-house recently to build a dataset counting 48 Moroccan
genomes.
The nine genomes' sequencing was achieved by the routine workflow on the MinION Mk1B
Nanopore platform using the R9.4.1 flowcell. The viral RNA was extracted from nine clinical
samples, and the cDNA was synthesized using a kit (Roche) with random hexamers. Genome
enrichment was done by Q5 Hot Start High-Fidelity DNA Polymerase (NEB), following the
manufacturer's specifications, using a set of primers designed by the ARTIC network
(https://artic.network/ncov-2019) that target overlapping regions of the SARS-CoV-2 genome. The
PCR products were purified by adding an equal volume of AMPure XP beads (Beckman Coulter).
The sequencing was performed according to the eight-hour routine workflow, and amplicons were
repaired with NEBNext FFPE Repair Mix (NEB), followed by the DNA ends preparation using
NEBNext End repair/ dA-tailing Module (NEB) before adding native barcodes and sequencing
adapters supplied in the EXP-NBD104/114 kit (Nanopore) to the DNA ends. After priming the flow
cell, 60 ng DNA per sample was pooled with a final volume of 65 uL. Following the ligation
sequencing kit (SQK-LSK109) protocol, the sequencing was performed using the MinION Mk1B
device.
The assembly
The gupplyplex and minion scripts of the ARTIC Network bioinformatics protocol
(https://artic.network/ncov-2019/ncov2019-bioinformatics-sop.html)

were

used

for

reads

Preprocessing and Consensus Building for nanopore sequencing. Gupplyplex (default parameters)
was used for quality control and filtering of reads (--min-length 400 --max-length 700) followed by
MinION pipeline (default parameters) to perform the sequences mapping, primers trimming,
variations calling, and consensus assembly building.
Variant calling analysis
A set of 39 SARS-CoV-2 genomes were downloaded from the GISAID database
(http://www.gisaid.org/) and added to the nine newly sequenced genomes (10)(Table 1).
The reads generated by MinION Nanopore-Oxford of the nine isolates were mapped to the
reference sequence genome Wuhan-Hu-1/2019 using BWA-MEM v0.7.17-r1188 (11) with default
parameters, while the data downloaded from the GISAID database were mapped using Minimap
v2.12-r847 (12)

The BAM files were sorted using SAMtools (13)and were subsequently used to call the genetic
variants in variant call format (VCF) by BCFtools (13). The final call set of the 48 genomes was
annotated, and their impact was predicted using SnpEff v 4.3t (14). First, the SnpEff databases were
built locally using annotations of the reference genome NC_045512.2 obtained in the GFF format
from the NCBI database. Then, the SnpEff database was used to annotate SNPs and with putative
functional

effects

according

to

the

categories

defined

in

the

SnpEff

manual

(http://snpeff.sourceforge.net/SnpEff_manual.html) . The variants were also evaluated for
functional consequences using the SIFT algorithm (34). The SIFT prediction is given as a Tolerance
Index score ranging from 0.0 to 1.0, which is the normalized probability that the amino acid change
is tolerated. SIFT scores less than or equal to 0.05 are predicted by the algorithm to be intolerant or
deleterious amino acid substitutions, while scores greater than 0.05 are considered tolerant.
Phylogenetic and haplotype network analysis
In order to determine the source(s) of strains circulating in morocco, we performed a multiple
sequence alignment using Muscle v 3.8 (15) for the 48 Moroccan strains with 225 genomes of
SARS-CoV-2 from Africa, Asia, Europe, North, South America, and Oceania (Supplementary
Material ;Table S2). Maximum-likelihood trees were inferred with IQ-TREE v1.5.5 under the
GTR model (16). Generated trees were visualized using FigTree 1.4.3 To generate haplotypes for
the 48 Moroccan genomes, we aligned the viruses' complete genomes using Muscle v 3.8 (15).
The generated (.fasta) file was converted to a (.meg) file using a home-made script. Using the
dnasp5 tool (17), we generated the file (.rdf), compatible with the NETWORK Package, which
allowed the network's tracing linking the 48 genomes' haplotypes, using the MJ (Median Joining).
In order to estimate genealogical relationships of haplotype groups, the phylogenetic networks
were inferred by PopART package v1.7.2 (18)using the TCS method and MSN, respectively.

Results
Genetic diversity of Moroccan strains of SARS-CoV-2
To identify and study the genetic variants of the SARS-COV-2 genomes from Morocco, 48
genomes were collected from mid-March to the end of May; including nine strains sequenced in the
present study (Supplementary Material , Table S1). 94.9% to 99.93% of the reads produced for
the nine genomes were correctly mapped to the Wuhan-Hu-1/2019 reference sequence. Analysis of
genetic variants revealed a total of 108 variant sites in the 48 genomes analyzed (Figure 1);
including 54 (50%) non-synonymous, 42 (38.89%) synonymous, and 3 frame-shifts (2.78%). The
remaining (8.33%) were distributed along the intergenic regions.

in 48 Moroccan genomes. Colored circles represent gene distribution across the genomes.
Lollipop stick represents individual mutation. Colored circles represent the type of mutation
and the blue box represents the number of genomes harboring the mutations.
Interestingly, 36.11% of the total mutations were shared between at least two genomes, while the
rest were singleton mutations (unique to one genome). Mutational distribution along the viral
genome revealed seven affected genes (ORF1ab, S, N, M, E, ORF8, and ORF3a) with varying
mutational frequencies. Among the non-synonymous mutations, 28 were located in the ORF1ab
gene and were present in eight non-structural proteins; 9 mutations in the nsp12-RNA-dependent
RNA polymerase (RdRp) (C4588F, S4611L, C4772F, T5020I, A5039S, V5104L, T5220I,
R5314M, and T5448I), eight mutations in the nsp3-Multi-domain (D1036E, L1249H, S1520F,
F202526 P21V47, V204710, V2047, and T2648I), three mutations in nsp5-main proteinase
(V3388I, N3405S, V3420L), three mutations in nsp14-Exonuclease (P6000S, T6249P, M6345V), 2
in nsp15-one (EndoRNAse) (K6486R and R6648G), 1 in nsp2 (T265I), one in nsp10-CysHis
(R4387S), and 1 in nsp16 Methyltransferase (T7083I) (Table S2). We systematically performed the
analysis predicting the deleterious effect of missense mutations in two genomes or more. Functional
evaluation based on the SIFT (Sorting Intolerant From Tolerant) algorithm broke the tolerance
index score of 15 missense mutations (found in two genomes or more), revealing its deleterious
effect (Table 1).

Haplotype network analysis
To estimate the number of introductions of the SARS-CoV-2 virus in Morocco, an analysis of the
haplotype network was carried out using the 48 strains. Our results showed that these strains were
grouped into five distinct clades, harboring 28 haplotypes from which three were dominant (Figure
2).

Figure 2: Haplotype network using genome-wide single-nucleotide variations (HN-GSNVs) of
SARS-CoV-2 isolates from Morocco.
Current samples have shown three major haplotypes harboring the majority of strains, H2 (11
strains), H4 (5 strains), H5 (4 strains), followed by H17, H21, and H1, indicating the predominance
of H2 among Moroccan strains.
In Figure 3, the haplotypes are distributed in potential haplotype groups. Specifically, 43, 16, 47,
and 88 haplotypes may be sub-haplotypes of primary ancestral haplotypes H1, H89, H25, and H59.
Three of the 194 haplotypes that were found in Moroccan isolates were Moroccan-specific. The
majority of Moroccan sequences were associated with haplotype group H25.

Figure 3:

Haplotype network using genome-wide single-nucleotide variations (HN-

GSNVs) of SARS-CoV-2 isolates in the world. Whole-genome sequences of SARS-CoV-2
isolates from 48 Moroccan patients were compared with 279 GISAID-available SARS-CoV-2
genomes from different parts of the world by median-joining SNV network analysis. Colors
represent the sequence origin’s while the black strikes represent the number of mutations.
The haplotype groups' distribution patterns differed in various geographic regions, with a few
countries/territory specific. The 25 haplotypes harbored mainly strains from Asia, North American,
and Africa, respectively, and are considered the ancestral strains. The number of haplotypes

and Europe and give birth to five haplotypes from North America and Morocco. Lastly, group 4,
which contains mostly strains from Asia, harbored fewer strains from Morocco.
Phylogenetic analysis of Moroccan SARS-CoV-2 genomes with genomes belonging to six
geographic areas
The phylogenetic analysis was carried out using 272 genomes from different countries belonging to
the six continents (Supplementary Material ; Table S3) to study the possible origin of SARSCoV-2 strains circulating in Morocco. According to the GISAID nomenclature (Figure 3), our
results revealed seven main clades: the "L" clade mainly contained genomes from Asia, while the
other clades contained genomes belonging to different geographical areas.

We observed that all Moroccan SARS-CoV-2 strains belonged to three close clades "G, GH, and
GR," harboring all the D614G mutation. These clades are also subdivided into several subclades.
The G clade housed about half of the Moroccan strains and is mainly closely related to European
origin strains, except three strains (Morocco / S6S, Morocco / ref1, Morocco / HMMV4) are closer
to strains from Kenya and the USA. Meanwhile, among the Moroccan strains of the GH clade, five
(Maroc / RMPS-01, Maroc / RMPS-14, Maroc / RMPS-04, Maroc / RMPS-10, Maroc / RMPS-13,
Maroc / 6901) grouped close to the strains of Tunisia; In contrast, the other Moroccan strains of this
same clade appear to share close sequence similarity with strains from different geographic areas,
including Asia (Israel, Taiwan, Saudi Arabia), North America (USA), Europe (France, England),
and South America (Colombia). On the other hand, the GR clade contained four Moroccan strains
(Maroc / 6906, Maroc / 6899, Maroc / 6904, Maroc / 6900, Maroc / 6887) grouped with strains
from the Gambia, Senegal (West Africa), and Bangladesh (Asia). Moreover, nine strains were
grouped with European strains, mainly from Russia, the Czech Republic, Spain, and Cyprus.
Overall, Moroccan strains were closely related to those from different continents, indicating
different infection sources.
Discussion
The monitoring of genetic variants plays a significant role in orienting the therapeutic approach for
the development of candidate vaccines to limit the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic (19), as there is
currently no proven effective treatment for SARS-CoV-2.
To date, the genetic diversity of strains of SARS-CoV-2 from Morocco is poorly documented. In
this study, we performed a detailed analysis of genetic variants of forty-eight Moroccan strains,
including nine newly sequenced, to provide new information on genetic diversity and transmission
of SARS-CoV-2 in Morocco.
Genetic diversity could potentially increase the physical shape of the viral population and make it
difficult to fight, or the opposite, make the virus weaker, which could be translated with a loss of its
virulence and a decrease in the number of critical cases (20). Compared to the Wuhan-Hu-1/2019
reference sequence, Moroccan strains harbored 4 to 15 genetic variants per strain, of which 1 to 11
involve a change of amino acids. These results are consistent with the mutation rate previously
reported in SASR-CoV-2 from different geographic areas (21-24) , reporting a low frequency of
recurrent mutations in thousands of SARS-CoV-2 genomes(21) . In total, 108 variant sites have
been identified, of which only 36% are present in two or more genomes. This result correlates with
previous studies that SARS-CoV-2 evolved and diversified mainly by a random genetic drift, which
plays a dominant role in propagating single mutations (25-27) .

The mutations were distributed along the virus genome. The ORF1ab polyprotein region, known to
be express 16 non-structural proteins (nsp1-nsp16), had several mutations that could affect their
activity (3). Three non-synonymous deleterious mutations were found in the RdRp region (also
called nsp12), a key part of the replication/transcription machinery, and which is proposed as a
potential therapeutic target to inhibit viral infection (28, 29). Likewise, a deleterious mutation has
been predicted in the NSP3 protein, In addition, two deleterious mutations have been observed in
ORF3a, an accessory protein that makes it possible to regulate the interferon signaling pathway and
the production of cytokines (30), and the structural N protein that plays a crucial function in the
virus genome by regulating RNA transcription and modulating biological processes in infected
cells.
RNA viruses acquire mutations readily, most of which are deleterious, and viruses carrying such
mutations are eliminated. If a mutation reaches a high frequency, the mutation is expected to
provide a selective advantage to the virus, usually manifested by a higher transmission efficiency.
Three of these deleterious mutations (T5020I-nsp3, G204R-N, Q57H-ORF3a) have been previously
reported (N-P) as hotspot mutations a large population belonging to different geographical areas.
Five non-synonymous mutations were common within at least two genomes, among them, D614G
(in S protein) and Q57H (in OR3a). The D614G mutation is proximal to the S1 cleavage domain of
advanced glycoprotein (31) and was of great interest due to their predominance in the six continents
(32, 33). Alouane et al. (21) showed that this mutation appeared for the first time on January 24,
2020, in the Asian region (China); after a week, it was also observed in Europe (Germany). The
Q57H mutation was taken away end of February in Africa (Senegal), Europe (France and Belgium),
and North America (the USA and Canada). Likewise, our previous study (21) showed that D614G
had no impact on the two-dimensional and three-dimensional advanced glycoprotein structures.
Furthermore, four of these five mutations (D614G, Q57H, T265I, and T5020I) have been
considered hotspot mutations in a large population (21, 22). With this in mind, we believe that this
will not present a serious issue for vaccine development and that a universal candidate vaccine for
all circulating strains of SARS-CoV-2 may be possible.
It should be noted that our predicted deleterious variants in protein structure lack experimental
validation. Further exploration would be needed to confirm their potential effects further.
Our results of the haplotype network of Moroccan strains revealed five diverse clades with 28
haplotypes, indicating different infection sources. Besides the haplotype network, the phylogenetic
analysis using a set of 273 strains representing the six continents revealed seven main clades. The
most important clade contained approximately three-quarters of all the strains. All SARS-CoV-2
strains from North Africa harboring the D614G mutation belonged to this clade, except for three
Tunisian strains. Interestingly, the Moroccan and Tunisian strains were closely related to those from

Asia, Europe, South, and North America, which could indicate different sources of SARS-CoV-2
infection in these two countries.
Conclusion:
The results of this study provide valuable information on the diversity and impact of genetic
variants of Moroccan strains of SARS-CoV-2 and their possible origins. This discovery could
contribute to further in-depth investigations combining genomic data and clinical epidemiology of
SARS-CoV -2 patients in Morocco, and

suggest that, to date, the limited diversity seen in

Moroccan SARS-CoV-2 should not preclude a single vaccine from providing global protection.
