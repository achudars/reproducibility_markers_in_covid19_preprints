Abstract
As the COVID-19 pandemic continues to fold out, the morbidity and mortality are increasing
daily. Effective treatment for SARS-CoV-2 is urgently needed. We recently discovered four
SARS-CoV-2 main protease (Mpro) inhibitors including boceprevir, calpain inhibitors II and XII
and GC-376 with potent antiviral activity against infectious SARS-CoV-2 in cell culture. Despite
the weaker enzymatic inhibition of calpain inhibitors II and XII against Mpro compared to GC376, calpain inhibitors II and XII had more potent cellular antiviral activity. This observation
promoted us to hypothesize that the cellular antiviral activity of calpain inhibitors II and XII
might also involve the inhibition of cathepsin L in addition to Mpro. To test this hypothesis, we
tested calpain inhibitors II and XII in the SARS-CoV-2 pseudovirus neutralization assay in Vero
E6 cells and found that both compounds significantly decreased pseudoviral particle entry into
cells, indicating their role in inhibiting cathepsin L. The involvement of cathepsin L was further
confirmed in the drug time-of-addition experiment. In addition, we found that these four
compounds not only inhibit SARS-CoV-2, but also SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV, as well as human
coronaviruses (CoVs) 229E, OC43, and NL63. The mechanism of action is through targeting the
viral Mpro, which was supported by the thermal shift binding assay and enzymatic FRET assay.
We further showed that these four compounds have additive antiviral effect when combined with
remdesivir. Altogether, these results suggest that boceprevir, calpain inhibitors II and XII, and
GC-376 are not only promising antiviral drug candidates against existing human coronaviruses,
but also might work against future emerging CoVs.

Coronaviruses (CoVs) are enveloped positive-stranded RNA virus which infect humans and
multiple species of animals, causing a variety of highly prevalent and severe diseases.1, 2 In the
last two decades, three highly pathogenic and lethal human coronaviruses have emerged: severe
acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV), the virus that caused the outbreak of
severe acute respiratory syndrome in human in Southern China in 2002 and killed 774 people
among 8,098 infected worldwide;3 MERS-CoV, which causes severe respiratory disease
outbreak in Middle East in 2012, led to 791 deaths among 2,229 infected;4 the SARS-CoV-2, a
novel coronavirus emerged in China in December 2019, quickly spread worldwide and became a
global pandemic.5 As of October 28th 2020, there are more than 44 million confirmed cases and

(https://coronavirus.jhu.edu/map.html). In addition, human coronavirus (HCoV) strains 229E
(HCoV-229E), NL63 (HCoV-NL63), OC43 (HCoV-OC43), and HKU1 (HCoV-HKU1) cause a
significant portion of annual upper and lower respiratory tract infections in humans, including
common colds, bronchiolitis, and pneumonia.6-8 There are currently no antivirals or vaccines for
either the highly pathogenic SARS-CoV-2, SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV or the human CoVs. The
current COVID-19 pandemic is a timely reminder of the urgent need for therapeutics against
coronavirus infection. As future coronavirus outbreak cannot be excluded, it is desired to
develop broad-spectrum antivirals that are not only active against existing CoVs, but also future
emerging CoVs.
Coronavirus genome ranges from 26 to 32 kb, of which the 3′-terminal region, proximately
one-third of the genome, encodes a number of structural proteins (spike protein, envelope
protein, membrane protein, and nucleocapsid protein), while the 5′-terminal region,
approximately two-thirds of the genome, encodes for the non-structural proteins (3-

chymotrypsin-like protease (3CL or main protease), papain-like protease, helicase, RNAdependent RNA polymerase, exoribonuclease and endoribonuclease, methyl transferase), and
accessary proteins.9 Among the viral proteins under investigation as antiviral drug targets, the
main protease (Mpro) appears to be a high-profile drug target for development of broad-spectrum
antivirals for the following reasons: 1) The Mpro plays an essential role in coronavirus replication
by cleaving the viral polyproteins at more than 11 sites;10 2) The Mpros have relatively high
sequence similarity within each CoV group;11 3) The Mpro has an unique substrate preference for
glutamine at the P1 site (Leu-Gln↓(Ser,Ala,Gly)), a feature that is absent in closely related host
proteases,12 suggesting it is feasible to design Mpro inhibitors with a high selectivity; (4) The
structures of Mpros from multiple members of CoV family have been solved,13-16 paving the way
for rational drug design.
We recently discovered four SARS-CoV-2 Mpro inhibitors including boceprevir, calpain
inhibitors II and XII, and GC-376 (Figure 1).17 They had single-digit micromolar to
submicromolar IC50 values in the enzymatic assay, and inhibited SARS-CoV-2 viral replication
in cell culture with EC50 values in the single-digit micromolar to submicromolar range.17 The cocrystal structures of GC-376, calpain inhibitors II and XII in complex with SARS-CoV-2 Mpro
have been solved, providing a molecular explanation for the tight binding of these compounds
towards Mpro.17,

18

Interestingly, despite the weaker enzymatic inhibition potency of calpain

inhibitors II and XII against Mpro (IC50 = 0.97 µM and 0.45 µM, respectively) compared with
GC-376 (IC50 = 0.03 µM), calpain inhibitors II and XII had more potent cellular antiviral activity
(EC50 = 2.07 µM and 0.49 µM, respectively) than GC-376 (EC50 = 3.37 µM). We also found
calpain inhibitors II and XII inhibit human cathepsin L in the in vitro enzymatic assay,18 and
cathepsin L has been shown to play an essential role in SARS-CoV-2 cell entry by activating the

viral spike protein in the late endosome or lysosome.19, 20 These observations led us to speculate
that the potent cellular antiviral activity of calpain inhibitors II and XII might be a result of
inhibiting both viral Mpro and host cathepsin L. To test the hypothesis that the cellular antiviral
activity of calpain inhibitors II and XII involves the inhibition of cathepsin L, we performed
SARS-CoV-2 pseudovirus neutralization assay and the drug time-of-addition assay using HCoVOC43 virus. Results from both assays indeed support the contribution of inhibition of cathepsin
L to the cellular antiviral activity of calpain inhibitors II and XII.

Figure 1. Chemical structures of SARS-CoV-2 Mpro inhibitors boceprevir, calpain inhibitors II
and XII and GC-376.

To evaluate the broad-spectrum antiviral activity of boceprevir, calpain inhibitors II and XII,
and GC-376, we tested them against two other highly pathogenic coronaviruses the SARS-CoV
and MERS-CoV, as well as three human coronaviruses HCoV-OC43, HCoV-NL63, and HCoV229E. The mechanism of action was studied by the thermal shift binding assay and FRET-based
enzymatic assay. The combination therapy potential of these four compounds with remdesivir
was also quantified by the drug combination index method. Altogether, our work demonstrated
that boceprevir, calpain inhibitors II and XII, and GC-376 are promising drug candidates for the
design and development of broad-spectrum antivirals against current and future emerging CoVs.

RESULTS AND DISCUSSION
Calpain inhibitors II and XII, but not GC-376 or boceprevir, blocked the entry of SARSCoV-2 pseudoviral particles
Pseudovirus neutralization assay is an established model to study the mechanism of viral cell
entry and has been widely used to assess the antiviral activity of viral entry/fusion inhibitors.21, 22
Calpain inhibitors II and XII are potent inhibitors of human cathepsin L, with KI and IC50 values
in the nanomolar range.18, 23 Cathepsin L plays an important role in SARS-CoV-2 viral entry by
cleaving the viral spike S protein in the endosome or lysosome.19,

20

We hypothesized that

cellular antiviral mechanism of calpain inhibitors II and XII might involve inhibition of
cathepsin L besides Mpro. To test this hypothesis, we first amplified SARS-CoV-2 pseudoviral
particles in ACE2-expressing HEK293T cells (ACE2/293T) as previously described.21 We then
performed pseudovirus entry assay in Vero E6 cells, which have been shown to have minimal
levels of TMPRSS2 expression, therefore SARS-CoV-2 cell entry is mainly mediated through
endocytosis, which relies on cathepsin L for viral spike protein activation.19 E-64d, a known
cathepsin L inhibitor, was included as a positive control and it was found to inhibit SARS-CoV-2
pseudovirus entry with an IC50 value of 0.91 ± 0.10 µM (Figure 2A). Both calpain inhibitors II
and XII also showed inhibitory activity against SARS-CoV-2 pseudovirus entry into Vero E6
cells with IC50 values of 9.26 ± 1.35 and 5.28 ± 0.74 µM, respectively (Figures 2B and 2C).
However, neither GC-376 nor boceprevir had significant effect on SARS-CoV-2 pseudovirus
entry at up to 100 µM concentration (Figures 2D and 2E). Altogether, it can be concluded that
the cellular antiviral activity of calpain inhibitors II and XII involves the inhibition of cathepsin
L, while GC-376 and boceprevir had no effect on cathepsin L-mediated viral entry.

Drug time-of-addition experiment showed that calpain inhibitor XII inhibited HCoV-OC43
replication at both the early and intermediate stages of viral replication
Mpro mediates the cleavage of viral polyproteins pp1a and pp1ab during the viral replication
process, therefore Mpro inhibitors such as GC-376 are expected to inhibit viral replication in the
intermediate stage of viral replication in the drug time-of-addition experiment. In contrast,
cathepsin L plays a role in the early stage of viral fusion by cleaving the viral spike protein. As

such, cathepsin L inhibitor should inhibit the early stage of viral replication. Dual inhibitors such
as calpain inhibitors II and XII are expected to inhibit viral replication at both the early and the
intermediate stages. To test this hypothesis, we chose calpain inhibitor XII as a representative
example and performed the drug time-of-addition experiment by adding inhibitor at different
time points either before, during, or after HCoV-OC43 viral replication (Figure 3). GC-376 was
included as a control of monospecific Mpro inhibitor. Viruses in the supernatant were harvested
16 hpi and the viral titers were quantified by plaque reduction assay. HCoV-OC43 was used for
this experiment as it enters cells via endocytosis and relies on cathepsin L in late endosome for
viral spike protein cleavage and activation,24 similar to SARS-CoV-2. HCoV-OC43 is a BSL-2
pathogen and is frequently used as surrogate virus of SARS-CoV-2 for mechanistic studies. Both
viruses belong to the β-coronavirus lineage and share many similarities. When applied during
viral infection and removed through washing afterward, GC-376 showed no antiviral activity
(Figure 3), suggesting that GC-376 had no effect on virus entry. The antiviral potency of GC-376
gradually decreased when it was added at later stages of viral replication (6 and 9 hpi) (Figure 3),
indicating that GC-376 inhibited viral replication at an intermediate stage, which is in line with
its mechanism of action by targeting Mpro. In contrast, calpain inhibitor XII inhibited both the
early and intermediate stages of viral replication. Specifically, compared to DMSO control, ~ 1
log10 decrease in the viral tier was observed when it was added during virus infection, suggesting
it inhibited the early stage of viral entry (Figure 3). In addition, the antiviral potency of calpain
inhibitor XII gradually decreased when added at later stages of viral replication (6 and 9 hpi)
(Figure 3). Taken together, the drug time-of-addition experiment further confirmed the dual
cellular antiviral mechanisms of action of calpain inhibitor XII by targeting both host cathepsin L
and viral Mpro.

with HCoV-OC43 virus at −1 h time point, viruses were incubated at 37 °C for 1 h for viral
attachment and entry. At time point 0 h, cells were washed with PBS buffer twice and viruses
from cell culture medium were harvested at 16 h p.i. The titer of harvested virus was determined
by plaque assay. Arrows indicate the period in which 10 μM GC-376 or 25 μM calpain inhibitor
XII was present. # indicates no virus was detected. Asterisks indicate statistically significant

Boceprevir, calpain inhibitors II and XII, and GC-376 directly bind to MERS-CoV, SARSCoV and HCoV-OC43 Mpro
First, we performed sequence alignment of Mpro from multiple members of coronavirus
family: HCoV-229E, HCoV-OC43, HCoV-NL63, SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV, and SARS-CoV-2
(Figure S1). Overall, the Mpros showed moderate to high similarity in primary sequence, and

comparatively high sequence similarity within each CoV group (Figure S1). It is acknowledged
that 3-D structures of the Mpros are more conserved, especially at the active site.25 Therefore, we
hypothesized that boceprevir, calpain inhibitors II and XII, and GC-376 might similarly bind to
other CoV Mpros in addition to SARS-CoV-2 Mpro. To test this hypothesis, we carried out
differential scanning fluorimetry (DSF) assay.26 Specific binding of a ligand to a protein
typically stabilizes the target protein, resulting in an increased melting temperature (Tm). It was
found that boceprevir, calpain inhibitors II and XII, and GC-376 increased the Tm of SARS-CoV,
MERS-CoV and HCoV-OC43 Mpro in a dose dependent manner (Figure 4), while remdesivir had
no effect on HCoV-OC43 Mpro stability at up to 200 µM. This was expected as remdesivir is a
known RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp) inhibitor.27 GC-376 significantly increased the
stability of all three Mpros when tested at 6 µM, with ∆Tm of 17.23, 9.78, and 13.86 ºC against
MERS-CoV, SARS-CoV and HCoV-OC43 Mpro, respectively (Figure 4, Table 1). Boceprevir,
calpain inhibitors II and XII also stabilized all three Mpros, but were less potent than GC-376.
Boceprevir increased the Tm of MERS-CoV, SARS-CoV and HCoV-OC43 Mpro by 2.46, 3.94,
and 1.02 ºC, respectively at 60 µM (Figure 4, Table 1). Calpain inhibitors II and XII increased
the Tm of MERS-CoV, SARS-CoV and HCoV-OC43 Mpro by 2.53, 2.88, 3.48 ºC and 0.81, 2.41,
1.54 ºC, respectively at 20 µM (Figure 4, Table 1). This result confirmed that boceprevir, calpain
inhibitors II and XII, and GC-376 had direct binding towards SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV, and
HCoV-OC43 Mpros in addition to SARS-CoV-2 Mpro, indicating they might be broad-spectrum
antiviral candidates.

Boceprevir, calpain inhibitors II and XII, and GC-376 inhibit the enzymatic activity of
MERS-CoV, SARS-CoV and HCoV-OC43 Mpro
To test whether boceprevir, calpain inhibitors II and XII, and GC-376 inhibit the enzymatic
activity of other CoV Mpros, we performed enzyme kinetic studies of MERS-CoV, SARS-CoV
and HCoV-OC43 Mpro with different concentrations of these four compounds (Figure 5). The
enzymatic reactions were monitored for up to 4 h, and the progression curves are shown in

Figures S2. As expected, similar to SARS-CoV-2 Mpro, all four compounds showed biphasic
progression curves at high drug concentrations, which are typical for slow covalent binding
inhibitors. The first 90 min of the progression curves shown in Figure S2 were chosen for curve
fitting as significant substrate depletion was observed when the proteolytic reaction proceeded
beyond 90 min. The progression curves of all three CoV Mpro in the presence of different
concentrations of GC-376 and MERS-CoV Mpro in the presence of different concentrations of
boceprevir were fitted using the two-step reaction mechanism as previously described (Figure
5).17 In the first step, GC-376 binds to MERS-CoV, SARS-CoV and HCoV-OC43 Mpro with an
equilibrium dissociation constant (KI) of 17.89 ± 2.34, 16.80 ± 2.36 and 3.63 ±0.26 nM,
respectively (Table 2). After initial binding, a covalent bond is formed at a slower velocity in the
second step between GC-376 and the Mpros with the second rate constant (k2) being 1.48, 0.87,
and 0.31 s−1, respectively, resulting in an overall k2/KI value of 82,910, 51,500 and 87,300 M−1
s−1, respectively (Figure 5A and Table 2). Boceprevir binds to MERS-CoV Mpro with a KI of 1.65
± 0.12 µM in the first step, and a k2 of 448.8 s-1 in the second step, resulting in an overall k2/KI
value of 272 M-1s-1 (Figure 5D and Table 2). When the proteolytic progression curves were fitted
using the same two-step reaction mechanism, accurate values for the second rate constant k2
could not be obtained for calpain inhibitors II and XII against all three Mpros as well as
boceprevir against SARS-CoV and HCoV-OC43 Mpros. This is presumably due to significant
substrate depletion before reaching the equilibrium between EI and EI*, leading to very small
values of k2. Therefore, only the dissociation constant KI values from the first step were
determined (Figure 5). The inhibition constants (KI ) for calpain inhibitors II and XII with
respect to MERS-CoV, SARS-CoV and HCoV-OC43 Mpro were 0.13 ± 0.012, 0.60 ±0.041, 0.23
± 0.0088 µM and 1.32 ± 0.070, 0.14 ± 0.012, 0.43 ± 0.015 µM, respectively; while the KI values

for boceprevir with respect to SARS-CoV and HCoV-OC43 Mpro were 1.43 ± 0.14, and 2.29 ±
0.19 µM, respectively. Taken together, the enzymatic kinetic results suggest that boceprevir,
calpain inhibitors II and XII, and GC-376 have broad-spectrum enzymatic inhibition against
SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV, and HCoV-OC43 Mpro.

antiviral activity against CoVs in cell culture. For this, cellular antiviral assays were performed
against multiple human CoVs including HCoV-229E, HCoV-NL63, HCoV-OC43, MERS-CoV
and SARS-CoV. Remdesivir was included as a positive control. It was found that all four
compounds showed potent antiviral activity against all the CoVs tested in the viral cytopathic
effect (CPE) assay in a dose-dependent manner (Figure 6). The 50% effective concentration EC50
values of GC-376 range from 99 nM to 3.37 µM (Figure 6 and Table 3). Calpain inhibitors II and
XII have comparable potency as GC-376, with EC50 values in the range of 84 nM to 5.58 µM,
and 100 nM to 1.97 µM, respectively (Figure 6 and Table 3). In contrast, boceprevir showed
moderate antiviral activity against all the CoVs tested and the EC50 values were over 10 µM in
most cases, except in the inhibition of SARS CoV-2 (EC50=1.31 ± 0.58 µM) (Figure 6 and Table
3). This result is in line with the weaker enzymatic inhibition of boceprevir against Mpros
compared with GC-376, calpain inhibitors II and XII (Table 2).

Data from reference.17 bN.T. = not tested
To test whether boceprevir, calpain inhibitors II and XII, and GC-376 inhibit viral RNA

synthesis, we performed the viral titer reduction assay using the RT-qPCR. HCoV-NL63 was
chosen as a representative example and the viral nucleocapsid (N) gene expression level was
detected in the absence or presence of different concentrations of compounds. Remdesivir was
included as a positive control. All four compounds inhibited HCoV-NL63 viral N gene
expression dose-dependently (Figure 7), giving EC50 values in the range of 0.96 to 19.86 µM
(Figure 7), which were comparable to the EC50 values determined in the antiviral CPE assays
(Table 3). Taken together, we have shown that boceprevir, calpain inhibitors II and XII, and GC376 have broad-spectrum antiviral activity against CoVs.

Combination therapy of boceprevir, calpain inhibitors II and XII, and GC-376 with
remdesivir
Combination therapy has several advantages compared to monotherapies including delayed
evolution of drug resistance, synergistic antiviral efficacy, and fewer side effects due to the lower
amount of drugs used.28 Combination therapy has been extensively explored for the treatment in
oncology, parasitic, bacterial and viral infections such as HIV and HCV.29-31 The combination
treatment potentials of boceprevir, calpain inhibitors II and XII, and GC-376 with remdesivir
were explored using HCoV-OC43 antiviral CPE assay. Combination indices (CIs) versus the
EC50 values of compounds at different combination ratios were plotted as previously described.32
The red line indicates additive effect; the right upper area above the red line indicates
antagonism, while the left bottom area below the line indicates synergy.32 In all combination
scenarios, the combination indices at all the combination ratios fell on the red line (Figure 8),
suggesting that boceprevir, calpain inhibitors II and XII, and GC-376 displayed an additive
antiviral effect with remdesivir in the combination therapy.

CONCLUSION
The COVID-19 pandemic emerged in late December 2019 in China has severe impacts on
public health and global economy. It is one of the worst global pandemics in history. The high
mortality rate and infection rate of COVID-19 is unprecedented. There has been three outbreaks
of highly pathogenic and lethal human coronaviruses within the past two decades,3-5 and the
current COVID-19 pandemic is a timely reminder of the urgent need for therapeutics of CoVs
infection. In this work, we report the broad-spectrum antiviral activity of our previously
identified SARS-CoV-2 Mpro inhibitors boceprevir, calpain inhibitors II and XII, and GC-376
against multiple CoVs including the highly pathogenic SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV, and human
coronaviruses NL63, 229E, and OC43. Coupled with their antiviral activity against SARS-CoV2 as reported earlier, this result suggests that these four compounds are promising drug
candidates for the further development of broad-spectrum antivirals against not only current
coronaviruses but also possibly future emerging coronaviruses. Among the four compounds,
calpain inhibitors II and XII had a novel mechanism of action by targeting both the viral Mpro
and host cathepsin L. In this study, we provided additional evidence from the pseudovirus
neutralization assay as well as the drug time-of-addition assay to support the contribution of
cathepsin L inhibition to the potent cellular antiviral activity of calpain inhibitors II and XII. We
further demonstrated the additive antiviral effect of boceprevir, calpain inhibitors II and XII, and
GC-376 with remdesivir in the combination therapy experiment.

It is known that CoVs enter host cells through two distinct pathways: the early membrane
fusion pathway and the late endosomal pathway. For the early membrane fusion pathway, the
transmembrane protease serine 2 (TMPRSS2) is responsible for the viral spike protein cleavage
and activation.33 In the late endosomal entry pathway, the cysteine protease cathepsin L mediates
the cleavage of spike protein.19 Several CoVs including SARS-CoV-2, SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV,
HCoV-OC43, HCoV-229E, and HCoV-NL63 utilize cathepsin L for host cell entry,19,

24, 34-37

which offers an opportunity to develop broad-spectrum antivirals by targeting the cathepsin L
protease. Indeed, cathepsin L inhibitors have been actively explored for the development of
coronavirus antivirals.38-40 Compared with mono-specific Mpro inhibitors, the dual inhibitors such
as calpain inhibitors II and XII that target both Mpro and cathepsin L might have additional
advantages of synergistic antiviral effect and also possibly increased genetic barrier to drug
resistance.
Although Mpro is relatively conserved among coronaviruses and picornaviruses, not all
3CLpro or 3Cpro inhibitors have broad-spectrum antiviral activity. For example, the well-known
3CLpro inhibitor rupintrivir inhibits the HCoV-229E with an EC50 value of 0.3 µM,41 however it
failed to inhibit the Mpro from both SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 Mpro.17, 41 This might be due to
the slight differences of residues located at the active sites of Mpro. Gratifyingly, we have shown
in this study that boceprevir, calpain inhibitors II and XII, and GC-376 inhibited multiple Mpros
from different members of the coronavirus family and had potent cellular antiviral activity
against all the coronaviruses tested. Among these four compounds, calpain inhibitors II and XII,
and GC-376 had single-digit to submicromolar antiviral potency with a high selectivity index,
while boceprevir had moderate antiviral activity. Nevertheless, boceprevir represents a novel
chemotype that warrants the further development. Moving forward, continuous optimization of

boceprevir, calpain inhibitors II and XII, and GC-376 might yield clinical candidates with
favorable pharmacokinetic properties and proven in vivo antiviral efficacy in animal models.
Such studies are ongoing and will be reported when available.

A pseudotype HIV-1-derived lentiviral particles bearing SARS-CoV-2 spike and a lentiviral
backbone plasmid encoding luciferase as reporter was produced in HEK293 T cells engineered
to express the SARS-CoV-2 receptor, ACE2 (ACE2/293 T cells), as previously described.21 The
pseudovirus was then used to infect Vero E6 cells in 96-well plates in the presence of DMSO or
serial concentrations of E-64d, boceprevir, calpain inhibitors II and XII, and GC-376. At 48 hpi,
cells from each well were lysed using the Bright-Glo Luciferase Assay System (Cat#: E2610,
Promega, Madison, WI, USA), and the cell lysates were transferred to 96-well Costar flat-bottom
luminometer plates. The relative luciferase units (RLUs) in each well were detected using
Cytation 5 Cell Imaging Multi-Mode Reader (BioTek, Winooski, VT, USA).
Drug time-of-addition experiment
A time-of-addition experiment was performed as previously described.42 Briefly, RD cells were
seeded at 1 ×105 cells/well in 12-well plate. 10 µM GC-376 or 50 µM calpain inhibitor XII was
added at different time points, as illustrated in Figure 3. RD cells were infected with HCoVOC43 at MOI of 0.1 at 24 h after seeding. Viruses in the supernatant were harvested at 16 hpi.
The virus titers were quantified by plaque reduction assay.
Differential scanning fluorimetry (DSF)
The binding of boceprevir, calpain inhibitors II and XII, and GC-376 on MERS-CoV, SARSCoV and HCoV-OC43 Mpro proteins was monitored by differential scanning fluorimetry (DSF)
using a Thermal Fisher QuantStudioTM 5 Real-Time PCR System as previously described43 with
minor modifications. TSA plates were prepared by mixing Mpro proteins (final concentration of 4

μM) with different concentrations of compounds (0.2 to 200 µM) and incubated at 30 °C for 1
hr. 1× SYPRO orange (Thermal Fisher) were added and the fluorescence signal was recorded
under a temperature gradient ranging from 20 to 95 °C (incremental steps of 0.05 °C/s). The

melting temperature (Tm) was calculated as the mid-log of the transition phase from the native to
the denatured protein using a Boltzmann model in Protein Thermal Shift Software v1.3. ΔTm was
calculated by subtracting reference melting temperature of proteins in the presence of DMSO
from the Tm in the presence of compounds. Curve fitting was performed using the Boltzmann
sigmoidal equation in Prism (v8) software.
Enzymatic assays
For the measurements of KM/Vmax and IC50 values, proteolytic reactions were carried out with
100 nM MERS-CoV, SARS-CoV or HCoV-OC43 Mpro in 100 µL of pH 6.5 reaction buffer (20
mM HEPES, pH 6.5, 120 mM NaCl, 0.4 mM EDTA, 4 mM DTT and 20% glycerol) at 30 °C in
a Cytation 5 imaging reader (Thermo Fisher Scientific) with filters for excitation at 360/40 nm
and emission at 460/40 nm. Reactions were monitored every 90 s. For KM/Vmax measurements, a
FRET substrate concentration ranging from 0 to 200 µM was applied. The initial velocity of the
proteolytic activity was calculated by linear regression for the first 15 min of the kinetic progress
curves. The initial velocity was plotted against the FRET concentration with the classic
Michaelis–Menten equation in Prism 8 software. For IC50 measurements, 100 nM Mpro protein
was incubated with 0.1 to 100 µM boceprevir, calpain inhibitors II and XII, and GC-376 at 30 °C
for 30 min in reaction buffer, then the reaction was initiated by adding 10 µM FRET substrate.
The reaction was monitored for 1 h, and the initial velocity was calculated for the first 15 min by
linear regression. The IC50 was calculated by plotting the initial velocity against various
concentrations of the compounds using a dose-response curve in Prism 8 software. Kinetics
measurements of the proteolytic reaction progress curves with boceprevir, calpain inhibitor II
and XII, and GC-376 were carried out as follows: 60 nM MERS-CoV Mpro, 5 nM SARS-CoV
Mpro, or 3.3 nM HCoV-OC43 Mpro was added to 20 µM FRET substrate with various

concentrations of compounds in 200 µL of reaction buffer at 30 °C to initiate the proteolytic
reaction. The reaction was monitored for 4 h. The progress curves were fitted as previously
described.17 Substrate depletion was observed when proteolytic reactions progress longer than 90
min, therefore only the first 90 min of the progress curves were used in the curve fitting. In this
study, k2 for boceprevir, calpain inhibitor II and XII, could not be accurately determined because
of significant substrate depletion before the establishment of the equilibrium between EI and EI*,
leading to very slow k2. In these cases, KI was determined with Morrison equation in Prism 8.
SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV CPE assays
Antiviral activities of test compounds were determined in nearly confluent cultures of Vero 76
cells. The assays were performed in 96-well Corning microplates. Cells were infected with
approximately 30 cell culture infectious doses (CCID50) of SARS-CoV or 40 CCID50 of MERSCoV. The plates were incubated at 37ºC with 5% CO2 and 50% effective concentrations (EC50)
were calculated based on virus-induced cytopathic effects (CPE) quantified by neutral red dye
uptake after 4 days of incubation for SARS-CoV or 3 days of incubation for MERS-CoV. Three
microwells at each concentration of compound were infected. Two uninfected microwells served
as toxicity controls. Cells were stained for viability for 2 h with neutral red (0.11% final
concentration). Excess dye was rinsed from the cells with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS). The
absorbed dye was eluted from the cells with 0.1 ml of 50% Sörensen’s citrate buffer (pH 4.2)50% ethanol. Plates were read for optical density determination at 540 nm. Readings were
converted to the percentage of the results for the uninfected control using an Excel spreadsheet
developed for this purpose. EC50 values were determined by plotting percent CPE versus log10
inhibitor concentration. Toxicity at each concentration was determined in uninfected wells in the
same microplates by measuring dye uptake.

HCoV-OC43, HCoV-229E, and HCoV-NL63 CPE assays
Antiviral activities of boceprevir, calpain inhibitors II and XII, and GC-376 against HCoV-229E,
HCoV-NL63 and HCoV-OC43 were tested in CPE assays as previously described44 with minor
modifications. Briefly, cell cultures near confluency in 96-well plates were infected with 100 µL
of viruses at desired dilutions and incubated for 1 h. Unabsorbed virus was removed and
different concentrations of testing compounds (0, 0.01, 0.03, 0.1, 0.3, 1, 3, 10, 30, 100 µM) were
added. Remdesivir was included as a positive control. The plates were incubated for another 3 to
5 days when a significant cytopathic effect was observed in the wells without compound (virus
only). Cells were stained with 0.1 mg/ml neutral red for 2 h, and excess dye was rinsed from the
cells with PBS. The absorbed dye was dissolved with a buffer containing 50% ethanol and 1%
glacial acetic acid. Plates were read for optical density determination at 540 nm. Readings were
normalized with uninfected controls. EC50 values were determined by plotting percent CPE
versus log10 compound concentrations from best-fit dose response curves with variable slope in
Prism 8. Toxicity at each concentration was determined in uninfected cells in the same
microplates by measuring neutral red dye uptake.
RNA extraction and real-time PCR
RNA extraction and RT-PCR were performed as previously described.45 Total RNA was
extracted from HCoV-NL63 virus infected Caco-2 cells at a MOI of 0.05 at 48 hours post
infection using TRIzol reagents (Thermo Fisher Scientific). 2.0

μg of total RNA was used to

synthesize the first strand cDNA of viral RNA and host RNA using SuperScript III reverse
transcriptase (Thermo Fisher Scientific) and Random Hexamer primer. Viral RNA was amplified
on a Thermal Fisher QuantStudioTM 5 Real-Time PCR System (Thermo Fisher Scientific) using
FastStart Universal SYBR Green Master mix (carboxy-X-rhodamine; Roche) and HCoV-NL63

(GAPDH-F:

ACACCCACTCCTCCACCTTTG-3′ and GAPDH-R: 5′-CACCACCCT GTTGCTGTAGCC3′). The amplification conditions were: 95 °C for 10 min; 40 cycles of 15 s at 95 °C and
60 s at 60 °C. Melting curve analysis was performed to verify the specificity of each
amplification. All experiments were repeated three times independently.
Combination therapy
Boceprevir, calpain inhibitors II and XII, and GC-376 was mixed with remdesivir at combination
ratio of 8:1, 4:1, 2:1, 1:1, 1:2, 1:4, and 1:8 separately. The mixture of each compound with
remdesivir at each combination ratio was serially diluted into 7 different concentrations and
applied in HCoV-OC43 CPE assay to determine EC50 of each compound and remdesivir in the
combination ratio. A combination indices (CIs) plot was used to depict the EC50 values of each
compound and remdesivir at different combination ratios. The red line indicates the additive
effect, and above the red line indicates the antagonism, while below the red line indicates the
synergy.32
