Summary

13

COVID-19, caused by SARS-CoV-2, lacks effective therapeutics. Additionally, no antiviral

14

drugs or vaccines were developed against the closely related coronavirus, SARS-CoV-1 or

15

MERS-CoV, despite previous zoonotic outbreaks. To identify starting points for such

16

therapeutics, we performed a large-scale screen of electrophile and non-covalent fragments

17

through a combined mass spectrometry and X-ray approach against the SARS-CoV-2 main

18

protease, one of two cysteine viral proteases essential for viral replication. Our

19

crystallographic screen identified 71 hits that span the entire active site, as well as 3 hits at

20

the dimer interface. These structures reveal routes to rapidly develop more potent inhibitors

21

through merging of covalent and non-covalent fragment hits; one series of low-reactivity,

22

tractable covalent fragments was progressed to discover improved binders. These combined

23

hits offer unprecedented structural and reactivity information for on-going structure-based

24

drug design against SARS-CoV-2 main protease.

A novel coronavirus, SARS-CoV-2, the causative agent of COVID-19 (Wu et al., 2020,
Kucharski et al., 2020, Zhu et al., 2020), has resulted in over one million confirmed cases and
in excess of 300,000 deaths across 188 countries as of mid-May 2020 (Dong et al., 2020).
SARS-CoV-2 is the third zoonotic coronavirus outbreak after the emergence of SARS-CoV-1 in
2002 and the Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS-CoV) in 2012 (Bermingham et al.,
2012, Kuiken et al., 2003, Zaki et al., 2012). SARS-CoV-2 is a large enveloped, positive sense,
single stranded RNA Betacoronavirus. The viral RNA encodes two open reading frames that,
through ribosome frame-shifting, generates two polyproteins pp1a and pp1ab (Bredenbeek
et al., 1990). These polyproteins produce most of the proteins of the replicase-transcriptase
complex (Thiel et al., 2003). The polyproteins are processed by two viral cysteine proteases:
a Papain-like protease (PLpro) which cleaves three sites, releasing non-structural proteins
nsp1-3 and a 3C-like protease, also referred to as the main protease (Mpro), that cleaves at 11
sites to release non-structural proteins (nsp4-16). These non-structural proteins form the
replicase complex responsible for replication and transcription of the viral genome and have
led to Mpro and PLPro being the primary targets for antiviral drug development (Hilgenfeld,
2014).

Structural studies have played a key role in drug development and were quickly applied
during the first coronavirus outbreak. Early work by the Hilgenfeld group facilitated targeting
the Mpro of coronarviruses (Hilgenfeld, 2014), and this was accelerated during the 2002
SARS-CoV-1 outbreak, leading to crystal structures of SARS-CoV-1 Mpro and inhibitor
complexes (Ghosh et al., 2007, Verschueren et al., 2008, Yang et al., 2005, Yang et al., 2003).
Coronavirus Mpro active sites are well conserved (Anand et al., 2003, Hegyi and Ziebuhr, 2002,
Stadler et al., 2003, Xue et al., 2008, Yang et al., 2005, Zhang et al., 2020b) and those of

enteroviruses (3Cpro) are functionally similar, which has led to efforts to develop broad
spectrum antivirals. The most successful have been peptidomimetic α-ketoamide inhibitors
(Zhang et al., 2020a), which have been used to derive a potent α-ketoamide inhibitor that
may lead to a successful antiviral (Zhang et al., 2020b).

To date, no drugs targeting SARS-CoV-2 have been verified by clinical trials and treatments
are limited to those targeting disease symptoms. To contribute to future therapeutic
possibilities, we approached the SARS-CoV-2 Mpro as a target for high throughput drug
discovery using a fragment-based approach (Thomas et al., 2019). We screened against over
1250 unique fragments leading to the identification of 74 high value fragment hits, including
23 non-covalent and 48 covalent hits in the active site, and 3 hits at the vital dimerization
interface. Here, these data are detailed along with potential ways forward for rapid followup design of improved, more potent, compounds.

We report the apo structure of SARS-CoV-2 Mpro with data to 1.25 Å. The construct we
crystallised has native residues at both N- and C--terminals, without cloning truncations or
appendages which could otherwise interfere with fragment binding. Electron density is
present for all residues, including 26 alternate conformations, many of which were absent in
previous lower resolution crystal structures. The protein crystallised with a single protein
polypeptide in the asymmetric unit, and the catalytic dimer provided by a symmetry-related
molecule. The structure aligns closely with the Mpro structures from SARS-CoV-1 and MERS
(rmsd of 0.52 Å and 0.97 Å respectively). The active site is sandwiched between two β-barrel
domains, I (residue 10-99) and II (residue 100-182) (Figure 1A). Domain III (residue 198-306),
forms a bundle of alpha helices and is proposed to regulate dimerization (Shi and Song, 2006).
The C-terminal residues, Cys300-Gln306, wrap against Domain II. However, the C terminal
displays a degree of flexibility and wraps around domain III in the N3 inhibitor complex (Shi
and Song, 2006) (PDB ID 6LU7). His41 and Cys145 comprise the catalytic dyad and
dimerisation completes the active site by bringing Ser1 of the second dimer protomer into
proximity with Glu166 (Figure 1B). This aids formation of the substrate specificity pocket and
the oxyanion hole (Hilgenfeld, 2014). Subsites have previously been identified in the active
site based on interactions with peptide-based inhibitors and are shown in figure 1B (Jin et al.,
2020, Zhang et al., 2020b). Comparisons with peptide-based inhibitor complexes (Jin et al.,
2020, Zhang et al., 2020b) suggest a degree of active site plasticity. In particular, the C-alphas
of Met49, Pro168, Gln189 respectively show movements of 2.8 Å, 1.4 Å, and 1.2 Å in
comparison to the α-ketoamide inhibitor bound Mpro structure (Zhang et al., 2020b) (PDB ID
6y2f, Figure 1B).

The crystal form is well-suited for crystallographic fragment screening: although the
percentage of solvent is very low for a protein crystal, approximately 20%, nevertheless clear
channels are present that allow access to the active site through diffusion. Moreover, the

Cysteine proteases are attractive targets for covalent inhibitors. To identify covalent
starting points, we screened our previously described library of ~1000 mild electrophilic
fragments (Resnick et al., 2019) against Mpro using intact protein mass spectrometry. Standard
conditions of 200 µM per electrophile for 24 hours at 4 °C did not allow discrimination
between hits. Screening at more stringent conditions (5 µM per electrophile; 1.5 hours; 25°C)
resulted in 8.5% of the library labelling above 30% of protein (Table S1a). These hits revealed
common motifs, and we focused on compounds which offer promising starting points.

117

Compounds containing N-chloroacetyl-N'-sulfonamido-piperazine or N--chloroacetylaniline
motifs were frequent hitters. Such compounds can be highly reactive. Therefore, we chose
series members with relatively low reactivity for follow up crystallization attempts. For
another series of hit compounds, containing a N-chloroacetyl piperidinyl-4-carboxamide
motif (Table S2) which displays lower reactivity and were not frequent hitters in previous
screens, we attempted crystallization despite their absence of labelling in the stringent
conditions.

While mild electrophilic fragments are ideal for probing the binding properties around the
active site cysteine, their small size prevents extensive exploration of the substrate binding
pocket. We performed an additional crystallographic fragment screen to exhaustively probe
the Mpro active site, and to find opportunities for fragment merging or growing. The 68
electrophile fragment hits were added to crystals along with a total of 1176 unique fragments

from 7 libraries (Table S3). Non-covalent fragments were soaked (Collins et al., 2017),
whereas electrophile fragments were both soaked and co-crystallized as previously described
(Resnick et al., 2019), to ensure that as many of the mass spectrometry hits as possible were
structurally observed. A total of 1742 soaking and 1139 co-crystallization experiments
resulted in 1877 mounted crystals. While some fragments either destroyed the crystals or
their diffraction, 1638 datasets with a resolution better than 2.8 Å were collected. The best
crystals diffracted to better than 1.4 Å, but diffraction to 1.8 Å was more typical, and no
datasets worse than 2.8 Å were included in analysis (Figure S2). We identified 96 fragment
hits using the PanDDA method (Pearce et al., 2017), all of which were deposited in the Protein
Data Bank (Table S2), but also immediately released through the Diamond Light Source
website (https://www.diamond.ac.uk/covid-19.html), along with all protocols and
experimental details. A timeline of experiments is shown in figure 2.

Eight fragments were identified that bind in the S1 subsite and frequently form interactions
with the side chains of the key residues His163, through a pyridine ring or similar nitrogen
containing heterocycle, and Glu166 through a carbonyl group in an amide or urea moiety
(Figure 3). Several also reach across into the S2 subsite.

Subsite S2 has previously demonstrated greater flexibility in comparison to the other
subsites, adapting to smaller substituents in peptide-based inhibitors but with a preference
for leucine or other hydrophobic residues (Zhang et al., 2020b). Many fragments bound at
this location, which we termed the “aromatic wheel” because of a consistent motif of an
aromatic ring forming hydrophobic interactions with Met49 or π- π stacking with His41, with
groups variously placed in 4 axial directions. Particularly notable is the vector into the small
pocket between His164, Met165 and Asp187, exploited by three of the fragments
(Z1220452176 (x0104), Z219104216 (x0305) and Z509756472 (x1249)) with fluoro and cyano
substituents (Figure 3).

163
164

166

Of the four fragments exploring subsite S3, three contain an aromatic ring with a
sulfonamide group forming hydrogen bonds with Gln189 and pointing out of the active site
towards the solvent interface (Figure 3). These hits have expansion vectors suitable for
exploiting the same His164/Met165/Asp187 pocket mentioned above.

The experiment revealed one notable conformational variation, which was exploited by one
fragment only (Z369936976 (x0397); Figure 4): a change in the sidechains of the key catalytic
residues His41, Cys145 alters the size and shape of subsite S1ʹ and thus the link to subsite S1.
This allows the fragment to bind, uniquely, to both S1 and S1ʹ. In S1, the isoxazole nitrogen
hydrogen-bonds to His163, an interaction that features in several other hits; and in S1ʹ, the

It is established that the biological unit for similar viral proteases, such as the SARS-CoV-1
protease is a dimer (Chou et al., 2004), and that mutations at the dimer interface can disrupt
proteases activity (Chen et al., 2008, Hsu et al., 2005) even at long range (Barrila et al., 2006).
Thus, compounds that interfere with dimerization might serve as quasi-allosteric inhibitors of
protease activity. In this study three compounds bound at the dimer interface.

Fragment Z1849009686 (x1086; Figure 5A) binds in a hydrophobic pocket formed by the
sidechains of Met6, Phe8, Arg298 and Val303. It also mediates two hydrogen bonds to the
sidechain of Gln127 and the backbone of Met6. Its binding site is less than 7 Å away from
Ser139, whose mutation to alanine in SARS-CoV-1 protease reduced both dimerization and
protease activity by about 50% (Chen et al., 2008, Hu et al., 2009). Z264347221 (x1187, Figure
5B) binds similarly in a hydrophobic pocket made by Met6, Phe8 and Arg298 in one of the
protomers, extending across the dimer interface to interact with Ser123, Tyr118 and Leu141
of the second protomer, including hydrogen bonds with the sidechain and backbone of
Ser123. Finally, POB0073 (x0887; York 3D library; Figure 5C), binds only 4 Å from Gly2 at the
dimer interface and is encased between Lys137 and Val171 of one protomer and Gly2, Arg4,
Phe3, Lys5 and Leu282 of the second, including two hydrogen bonds with the backbone of
Phe3.

In all structures with bound electrophiles, the N-chloroacetyl carbonyl oxygen atom forms
either two or three hydrogen bonds with the backbone amide hydrogens of Gly143, Ser144
or Cys145 (Figure 6 A-C). All three compounds containing the N-chloroacetyl piperidinyl-4carboxamide motif (Figure 6A) adopt a similar binding mode pointing towards the S2 pocket,
and one (PCM-0102389, x1358) is able to form an additional hydrogen bond with the side
chain of Asn142.

they point towards the solvent. Most of the latter 8 structures feature a halophenyl moiety

exploit lipophilic parts of S2, which is also recapitulated by the thiophenyl moiety in an
analogous carboxamide (PCM-0102306 (x1412)). The other five structures point mainly to S2,
offering an accessible growth vector towards the nearby S3 pocket.

A series of compounds containing a N-chloroacetyl piperidinyl-4-carboxamide motif showed
promising binding modes. To follow up on these compounds we performed a rapid secondgeneration compound synthesis. Derivatives of this chemotype were accessible in mg-scale
by reaction of N-chloroacetyl piperidine-4-carbonyl chloride with various in-house amines,
preferably carrying a chromophore to ease purification. These new compounds were tested
by intact protein mass-spectrometry to assess protein labelling (5 uM compound; 1.5h
incubation, RT; Table S1b). Amides derived from non-polar amines mostly outcompeted their
polar counterparts, hinting at a targetable lipophilic sub-region in this direction. The two
amides with the highest labelling PG-COV-35 and PG-COV-34 (figure 6G,H) highlight the
potential for further synthetic derivatization by amide N-alkylation or cross-coupling,
respectively.

The screen revealed unexpected covalent warheads from the series of 3-bromoprop-2-yn1-yl amides of N-acylamino acids. Colloquially termed PepLites (Noble and Waring), this
library was developed to map non-covalent interactions of amino acid sidechains in proteinprotein interaction hotspots, with the acetylene bromine intended, as for FragLites (Bauman
et al., 2016, Wood et al., 2019), as detection tag by anomalous dispersion in X-ray
crystallography. However, bromoalkynes can also act as covalent traps for activated cysteine
thiols (Mons et al., 2019) (figure 6D).

Two PepLites, containing threonine (NCL-00025058 (x0978)) and asparagine (NCL00025412
(x0981)) bound covalently to the active site cysteine (Cys145), forming a thioenolether via C2 addition with loss of bromine (Figure 6E,F). The covalent linkage was unexpected and
evidently the result of significant non-covalent interactions, specific to these two PepLites,
that position the electrophile group for nucleophilic attack. We note the side-chains make
hydrogen-bonding interactions with various backbone NH and O atoms of Thr26 and Thr24;
in the case of threonine, it was the minor 2R,3R diastereomer (corresponding to Dallothreonine) that bound. The only other PepLite observed (tyrosine, NCL-00024905
(x0967)) bound non-covalently to a different subsite.

The highlighted structure activity relationships is important for further optimisation.
Bromoalkynes have intrinsic thiol reactivity that is lower than that of established acrylamidebased covalent inhibitors (Mons et al., 2019), which is in general desirable. The geometry of
the alkyne and its binding mode also suggest that it could be replaced by reversible covalent
groups such as nitriles, which would be guided by the same non-covalent interactions but are
better established as cysteine protease inhibitors.

Heterocyclic electrophiles

277

Two covalent hits (2-cyano pyrimidine (Cov_HetLib 030 (x2097)) and 2cyano-imidazole
(Cov_HetLib 053 (x2119) came from a library of small heterocyclic electrophiles (Keeley et al.,
2019). These are essentially covalent MiniFrags (O'Reilly et al., 2019), comprising five and sixmembered nitrogen containing heterocycles with electron-withdrawing character that
activates small electrophilic substituents (halogenes, acetyl, vinyl and nitrile groups).

278
279
280
281
282
283
284

Both hits bound to Cys145 through an imine (Figure 6I,J), positioned by a local hydrogen
bond network involving imine and heterocyclic N atoms. One of these free amines provides
an immediate growth vector towards to catalytic pocket. The compounds have reasonable
stability in water (Keeley et al., 2018) and limited reactivity against GSH (t1/2= 2.2 and 52.3
h, respectively), well above suggested reactivity limits (Fuller et al., 2016). They are also
inactive against various covalent targets (HDAC8, MAO-A, MAO-B, MurA) and benchmark
proteins.

Discussion

286
287
288
289

The data presented herein provides many clear routes to developing potent inhibitors
against SARS-CoV-2. The bound fragments comprehensively sample all subsites of the active
site revealing diverse expansion vectors, and the electrophiles provide extensive, systematic
as well as serendipitous, data for designing covalent compounds.

It is widely accepted that new small molecule drugs cannot be developed fast enough to
help against COVID-19. Nevertheless, as the pandemic threatens to remain a long-term
problem and vaccine candidates do not promise complete and lasting protection, antiviral
molecules will remain an important line of defence. Such compounds will also be needed to
fight future pandemics (Hilgenfeld, 2014). Our data will accelerate such efforts:
therapeutically, through design of new molecules and to inform ongoing efforts at
repurposing existing drugs; and for research, through development of probe molecules
(Arrowsmith et al., 2015) to understand viral biology. One example is the observation that
fragment Z1220452176 (x0104) is a close analogue of melatonin, although in this case, it is
unlikely that melatonin mediates direct antiviral activity through inhibition of Mpro, given its
low molecular weight; nevertheless, melatonin is currently in clinical trials to assess its
immune-regulatory effects on COVID19 (Clinicaltrials.gov identifier NCT04353128).

In line with the urgency, results were made available online immediately for download.
Additionally, since exploring 3D data requires specialised tools (Ferla et al., 2020, Lee et al.,
2011), hits were made accessible on the Fragalysis webtool (https://fragalysis.diamond.ac.uk)
that allows easy exploration of the hits in interactive 3D.

We have previously demonstrated the benefits of merging covalent and non-covalent
fragments to make dramatic improvements in potency (Resnick et al., 2019). Our dataset
offers numerous opportunities and some conservative examples are shown in figure 7. These
can be expected to result in potent Mpro binders and compound synthesis is ongoing.

Collectively, the covalent hits provide rational routes to inhibitors of low reactivity and high
selectivity. Rationally designed covalent drugs are gaining traction, with many recent FDA
approvals (Singh et al., 2011, Bauer, 2015). Their design is based on very potent reversible
binding, that allows precise orientation of a low reactivity electrophile, so that formation of
the covalent bond is reliant on binding site specificity, with minimal off-targets. (De Cesco et
al., 2017, Zhang et al., 2019, Baillie, 2016). For this reason, covalent inhibitors are expunged
from high-throughput screening libraries and are typically considered as PAINS compounds
(Sirois et al., 2005, Baell and Nissink, 2018, Baell and Holloway, 2010). The challenge of tuning
reactivity, and the danger of reactivity-based artefacts, are likely to be particularly marked
for the highly reactive nucleophiles such as the catalytic cysteine of many proteases. This is
evidenced by the very high hit-rate we saw in our preliminary electrophiles screen in which
more than 150 fragments labelled Mpro by >50%. Robust characterization of the fragments’
reactivity (Resnick et al., 2019), and continuous evaluation of general thiol reactivity in the
selection of lead series and during hit-to-lead optimization can address this challenge.

The scale of this experiment, particularly the diversity of libraries and density of results,
likely sets a new benchmark for ensuring a crystal-based fragment screen accelerates
progression of hits. Even cursory inspection of the fragment structures indicates a very large
“merge space”, i.e. the collection of compounds that can be designed directly from spatial
juxtapositions of fragments. Such merges, which can be made to populate all four subsites,
might achieve potency synergistically, because the observed interactions can be assumed to
be in near-optimal configurations, given how few there are per fragment. A thorough
exploration of merge space might be best achieved formulaically, using computational
workflows that additionally filter undesirable molecular properties, assess synthetic
tractability and predict binding affinity. However, such integrated approaches are not
currently available in the public domain. We hope this dataset will help spur their
development and testing.

344
345
346
347
348

Another promising effort to explore the potential of this premise is the COVID Moonshot
project (https://covid.postera.ai/covid), where a selection of merges will be experimentally
tested, with data promptly made public. We trust that this resource will enable the
development of many new tools, approaches and ultimately viable treatment candidates for
COVID19.

Protein Expression: Multiple transformant colonies were used to inoculate a starter culture
supplemented with 100 µg/ml Carbenicillin. The culture was then grown to log phase for
approximately 8 h. 10 ml of the starter culture was used to inoculate 1 litre of Auto Induction
Medium supplemented with 10 ml of glycerol and 100 µg/ml Carbenicillin. The cultures were
grown at 37 °C, 200 rpm for 5 h then switched to 18 °C, 200 rpm for 10 h. The cells were
harvested by centrifugation and stored at -80 °C

Protein purification: Cells were resuspended in 50 mM Tris pH 8, 300 mM NaCl, 10 mM
Imidazole, 0.03 μg/ml Benzonase. The cells were disrupted on a high-pressure homogeniser
(3 passes, 30 kpsi, 4 °C). The lysate was clarified by centrifugation at 50,000 g. The supernatant
was then applied to a Nickel-NTA gravity column and washed and eluted with 50 mM Tris pH
8, 300 mM NaCl, and 25-500 mM imidazole pH 8. N-terminal His tagged HRV 3C Protease was
then added to the eluted protein at 1:10 w/w ratio. The mixture was then dialysed overnight
at 4 °C against 50 mM Tris pH 8, 300 mM NaCl, 1 mM TCEP. The following day, the HRV 3C
protease and other impurities were removed from the cleaved target protein by reverse
Nickel-NTA. The relevant fractions were concentrated and applied to an S200 16/60 gel
filtration column equilibrated in 20 mM Hepes pH 7.5, 50 mM NaCl buffer. The protein was
concentrated to 30 mg/ml using a 10 kDa MWCO centrifugal filter device.

Crystallisation and structure determination: Protein was thawed and diluted to 5 mg/ml
using 20 mM Hepes pH 7.5, 50 mM NaCl. The sample was centrifuged at 100 000 g for 15
minutes. Initial hits were found in well F2 of the Proplex crystallisation screen, 0.2 M LiCl,
0.1M Tris pH 8, 20% PEG 8K. These crystals were used to prepare a seed stock by crushing the
proteins with a pipette tip, suspending in reservoir solution and vortexing for 60 s in the
reservoir solution with approximately 10 glass beads (1.0mm diameter, BioSpec products).

Adding DMSO to the protein solution to a concentration of 5% and performing microseed
matrix screening, many new crystallisation hits were discovered in commercial crystallisation
screens. Following optimisation, the final crystallisation condition was 11% PEG 4K, 6% DMSO,
0.1M MES pH 6.7 with a seed stock dilution of 1/640. The seeds were prepared from crystals
grown in the final crystallisation condition. The drop ratios were 0.15 µl protein, 0.3 µl
reservoir solution, 0.05 µl seed stock. Crystals were grown using the sitting drop vapor
diffusion method at 20 °C and appeared within 24 hours.

Initial diffraction data was collected on beamline I04 at Diamond Light Source on a crystal
grown in 0.1 M MES pH 6.5, 5% PEG6K, cryoprotected using 30% PEG400. Data were
processed using Dials (Winter et al., 2018) via Xia2 (Winter et al., 2013). The dataset was
phased with the SARS-CoV-2 Mpro in complex with the N9 inhibitor crystal structure
(PDB:6LU7) using Molrep in CCP4i2. Further datasets were collected on I04-1 at Diamond
Light Source on crystals grown using the 0.1 M MES pH 6.5, 15% PEG4K, 5% DMSO condition.
To create a high-resolution dataset, datasets from 7 crystals were scaled and merged using
Aimless (Evans and Murshudov, 2013). Crystal structures were manually rebuilt in Coot
(Emsley et al., 2010) and refined using Refmac (Murshudov et al., 2011) and Buster (Bricogne

Electrophile fragment LC/MS screen: 2 µM Mpro was incubated in 50 mM Tris pH 8 300 mM
NaCl for 1.5 hours at 25 °C. For initial electrophile fragment library screen, 30 µl protein with
pools of 4-5 electrophile fragments, 7.5 nL each from 20 mM DMSO stocks and for other runs
50 µl protein with 0.5 µl compounds from 0.5 mM DMSO stocks. The reaction was quenched
by adding formic acid to 0.4% final concentration. The LC/MS runs were performed on a
Waters ACUITY UPLC class H instrument, in positive ion mode using electrospray ionization.
UPLC separation used a C4 column (300 Å, 1.7 μm, 21 mm × 100 mm). The column was held
at 40 °C and the autosampler at 10 °C. Mobile solution A was 0.1% formic acid in water, and
mobile phase B was 0.1% formic acid in acetonitrile. The run flow was 0.4 mL/min with
gradient 20% B for 4 min, increasing linearly to 60% B for 2 min, holding at 60% B for 0.5 min,
changing to 0% B in 0.5 min, and holding at 0% for 1 min. The mass data were collected on a
Waters SQD2 detector with an m/z range of 2−3071.98 at a range of 1000−2000 m/z. Raw
data were processed using openLYNX and deconvoluted using MaxEnt. Labelling assignment
was performed as previously described (Resnick et al., 2019).

Fragment Screening: Fragments were soaked into crystals as previously described (Collins
et al., 2017), by adding dissolved compound directly to the crystallisation drops using an ECHO
liquid handler (final concentration 10% DMSO); drops were incubated for approximately 1
hour prior to mounting and flash freezing in liquid nitrogen. The following libraries were
screened: the DSi-poised library (Enamine), a version of the poised library (Cox et al., 2016);
a version of the MiniFrags library (O'Reilly et al., 2019) assembled in-house; the FragLites
library (Wood et al., 2019); a library of shape-diverse 3D fragments (“York3D”) (Downes et al.,
2020); heterocyclic electrophiles (Keeley et al., 2019); and the SpotFinder library (Bajusz and
Keserü). All fragments were in 100% DMSO at varying stock concentrations, detailed at
https://www.diamond.ac.uk/Instruments/Mx/Fragment-Screening/FragmentLibraries.html).

Electrophile fragments identified by mass spectrometry were soaked by the same
procedure as the other libraries, but in addition, they were also co-crystallised in the same
crystallisation condition as for the apo structure. The protein was incubated with 10 to 20fold excess compound (molar ratio) for approximately 1h prior to the addition of the seeds
and reservoir solution (following Resnick et al (Resnick et al., 2019)).

approximately 1.8 Å using XDS (Kabsch, 2010) and either xia2 (Winter et al., 2013), autoPROC
(Vonrhein et al., 2011) or DIALS (Winter et al., 2018). Further analysis was performed with
XChemExplorer (Krojer et al., 2017): electron density maps were generated with Dimple
(Keegan et al., 2015); ligand-binding events were identified using PanDDA (Pearce et al., 2017)
(both the released version 0.2 and the pre-release development version
(https://github.com/ConorFWild/pandda)); ligands were modelled into PanDDA-calculated
event maps using Coot (Emsley et al., 2010); restraints were calculated with ACEDRG or
GRADE (Long et al., 2017, Smart et al., 2010); and structures were refined with Refmac

Synthesis of N-chloroacetyl-piperidine-4-carboxamides N-chloroacetyl piperidine-4carbonyl chloride was prepared as a stock solution in dry DCM under an atmosphere of N2.
Briefly, deprotecting N-Boc isonepecotic acid in 50% TFA in DCM (v/v) at RT for 2 h yielded
the corresponding TFA salt after evaporation of all volatiles. The crude TFA salt was then redissolved in DCM, treated with Et3N (2 equiv.), followed by the addition of chloroacetic
anhydride (1 equiv.). The reaction mixture was stirred overnight at RT, washed with water,
the organic phase dried over MgSO4, filtered, and all volatiles removed by rotary evaporation.
The crude N-chloroacetyl piperidine-4-carboxylic acid was refluxed in excess neat SOCl2 (gas
evolution and a colour change to red occurs) for 1 h, followed by removal of excess SOCl2 in
vacuum into a liquid nitrogen-cooled trap. The remaining residue was dried by rotary
evaporation, placed under an atmosphere of nitrogen and dissolved in dry DCM to give a stock
solution of approx. 0.489 M (based on theoretical yield over three steps), which was
immediately used.

Heterogeneous reaction mixtures were treated with a minimal amount of dry DMF to achieve
full solubility. After stirring the reaction mixtures overnight, the solvents were removed in by
rotary evaporation, re-dissolved in 50% aq. MeCN (and a minimal amount of DMSO to achieve
higher solubility), followed by purification by (semi-)preparative RP-HPLC in mass-directed
automatic mode or manually.
