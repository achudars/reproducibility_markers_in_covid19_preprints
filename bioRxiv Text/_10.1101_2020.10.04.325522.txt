Abstract

15

The severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) uses its spike (S) protein to mediate

16

viral entry into host cells. Cleavage of the S protein at the S1/S2 and/or S2’ site(s) is associated with viral

17

entry, which can occur at either the cell plasma membrane (early pathway) or the endosomal membrane

18

(late pathway), depending on the cell type. Previous studies show that SARS-CoV-2 has a unique insert at

19

the S1/S2 site that can be cleaved by furin, which appears to expand viral tropism to cells with suitable

20

protease and receptor expression. Here, we utilize viral pseudoparticles and protease inhibitors to study

21

the impact of the S1/S2 cleavage on infectivity. Our results demonstrate that S1/S2 pre-cleavage is

22

essential for early pathway entry into Calu-3 cells, a model lung epithelial cell line, but not for late pathway

23

entry into Vero E6 cells, a model cell line. The S1/S2 cleavage was found to be processed by other

24

proteases beyond furin. Using bioinformatic tools, we also analyze the presence of a furin S1/S2 site in

25

related CoVs and offer thoughts on the origin of the insertion of the furin-like cleavage site in SARS-CoV-

26

2.

Introduction

30

The 21st century has seen the rise of pathogenic strains of human coronaviruses (CoVs) causing major

31

public health concerns, first with the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) in 20021,

32

then with Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) in 20122, and now, with the severe

33

acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). SARS-CoV-2 causes the disease syndrome known

34

as COVID-193, now classified as a pandemic with global reach and impact.

35

CoV host cell entry is mediated by its spike (S) glycoprotein, a large transmembrane protein that decorates

36

the virus particle4. The S protein is demarcated into two domains, the S1 and S2 domain, which contains

37

the receptor binding domain and membrane fusion domain, respectively. There are two proteolytic

38

activation events associated with S-mediated membrane fusion5. The first is a priming cleavage that

39

occurs at the interface of the S1 and S2 domain (S1/S2) for some coronaviruses, and the second is the

40

obligatory triggering cleavage that occurs within the S2 region (S2’)5. The priming cleavage generally

41

converts the S protein into a fusion competent form, by enabling the S protein to better bind receptors or

42

expose hidden cleavage sites5. The triggering cleavage initiates a series of conformational changes that

43

enable the S protein to harpoon into the host membrane for membrane fusion5.

44

There are a variety of proteases capable of priming and triggering CoV S proteins. While the priming event

45

is not as well characterized and virus dependent, it has been observed that the CoV S can be triggered by

46

proteases at the plasma membrane or endosomal membrane, enabling entry in what are termed “early”

47

and “late” pathways, respectively6–8. SARS-CoV was found to utilize the transmembrane bound protease

48

TMPRSS2 to enter using the early pathway8–10. However, TMPRSS2 expression is limited to epithelial cell

49

lines, and in TMPRSS2 negative cell lines, SARS-CoV utilizes endosomal cathepsin L to enter using the late

50

pathway11. MERS-CoV also utilizes TMPRSS2 and cathepsin L with one major difference. The MERS-CoV

51

S1/S2 boundary contains an RSVR insert that can be recognized by furin or related proprotein convertases

52

(PC), proteases commonly found in the secretory pathway of most cell lines7,12. During the S maturation

53

process, the S protein can be cleaved by furin/PCs7,12. Thus, MERS-CoV particles harbor cleaved S1/S2

54

protein and it was observed that the S1/S2 priming (pre-cleavage) is crucial for MERS-CoV7, but not SARS-

55

CoV13, to infect via the early pathway route. However, the S1/S2 cleavage is not a requirement for MERS-

56

CoV late pathway infection7.

57

For SARS-CoV-2, early studies showed that the S1/S2 junction contains an insert with two additional basic

58

residues, P-R-R-A (P – proline, R – arginine, A – alanine), that was not present in SARS-CoV or its closest

59

bat ancestor viruses14,15. This insert forms a P-R-R-A-R sequence and while it does contain the minimum

60

furin recognition motif, R-X-X-R, it diverges from the preferred R-X-K/R-R motif, because the SARS-CoV-2

61

sequence has an A in the P3 location instead of an R16,17 (Figure 1). Intriguingly, the only other known

62

example of this insert on FurinDB18, a database of furin substrates, is found in proaerolysin, a bacterial

63

toxin, and was determined to be activated by furin19.

64

Indeed, early studies suggest that SARS-CoV-2 is also processed by furin since SARS-CoV-2 harbors a

65

cleaved S protein, likely due to furin processing at the S1/S2 site20–22. Similar to what was observed for

66

MERS-CoV, this S1/S2 cleavage was determined to be a prerequisite for subsequent TMPRSS2 activation

67

at the S2’ site for infection of respiratory cell lines, such as Calu-323,24. Furthermore, like MERS-CoV, SARS-

68

CoV-2 can also utilize cathepsin L in the endosomal pathway in TMPRSS2-negative cell lines, such as Vero

69

E622.

70

In this study, we sought to better characterize the SARS-CoV-2 S1/S2 cleavage site and raise some

71

intriguing possibilities for how the site might have emerged. Using pseudoparticles and protease inhibitors,

72

we investigated the impact of S1/S2 cleavage for successful infection of cells via the early and late pathway.

73

Our data shows that the S1/S2 cleavage is essential for subsequent S2’ activation via TMPRSS2 for entry

Results and Discussion

85

MLV pseudoparticles as a system to study SARS-CoV-2 entry. To assess the functional importance of the

86

S1/S2 site for SARS-CoV-2 entry, we utilized viral pseudoparticles. These particles consist of a murine

87

leukemia virus (MLV) core and are decorated with the viral envelope protein to accurately recapitulate

88

the entry steps of their native counterpart25. These particles also contain a luciferase reporter that

89

integrates into the host cell genome upon successful infection and drives the cells to produce luciferase,

90

which is quantifiable. We and others have used MLV-based pseudoparticles widely to study CoV entry

91

pathways12,21,26. Using the HEK293T cell line, MLV pseudoparticles containing the wild type SARS-CoV-2 S

92

protein (SARS-CoV-2pp), or the SARS-CoV S protein (SARS-CoVpp) were generated alongside positive

93

control particles containing the vesicular stomatitis virus G protein (VSVpp) or negative control particles

94

lacking envelope proteins (Δenvpp).

95

Since coronaviruses can enter via the ”early” or “late” pathway, we chose to infect cell lines representative

96

of each pathway, as the entry mechanism can be highly cell-type dependent27. We utilized the Calu-3

97

(early) and the Vero E6 (late) cell lines for these studies, which activate the SARS-CoV-2 S2’ using TMPRSS2

98

and cathepsin L, respectively. As expected, VSVpp (positive control) infected Vero E6 and Calu-3 cells with

99

several orders of magnitude higher luciferase units than the values reported with Δenvpp infection

100

(negative control) (Figure 2A, 2B). This confirms that the envelope protein is driving infection, and not the

101

particle itself. In the case of SARS-CoVpp and SARS-CoV-2pp, both particles are infectious in both cell lines

102

as they drive luciferase production several orders of magnitude higher than Δenvpp. (Figure 2A, 2B), with

103

SARS-CoVpp more infectious than SARS-CoV-2pp.

104

The pseudoparticles were also probed for their S content via western blot. For the SARS-CoV-2pp, we

105

detected a band at 85 kDa and for SARS-CoVpp, a strong band at 185 kDa (Figure 2C). The different bands

106

observed between SARS-CoV-2pp and SARS-CoVpp is likely because SARS-CoV-2 S is cleaved at the S1/S2

107

location by furin/PCs during biosynthesis, while SARS-CoV S cannot be cleaved. Thus, the 85 kDa band

108

corresponds to the S2 segment (S2) of the SARS-CoV-2 S, as the primary antibody recognizes the S2 region,

109

while the 185 kDa band corresponds to the uncleaved (S0) SARS-CoV S. We note that the both SARS-CoVpp

110

and SARS-CoV-2pp exhibit bands at >185 kDa that likely corresponding to dimeric and trimeric forms of S.

111

These oligomeric forms of S have been reported in other SARS-CoV-2pp western blots22,28. Since SARS-

112

CoVpp harbor full-length S, their oligomeric S bands are of higher molecular weight than the SARS-CoV-

113

2pp oligomeric S bands, which harbor cleaved S. Furthermore, the higher order bands may be more

114

apparent due to the use of a polyclonal antibody to detect both the SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 S.

124

Use of the dec-RVKR-CMK protease inhibitor to produce SARS-2pp with uncleaved S. To examine the

125

functional role of S priming by furin/PC proteases, we needed to produce SARS-CoV-2pp expressing

126

uncleaved S protein. This can be accomplished by treating producer cells with an appropriate protease

127

inhibitor to prevent S1/S2 cleavage during biogenesis. We chose dec-RVKR-CMK because it has been

128

shown to inhibit furin/PCs, preventing S1/S2 cleavage23,26,29. We have previously showed that addition of

129

dec-RVKR-CMK to producer cells generates MLV pseudotyped particles that harbor full-length MERS-CoV

130

S protein (MERS-CoVpp)26 and we observe a similar trend with SARS-CoV-2pp generated from cells treated

131

with dec-RVKR-CMK (Figure 3C, lanes 1 and 2), exhibiting full-length uncleaved S0 and weak cleaved S2

132

bands. As mentioned, the additional bands at >185 kDa likely corresponding to dimeric and trimeric S, as

133

previously reported in other western blots probing for SARS-CoV-2pp S22,28, with the higher order bands

134

from particles produced in cells treated with dec-RVKR-CMK observed at higher molecular weights.

135

The dec-RVKR-CMK-treated (uncleaved) particles were used to transduce cells to observe the impact of

136

S1/S2 cleavage for subsequent S2’ activation via early acting TMPRSS2 in Calu-3 cells or late acting

137

cathepsin L in Vero E6 cells. In Vero E6 cells, the uncleaved SARS-CoV-2pp were 30-fold more infectious

138

than their cleaved counterparts, suggesting that uncleaved particles result in more infectious particles,

139

and that the S1/S2 pre-cleavage is not required or hinders infection via the late pathway (Figure 3A).

140

However, in Calu-3 cells, the opposite trend was observed; the uncleaved particles were significantly less

141

infectious than their cleaved counterparts (Figure 3B), suggesting that S1/S2 pre-cleavage is essential23,24

142

for early entry. As a control, we also generated SARS-CoVpp, which lacks the furin/PC S1/S2 site, in the

143

presence or absence of dec-RVKR-CMK and noted no significant impact of dec-RVKR-CMK on SARS-CoVpp

144

infectivity in both Vero E6 and Calu-3 cells (Figure S1A and S1B). This affirms that the dec-RVKR-CMK

145

impacts on infectivity is due to blocking S1/S2 cleavage.

146

Thus, we were interested to see if we could restore the infection of the uncleaved particles by treating

147

them with exogeneous furin, which has been previously shown to process purified SARS-CoV-2 S protein30.

148

In Calu-3, we observed a 2-fold increase in infection when uncleaved particles were treated with

149

exogeneous furin, but with cleaved particles, we did not observe any statistically significant increase with

150

furin treatment (Figure 3B). In Vero E6 cells, for both types of particles, we did not observe a statistically

151

significant increase in infection with furin treatment. (Figure 3A).

152

Since furin treatment only modestly increased infectivity in all cases observed, we wanted to visualize

153

how efficiently furin was processing the SARS-CoV-2 S via western blot. For cleaved particles, exogeneous

154

furin processed the faint full-length S0 band into S2 (Figure 3C, lanes 1 and 3). This trend was confirmed

155

upon quantifying the intensities of the S0 and S2 bands relative to the intensity of the MLV p30 band; furin

156

treatment reduced the relative S0 intensity from 0.35 to 0.02, resulting in an increase in relative S2

157

intensity from 1.74 to 2.83. For uncleaved particles, furin treatment had a more modest impact, as the

158

relative intensity of the S0 bands was reduced from 2.61 to 2.25, resulting in a small increase in relative S2

159

intensity from 0.66 to 0.92 (Figure 3C, lanes 2 and 4).

160

The western blot bands also reveal that the relative intensity of the uncleaved SARS-CoV-2pp S0 bands are

161

greater than the relative intensity of the cleaved SARS-CoV-2pp S2 bands and this trend was previously

162

observed with MERS-CoVpp S26 (Figure 3C, lanes 1 and 2), but not with SARS-CoV (Figure S1C). This likely

163

suggests that the increased infectivity we observed with the uncleaved SARS-CoV-2pp in Vero E6 cells

164

could be due to particles harboring a greater amount of S protein. A possible explanation why uncleaved

165

particles could harbor more S is because uncleaved S is more stable than cleaved S, as S1/S2 cleavage

166

reduces S stability30. Thus, cleavage may encourage greater S degradation, reducing the amount of S

167

available for incorporation into pseudoparticles. However, we did not observe increased infectivity with

uncleaved SARS-CoV-2pp in Calu-3 cells because of the S1/S2 cleavage requirement and increased S

content cannot compensate for cleavage.

184

Due to the limited ability of exogenous furin to rescue and cleave SARS-CoV-2 S, we re-evaluated the role

185

of furin in processing the S1/S2 site. Since dec-RVKR-CMK can also inhibit a number of furin related PCs,

186

the effects that have been observed with dec-RVKR-CMK on particles could have resulted from inhibition

187

of other PC proteases and not necessarily furin. Therefore, we produced particles in the presence of

188

alpha1-PDX, a more selective furin inhibitor31 than dec-RVKR-CMK. Infectivity results of these particles in

189

Vero E6 cells show that the alpha1-PDX furin specific inhibitor failed to recapitulate the high level of

190

enhancement provided by dec-RVKR-CMK at all tested inhibitor concentrations (Figure 4A). This indicates

191

that dec-RVKR-CMK may have also been acting on non-furin proteases that can also process the S1/S2 site

192

and furin itself may not be the only protease processing the S1/S2 site, as is generally assumed.

193

As a control, the activity of the alpha1-PDX was confirmed using a proteolytic cleavage assay, in which

194

proteolytic cleavage of fluorogenic peptides results in a fluorescence increase used to determine the

195

velocity of the cleavage reaction (Vmax). We have previously used this assay to observe furin cleavage of

196

fluorogenic peptides mimicking the SARS-CoV-2 S1/S2 site (TNSPRRARSVA)32. Addition of the alpha1-PDX

197

or dec-RVKR-CMK inhibitor to a peptide reaction including furin resulted in almost complete inhibition of

198

activity, as very limited cleavage was detected. Interestingly, addition of the alpha1-PDX or dec-RVKR-

199

CMK to a reaction including trypsin gave different results. While alpha1-PDX did modestly inhibited

200

trypsin-mediated cleavage, dec-RVKR-CMK exhibited almost complete inhibition of trypsin activity. Thus,

201

the results of this peptide cleavage assay confirm that alpha1-PDX is active on furin-like substrates and is

202

a much more specific inhibitor compared to dec-RVKR-CMK (Figure 4B).

203

Our published results demonstrated that the PC protease PC1 can process SARS-CoV-2 S1/S232, which

204

opens up the possibility that non-furin proteases within the secretory pathway in producer cells can

205

process the SARS-CoV-2 “furin-like” S1/S2 site, as originally suggested by Coutard et al33. In the studies

206

reported here, we utilize HEK293T cells to produce the pseudoparticles, which may express a different

investigate the impact of S1/S2 processing by non-furin PCs in cells infected with SARS-CoV-2.

Furin-cleavage predictions of the SARS-CoV-2 S1/S2 site. To gain further insights on furin processing of

223

the S1/S2 sites, we utilized the PiTou34 and ProP35 cleavage prediction tools to analyze the likelihood that

224

the S1/S2 site is processed by furin. ProP predicts furin cleavage sites based on networks derived from

225

experimental data, whereas PiTou uses a combination of a hidden Markov model and biological

226

knowledge-based cumulative probability score functions to characterize a 20 amino acid motif from P14

227

to P6’ that reflects the binding strength and accessibility of the motif in the furin binding pocket. Thus,

228

the PiTou algorithm has been reported to be more sensitive and specific than ProP for predicting furin

229

cleavage34. Both algorithms agree with each other in predicting furin cleavage, with positive scores (PiTou)

230

and scores above 0.5 (ProP) indicating furin cleavage, strengthening the predictions (Figure 5), but since

231

the PiTou algorithm is more sensitive and specific, we decided to focus on the PiTou values for further

232

analysis.

233

The PiTou algorithm predicts that the SARS-CoV-2 S1/S2 site (PiTou score: 9.2) can be cleaved by furin,

234

whereas other lineage B CoVs that have been proposed as SARS-CoV-2 precursors, such as SARS-CoV,

235

RaTG13, ZC45, ZXC21 and RmYN02, are predicted not to be cleaved by furin. Notably, the PiTou scores of

236

traditionally accepted furin cleavage sites, such as those found in influenza H5N1 (PiTou score: 13.6) and

237

HCoV-HKU1 (PiTou score: 14.6), are much higher than for SARS-CoV-2, suggesting that while SARS-CoV-2

238

S1/S2 site has increased furin recognition when compared to other lineage B-betaCoVs, the site is not

239

optimal for furin cleavage, in alignment with the experimental data shown here suggesting poor furin

240

specific cleavage.

241

The modest SARS-CoV-2 PiTou score raises question about the origin and evolution of the S1/S2 site of

242

the virus. It is generally believed that the SARS-CoV-2 S1/S2 site is an insertion of “polybasic” residues36,

243

as occurs for avian influenza virus, but as the identity of the SARS-CoV-2 ancestor virus still remains to be

244

discovered, it is important to explore alternative explanations. It has recently been proposed that

17

245

unsampled SARS-like CoV lineages(s) may be circulating in bats, which are important for the evolutionary

246

origins of SARS-CoV-237. Of note, a “breakpoint sequence hypothesis” has been proposed for the

247

introduction of a furin-like cleavage site at S1/S238, an idea further elucidated by Lytras et al39 in the

248

context of the origin of SARS-like viruses. We consider that SARS-CoV-2 could have originated via

249

recombination with a currently unknown ancestor bat virus with a robust furin cleavage site (i.e. PiTou

250

score approx. 13-15), but one which cannot bind to a human receptor—and that in order to gain the ability

251

to infect human cells, the furin cleavage site may have been down-regulated.

252

These suggested parallels are informed by betaCoV lineage C in which MERS-CoV has a modest furin score

253

(PiTou score: 5.2), but its closest known ancestor bat viruses, BatCoV-HKU4 (PiTou score: <0), BatCoV-

254

HKU5 (PiTou score: 10.3), and BatCoV-PML (PiTou score: 2.175) exhibit a wide range of furin scores. Of

255

note is that the virus with the highest furin score, BatCoV-HKU5 (PiTou score: 10.3), cannot bind the MERS-

256

CoV hDPP4 receptor, whereas BatCoV-HKU4 (PiTou score: <0) can40, so the MERS-CoV S1/S2 site can be

257

seen as a down-regulation from BatCoV-HKU5 to bind hDPP4.

271

Overall, our results support observations23,24 that the role of this “gained” SARS-CoV-2 S1/S2 site is to

272

expand viral tropism to respiratory cells, likely in the upper airways, allowing efficient transmission.

273

Cleaved S1/S2 site is crucial for the SARS-CoV-2 S to be subsequently cleaved at the S2’ location by

274

TMPRSS2 for early entry in respiratory cells. Without the S1/S2 pre-cleavage, we predict that SARS-CoV-2

275

would be endocytosed and due to low cathepsin L expression in respiratory endosomes7, SARS-CoV-2

276

would not efficiently infect via this route. If SARS-CoV-2 infects TMPRSS2 negative cells, it can utilize

277

endosomal cathepsin L, an ubiquitous protease generally found throughout mammalian cells41, to activate

278

the S protein22—though at undetermined sites. However, for cathepsin L activation, S1/S2 pre-cleavage is

279

not required, and our results indicate that preventing this cleavage increases infectivity of SARS-CoV-2, at

280

least in Vero E6 cells. This may be connected to recent work showing that S1/S2 pre-cleavage reduces the

281

thermal stability of SARS-CoV-2 S30 and by preventing this cleavage, there is more S available for

282

incorporation into pseudoparticles. Interestingly, the S1/S2 site activation appears to also have a role in

283

the immune response against SARS-CoV-2, as it has been shown that SARS-CoV-2 S with a deleted S1/S2

284

loop can provide better protective immune response than with the S1/S2 loop42.

285

The role of furin in activating the S1/S2 site was also investigated. As protease inhibitors commonly

286

employed in cell entry studies, such as dec-RVKR-CMK, can also inhibit other proteases in addition to

287

furin29, it is difficult to ascertain the impact of individual proteases. While furin likely processes the SARS-

288

CoV-2 site, our data suggests that other PCs are also involved, since western blots show poor processing

289

of uncleaved S upon addition of purified furin and the use of a highly selective furin inhibitor (alpha1-PDX)

290

has a modest impact on infectivity. All in all, as we consider protease-based inhibitors in treating COVID-

291

19, especially those targeting furin43,44, it is important to thoroughly evaluate the role of these proteases

292

to be certain that the relevant proteases are targeted.

295

California) through modeler homology tool of the Modeller extension (v.9.25, University of California) as

296

described15. SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 S models were built based on the SARS-CoV S structure (PDB No.

297

5X58).

298

Cells, plasmids, and reagents. HEK293T (accession no: CRL-11268, ATCC), Vero E6 (accession no: CRL-1586,

299

ATCC), and Calu-3 (accession no: HTB-55) cells were maintained at 37°C and 5% CO2 incubator and

300

cultivated in Dulbecco’s Modified Eagle Medium (Cellgro) supplemented with 10% Hyclone FetalClone II

301

(GE) and 10 mM HEPES (Cellgro) (DMEMc). Cells were passaged using Dulbecco’s Phosphate-Buffered

302

314

Pseudoparticle production. Pseudotyped virus were produced from published protocols with minor

315

modifications25. Briefly, HEK293T cells were seeded to 30% confluency. Cells were transfected with pTG-

316

luc (600 ng), pCMV-MLV-gagpol (800 ng), and the respective viral envelope protein (600 ng) using

317

polyethylenimine for 48 hours. Supernatants were then harvested, centrifuged, clarified, and stored in -

318

80°C aliquots.

319

For + dec-RVKR-CMK particles, 7.5 µL of dec-RVKR-CMK was added to cells immediately after transfection

320

and boosted with an additional 7.5 µL 24 hours later (final concentration: 75 µM).

321

For alpha1-PDX particles, indicated concentrations were added to cells immediately after transfection, as

322

recommended by the manufacturer.

323

Pseudoparticle assays. Infection assays were as previously described with minor modifications25 in

324

triplicate. Briefly, target cells were seeded to confluency. Cells were washed with DPBS, infected with

325

particles on a rocker in an incubator with rocker for 1.5 hours. Cells were supplemented with DMEMc and

326

incubated for 72 hours. Cells were lysed and luciferase activity was assessed using the Luciferase Assay

327

System and the Glomax 20/20 luminometer (Promega). Infectivity values were analyzed and plotted using

328

Prism 8.

329

Exogeneous protease treatment. 1 mL pseudoparticles were pelleted using a TLA-55 rotor with an

330

Optima-MAX-E ultracentrifuge (Beckman Coulter) for 2 hours at 42,000 rpm at 4°C. Particles were

331

resuspended in 30 µL DPBS buffer supplemented with 20 mM HEPES, 0.2 mM CaCl2, 0.2 mM β-

332

mercaptoethanol (at pH 7.0). Particles were treated with 6 U recombinant furin for 3 hours at 37°C.

333

Western blot analysis of pseudoparticles. 3 mL pseudoparticles were pelleted and resuspended as

334

described above, but in 20 µL. Sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS) loading buffer and DTT were added to samples

335

and heated at 65°C for 20 minutes. Samples were separated on NuPAGE Bis-Tris gel (Invitrogen) and

336

transferred on polyvinylidene difluoride membranes (GE). SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV S was detected using

337

a rabbit polyclonal antibody that recognizes the S2 domain (Cat: 40590-T62, Sinobiological) and an

338

AlexaFluor 488 goat anti-rabbit secondary antibody. MLV protein was detected using a mouse monoclonal

339

antibody that recognizes the MLV p30 protein (Cat: ab130757, abcam) and an AlexaFluor 488 goat anti-

340

mouse secondary antibody. Bands were detected using the ChemiDoc Imaging software (Bio-Rad). S0 and

341

S2 band intensity was calculated using the analysis tools on Biorad Image Lab 6.1 software and normalized

342

to the MLV p30 band intensity.

343

Fluorogenic peptide assay. Peptide assays were as previously described with minor modifications32 in

344

triplicates. Each reaction was performed in a 100 μL volume consisting of buffer, protease, inhibitor, and

345

SARS-CoV-2 S1/S2 fluorogenic peptide in an opaque 96-well plate. For furin catalyzed reactions, 1 U/well

346

recombinant furin was diluted in buffer consisting of 20 mM HEPES, 0.2 mM CaCl2, 0.2 mM β-

347

mercaptoethanol. For trypsin catalyzed reactions, 0.8 nM/well TPCK trypsin was diluted in PBS buffer. The

348

alpha1-PDX inhibitor or dec-RVKR-CMK inhibitor were added at a concentration of 2 µM or 75 µM,

349

respectively. Peptide was lastly added at a concentration of 50 µM.

350

Fluorescence emission was measured every minute for 60 minutes using a SpectraMax fluorometer

351

(Molecular Devices) at 30°C using an excitation wavelength of 330 nm and an emission wavelength of 390

352

n. Vmax was calculated by fitting the linear rise in fluorescence to the equation of a line.
