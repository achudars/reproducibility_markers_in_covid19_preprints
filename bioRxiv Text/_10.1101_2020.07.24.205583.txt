ABSTRACT
Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) enters through
the airways and infects the lungs, causing lethal pulmonary damage in vulnerable
patients. This virus contains spike proteins on its envelope that binds to human
angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (hACE2) expressed on the surface of airway cells,
enabling entry of the virus for causing infection1,2. In severe cases, the virus enters the
circulatory system, contributing to multiorgan failure. Soluble form of hACE2 binds to
SARS-CoV-2 spike protein and prevents viral entry into target cells3. Moreover, soluble
recombinant ACE2 ameliorates lung injury4 but its short half-life limits its therapeutic
utility5. Here, we engineered synthetic mRNA to encode a soluble form of hACE2
(hsACE2) to prevent viral infection. Novel lipid nanoparticles (LNPs) were used to
package mRNA and transfect mammalian cells for enhanced production of secreted
proteins. Intravenously administered LNP led to hepatic delivery of the mRNA. This
elicited secretion of hsACE2 into the blood circulation within 2 h, and levels of
circulating hsACE2 peaked at 6 h and gradually decreased over several days. Since the
primary site of entry and pathogenesis for SARS-CoV-2 is the lungs, we instilled LNPs
into the lungs and were able to detect hsACE2 in the bronchoalveolar lavage fluid within
24 h and lasted for 48 h. Through co-immunoprecipitation, we found that mRNAgenerated hsACE2 was able to bind with the receptor binding domain of the SARSCoV-2 spike protein. Furthermore, hsACE2 was able to strongly inhibit (over 90%)
SARS-CoV-2 pseudovirus infection. Our proof of principle study shows that mRNAbased nanotherapeutics can be potentially deployed for pulmonary and extrapulmonary
neutralization of SARS-CoV-2 and open new treatment opportunities for COVID-19.

MAIN
More than 15 million cases with over 600,000 deaths have resulted from the
ongoing coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19)6. SARS-CoV-2, the pathogen of COVID19, is a β-coronavirus that primarily enters through the airways and lungs. The envelop
of SARS-CoV-2 is decorated with homotrimeric spike (S) proteins that bind to the
human angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (hACE2) receptor expressed on the cell
surface1,2. The S protein is composed of S1 and S2 subunits responsible for viral
attachment and fusion7, respectively. Binding between the receptor-binding domain
(RBD), which is located within the S1 subunit, and hACE2 triggers a cascade that
accelerates cellular entry and viral membrane fusion. hACE2 is expressed in the lungs,
heart, kidney, and intestine8. The inherent function of hACE2 is a key enzyme that
participates in the Renin Angiotensin Aldosterone System (RAAS) responsible to
maintain blood pressure. hACE2 is a carboxypeptidase that converts Angiotensin 1 to
Angiotensin (1-9) or Angiotensin II to Angiotensin (1-7), both of which are vasodilators
with cardioprotective effects through regulation of blood pressure9. SARS-CoV-2
interacts with hACE2 to enter and infect human airway epithelial cells, causing cytotoxic
responses. It also can develop pneumonia and cytokine storm, leading to Acute
Respiratory Distress Syndrome (ARDS) in severe cases10–12. Once the virus infiltrates
systemic circulation, it can dysregulate RAAS and immune system, cause endothelial
cell damage, possibly targets other tissues that express hACE2, and overall cause a
multiorgan failure13. hACE2 consists of three segments: an extracellular segment that
contains the peptidase domain where the RBD binds to, a transmembrane segment,
and an intracellular segment2. hACE2 can be cleaved by peptidases at the neck region

of the extracellular segment, releasing a soluble form of hACE2 (hsACE2) which is
enzymatically active14,15. Since the RBD of SARS-CoV-2 binds to the extracellular
domain of hACE2, hsACE2 protein can prevent the viral infection through competitive
inhibition14,15. Monteil et al. recently demonstrated that recombinant hsACE2 can inhibit
the infection of SARS-CoV-2 in cultured kidney organoids3. However, a relatively short
half-life of the recombinant hsACE2 in the bloodstream would necessitate repeated
administrations to ensure long-term circulation of the protein for days after exposure to
SARS-CoV-216. Chimeric hsACE2 that contains a fused Fc region of human IgG,
reduced viral infectivity in vitro; however, its pharmacokinetic benefit remains to be
determined17. A short half-life of soluble ACE2 (< 2 h in mouse) severely limits its time
window of action5 and extended residence of hsACE2 is desirable to mitigate SARSCoV-2 mediated RAAS activation and hence to reduce inflammation-related injury of
organs. To overcome these challenges, we use LNPs to deliver in-vitro-transcribed
messenger RNA (IVT mRNA) for rapid expression of hsACE2 (Fig. 1a-c). This strategy
may allow for rapid clearance of the captured virus while maintaining hsACE2 levels
that can surveil circulation, clear the virus, and rescue the disrupted RAAS system.
mRNA-based therapy has been attractive since the process of mRNA synthesis
became fast, affordable, and scalable18, and these advantages have enabled the fast
development of mRNA vaccines for COVID-1919,20. Moreover, LNP-delivered mRNA
provides a transient yet high expression of protein with proper folding and posttranslational modifications, but without risk of insertional mutagenesis as is associated
with viral-based gene therapy21. Unlike viral vectors, this platform technology can be
repeatedly administered to sustain protein production until the infection subsides and

cease of the treatment allows for clearance of hsACE2 within days, mitigating any offtarget effects. We hypothesized that expression of hsACE2 will prevent SARS-CoV-2
from binding to cell surface receptors and block its entry (Fig. 1a, b). We designed IVT
mRNA to encode the 1-740 amino acid sequence of hACE2 with a cleavable V5-epitope
tag at the C-terminus (Fig. 1c and Extended Data Fig. 1).
To confirm whether the designed IVT mRNA produces hsACE2 protein after
transfection, 293T cells were transfected with hsACE2 mRNA using lipofectamine 3000.
We detected the presence of hsACE2 protein in cell-free conditioned media and cell
lysates from hsACE2 mRNA transfected cells by western blot, but not in PBS-treated
controls (Extended Data Fig. 2a, b). Efficient intracellular delivery of mRNA, especially
in vivo, requires a potent delivery vector. Conventional LNPs are composed of four
lipids: (1) ionizable lipid, (2) PEG lipid, (3) cholesterol, and (4) structural lipid (Fig. 1d).
Recently, we discovered a simple substitution of cholesterol to β-sitosterol within LNP
formulations boosts intracellular delivery of mRNA22,23. We compared the enhanced
LNP formulation (eLNP: containing β-sitosterol) with the conventional LNP (containing
cholesterol) as the delivery vector for hsACE2 mRNA. Both LNP and eLNP
encapsulating hsACE2 mRNA (LNP or eLNP/hsACE2) exhibited comparable
characteristics in terms of hydrodynamic sizes (≈ 80 nm), polydispersity (PdI ≈ 0.08),
and RNA encapsulation (above 98%) (Extended Data Fig. 2c, d). We found that eLNP
encapsulating firefly luciferase (Fluc) mRNA generated significantly higher luciferase
expressions than LNP (p<0.01) with a dose-dependent manner in 293T cells without
decreasing cell viability, indicating improved transfection efficiency (Extended Data Fig.
3a, b). In hsACE2 mRNA delivery, eLNP/hsACE2 elicited substantially greater

production of hsACE2 protein compared to LNP/hsACE2 in cell-free conditioned media
from 293T culture. In the cell-free conditioned media from 293T cells treated with
LNP/Fluc and eLNP/Fluc, no expression of hsACE2 was detected in western blot
(Extended Data Fig. 3c). The improved hsACE2 expression by eLNP was confirmed
again in the analysis of cell lysates (5-fold higher expression, p < 0.0001) (Extended
Data Fig. 3d, e). Additionally, the production of hsACE2 protein was dependent on the
mRNA dose given (Fig. 2a).
Accumulating evidence suggests that invasion of SARS-CoV-2 in ACE2expressing airway epithelial cells is followed by infection of endothelial cells, leading to
endotheliitis24,25. Vascular leakage caused by damaged endothelial cells provides the
virus with a putative gateway to the circulatory system and other ACE2-expressing
organs25. Therefore, blockade of influx of the virus from the blood circulation to
peripheral organs is likely to prevent multisystem organ failure. For these reasons, we
evaluated in vivo delivery of eLNP/hsACE2 for production, secretion, and blood
circulation of hsACE2 protein. Intravenously administered LNPs are typically destined to
transfect hepatocytes owing to the interaction between LNP and apolipoprotein E26.
Thus, we expected the liver will serve as a factory for protein production upon hsACE2
mRNA transfection as shown in other studies for secretory proteins27,28. To demonstrate
this in vitro, the human liver cell line, Hep G2, was transfected with LNPs. eLNP/Fluc
yielded more luciferase expression than LNP/Fluc in Hep G2 cells (Extended Data Fig.
4a, b). As was the case with 293T cells, hsACE2 protein was found within the cell-free
conditioned media and lysates that were harvested from the transfected Hep G2 cells in
a dose-dependent manner (Fig. 2b and Extended Data Fig. 4c, d). Interestingly, in the

Hep G2 cell lysates, two discrete hsACE2 bands were observed. We assume the band
at approximately 125 kDa represented the fully-glycosylated form and the band at 100
kDa represented the pre- or partially-glycosylated form (Extended Data Fig. 4c).
However, only the fully-glycosylated form was detected in the cell-free media (Fig. 2b),
suggesting the glycosylation of hsACE2 protein is prior to secretion. We then examined
whether the eLNP lead to improved protein production in vivo. It was shown that
eLNP/Fluc induced strong bioluminescent signals in the livers of BALB/c mice after
intravenous injection of LNPs at 4 hours post-injection, which decreased with time (Fig.
2c). eLNP/Fluc exhibited 3-fold increase in luciferase expression as compared to
LNP/Fluc at all time points (4-48 h) (Fig. 2d). Based on these results, we used eLNP as
an optimized formulation for delivering mRNA in the remaining studies. We injected
eLNP/hsACE2 in BALB/c mice and collected mouse sera up to 72 h post-administration
with predetermined time intervals. Notably, hsACE2 appeared in the mouse sera as
early as 2 h post-injection (Fig. 2e and Extended Data Fig. 5b, c). This rapid
generation of hsACE2 from the liver will be useful to neutralize SARS-CoV-2 promptly at
a stage of systemic spread. We found that hsACE2 was detected at the highest level at
6 h post-injection and gradually declined afterwards. We could detect circulating
hsACE2 even 72 h after a single injection (Fig. 2e, f and Extended Data Fig. 5a). The
expression of hsACE2 protein in liver homogenates was time-dependent, showing a
greater expression of the protein after 6 h than 24 h post-administration (p < 0.001)
(Fig. 2g, h). Unlike the cell lysates of Hep G2, the mouse liver homogenates showed a
single band at approximately 125 kDa. After 7 days, hsACE2 was mostly eliminated
from the blood circulation (data not shown).

Airway and lungs are the first target organs where the virus attacks and are
highly vulnerable organs due to high levels of hACE2 expression14. Having hsACE2
protein as a decoy on the airway epithelium could mitigate viral infection at early stages
of disease progression. Therefore, we explored the ability of LNPs to produce mucosal
hsACE2. Consistent with the previous results, eLNP/Fluc exerted significantly greater
levels of transfection than LNP/Fluc in Calu-3, a human lung epithelial cell line (Fig. 3a,
Extended Data Fig. 6a). Similarly, eLNP/hsACE2 showed substantially higher
expression of hsACE2 protein than LNP/hsACE2 in western blot (Fig. 3b and
Extended Data Fig. 6c, d). To locally deliver LNPs to the mouse lungs, we used
intratracheal instillation as the route of administration. Intratracheally administered
eLNP/Fluc transfected the lungs of BALB/c mouse, and the luciferase expression was
detected exclusively in the lungs (Fig. 4c, d). To evaluate the secretion of hsACE2 to
the lung mucosa, bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF) samples were collected at 24 h
and 48 h post-administration of eLNP/hACE2, followed by pull-down of hsACE2 protein
using anti-V5 antibody. We confirmed the presence of mucosal hsACE2 in the collected
BALF samples by western blot (Fig. 3e). These data represent that lung transfection
with eLNP/hsACE2 resulted in the secretion of hsACE2 to the airway mucus.
Next, we evaluated whether there was a physical interaction of hsACE2 protein
with the RBD of SARS-CoV-2. 293T cells were transfected with eLNP/hsACE2 for 24 h,
and untreated cells served as controls. Cell-free conditioned media was collected and
inoculated with either PBS or the recombinant His-tagged RBD (Fig. 4a, b). Coimmunoprecipitation was performed with the samples using anti-V5 antibody to capture
hsACE2V5 (Fig. 4b, c). SDS-PAGE was performed with the immunoprecipitated

samples and the flow-through samples, followed by immunoblotting with anti-V5 and
anti-His antibodies. It was observed that anti-V5 antibody was able to
immunoprecipitate the hsACE2V5 from cell-free conditioned media (Fig. 4c) while the
unbound hsACE2 V5 was detected in the flow-through samples (Fig. 4d). The RBDHis
was detected only in the immunoprecipitated samples that had both hsACE2 and the
RBD (Fig. 4c) while the samples that contained RBDHis or hsACE2 alone showed no
RBDHis band in the immunoprecipitated samples (Fig. 4c). The unbound RBDHis and
hsACE2 were clearly detected in the flow-through samples (Fig. 4d). We also
conducted a reciprocal co-immunoprecipitation, in which anti-His antibody was used to
capture RBDHis (Fig. 4e, f). It was observed that anti-His antibody coimmunoprecipitated hsACE2V5 in the samples that contained both hsACE2V5 and
RBDHis. hsACE2V5 band did not appear in the samples from other groups in
immunoblotting. These results demonstrate that hsACE2 protein formed a protein
complex with a specific and high-affinity association with the RBD of SARS-CoV-2. We
further explored the ability of hsACE2 to inhibit the transduction of the virus using a
pseudovirus neutralization assay. To investigate hACE2-dependent infection of the
pseudovirus, we created 293T cells stably expressing hACE2 (293T-hACE2) with a
lentiviral vector. Expression of hACE2 in the transduced cells was examined in western
blot, which showed hACE2 band at approximately 115 kDa (Extended Data Fig. 7a).
For pseudotyping the SARS-CoV-2, we utilized Fluc-packaged HIV-based lentiviral
particles containing the S protein of SARS-CoV-2 on them. The lentiviral particles with
vesicular stomatitis virus G protein (VSV-G) instead of the S protein were prepared as a
positive control. We found the spike pseudovirus infection was hACE2-dependent; while

VSV-G pseudovirus infection was not affected by hACE2 expression in host cells
(Extended Data Fig. 7b). After we examined the hACE2 specificity of the spike
pseudovirus, we studied the effects of hsACE2 on the pseudovirus infection. To do this,
hsACE2 conditioned media was produced by transfecting hsACE2 mRNA in 293T/17
cells. The pseudovirus and conditioned media containing hsACE2 were co-incubated on
293T-hACE2 cells and we measured viral transduction. It was found that cells treated
with hsACE2 conditioned media led to a drastic reduction (more than 95%) of
pseudovirus transduction as compared to the cells treated with pseudovirus alone (Fig.
4g). The VSV-G pseudovirus transduction was not affected by either treatment (Fig.
4h). These data highlight the potent inhibitory effect of hsACE2 treatment on the SARSCoV-2 infection by blocking the S protein-mediated viral attachment.
There is an urgent need for developing effective treatment options to tackle this
pandemic19,29. Remdesivir, an investigational antiviral drug, has shown encouraging
evidence in improving time of recovery among patients. The overall mortality rate
however remains unchanged while conflicting reports have emerged on clinical
outcomes30,31. Dexamethasone, an anti-inflammatory steroid repurposed for COVID-19,
was shown to lower mortality in the patients when used in conjunction with respiratory
support32. In this study, we demonstrate that mRNA-based nanotherapeutic produces
the decoy hsACE2 protein to potentially inhibit the SARS-CoV-2 infection. Using a
potent LNP formulation (eLNP), IVT mRNA was delivered to the cytosol and translated
into hsACE2 protein more efficiently than the conventional LNPs. hsACE2 protein that
was generated from the LNP-delivered mRNA efficiently bound to the RBD of SARSCoV-2 with a high affinity. Additionally, hsACE2 exerted a potent neutralizing effect on

the pseudovirus decorated with the S protein of SARS-CoV-2. Intravenous injection of
eLNP/hsACE2 enabled rapid and sustained expression of the circulating hsACE2
protein in the blood circulation within 2 h, which peaked at 6 h and cleared gradually.
Lung transfection with eLNP/hsACE2 elicited secretion of hsACE2 protein to the airway
mucus in which the primary infection of SARS-CoV-2 occurs. Unlike Fc fragment fused
chimeric hsACE2 protein, the availability of mRNA derived circulating hsACE2 is due to
continuous generation of new protein from the liver. This provides an opportunity for
rapid clearance of the virus while providing protection against the dysregulated RAAS
system due to long term presence of newly made protein in the serum. Another use of
recombinant hsACE2 was to regulate blood pressure in the Angiotensin II-dependent
hypertension33. The prevalence of hypertension among the elderly in the United States
is more than 60%34 and this age-group is also at high risk of COVID-1935. In this regard,
it is conceivable that expression of enzymatically active hsACE2 from the mRNA
therapy could protect COVID-19 patients with hypertension from aggravation of
cardiovascular diseases as well as viral infection. Given that binding SARS-CoV-1 to
ACE2 results in reduced receptor expression that is associated with SARS-associated
ARDS and soluble ACE2 provides protection against virus mediated lung injury4,36, it is
likely that sustained expression of hsACE2 during infection could facilitate ACE2mediated lung protection, reduce the incidence of ARDS by neutralizing SARS-CoV-2,
and prevent RAAS dysregulation. Additionally, hsACE2 is posited to bind SARS-CoV-2
in the bloodstream and reduce their ability to infect other peripheral organs. It is
possible that, by binding and thus masking the RBD, hsACE2 may decrease the
amplitude of inflammatory response that causes multiorgan failure.

Our studies are currently limited to the interactions of mRNA-derived hsACE2
with the viral RBD and the ability of hsACE2 mRNA therapy to inhibit cellular entry of
the SARS-CoV-2 pseudotyped virus. The affinity of hsACE2 protein to the S protein on
the envelop of SARS-CoV-2 could be different, which could have an effect on inhibition
of the virus infection. To address these questions, we plan to continue studies that will
inform whether LNP-delivered hsACE2 can inhibit live SARS-CoV-2 in vitro. For in vivo
validation, we intend to use hACE2-transgenic animals that express similar
pathogenesis when infected with the SAR-CoV-237,38. With the further characterization
of mRNA-based hsACE2 treatment, the continued development of inhalable forms of
LNPs could enable ease of repeated administration to the patients until the pulmonary
infection subsides.
An array of mRNA-based vaccines are progressing with unprecedented speed to
effectively end this pandemic19,20. mRNA-based nanotherapeutics that produce hsACE2
or neutralizing antibodies in combination with antiviral therapies can emerge as
treatment options against SARS-CoV-2 infection. Furthermore, the mRNA-based
approach can lead to the development of treatments based on high affinity hsACE2
variants that bind the RBD of SARS-CoV-2 or other hACE2-exploiting coronaviruses
that may spill in the future. We hope this work brings to light the potential of mRNAbased therapeutics to treat patients suffering with COVID-19.

METHODS
Materials:
Fluc mRNA and hsACE2 variant mRNA were purchased from TriLink Biotechnologies
(CA, USA). Uridine of Fluc mRNA was fully substituted with 5-methoxyuridine, and
uridine and cytidine of hsACE2 mRNA were fully substituted with pseudouridine and 5methyl-cytidine, respectively. Cholesterol and β-sitosterol were purchased from SigmaAldrich. DMG-PEG2K was bought from NOF America. DLin-MC3-DMA and DSPC were
obtained from BioFine International Inc. and Avanti Polar Lipids, Inc., respectively.

LNP formulation and characterization:
LNPs composed of DLin-MC3-DMA, Cholesterol or β-sitosterol, DMG-PEG2K, DSPC,
and mRNA were prepared using microfluidic mixing as described previously39. Briefly,
mRNA was diluted in sterile 50 mM citrate buffer, and lipid components were prepared
in 100% ethanol at 50:38.5:1.5:10 molar ratio. The lipid and mRNA solutions were
mixed using the NanoAssemblr Benchtop at a 1:3 ratio, followed by overnight dialysis
against sterile PBS using a Slide-A-Lyzer G2 cassette with 10,000 Da molecular-weightcut-off (Thermo Fisher Scientific). Dialyzed LNP solutions were concentrated using
Amicon® Ultra centrifugal filter units with 10,000 Da molecular-weight-cut-off (Millipore).
Hydrodynamic size and PDI of the LNPs were measured in dynamic light scattering
using the Zetasizer Nano ZSP (Malvern Instruments, UK). mRNA encapsulation was
assayed using a Quant-iTTM RiboGreen® RNA Assay kit (Thermo Fisher Scientific) and
a multimode microplate reader (Tecan Trading AG, Switzerland).

Cell culture
293T, Calu-3, Hep G2 cell lines were kindly gifted from Prof. Sadik Esener (OHSU),
Prof. Kelvin MacDonald (OHSU), and Prof. Conroy Sun (OSU), respectively. 293T/17
cell line was purchased from ATCC (CRL-11268). 293T, 293T/17 and Hep G2 cells
were cultured in DMEM supplemented with 10% heat-inactivated FBS and 1%
penicillin/streptomycin. Calu-3 cells were cultured in MEM supplemented with 10% heatinactivated FBS, 1% penicillin/streptomycin, non-essential amino acids, and sodium
pyruvate.

In vitro Fluc mRNA transfection assay
For in vitro Fluc mRNA transfection assays, cells were seeded on a white 96 well plate
at 4×103 cells/well for 293T and Hep G2 cells or at 104 cells/well for Calu-3, followed by
overnight incubation for cell attachment. Cells were incubated with nanoparticles
encapsulating Fluc mRNA and analyzed for cell viability and luciferase activity with the
ONE-GloTM+Tox luciferase reporter and cell viability assay kit (Promega) using a
multimode microplate reader.

In vitro hsACE2 mRNA transfection
For in vitro mRNA transfection for hsACE2 production, cells were seeded on a 12-well
plate at 3×105 cells per well and allowed to attach for overnight. Cells were treated with
LNPs encapsulating hsACE2 mRNA for 24 h, and culture media were centrifuged at 500
g for 10 min at 4°C. Cell-free media was supplemented with protease and phosphatase
inhibitor cocktail (Thermo Fisher Scientific) and used for downstream experiments.

Besides culture media, transfected cells were lysed using RIPA buffer containing
protease and phosphatase inhibitor cocktail, followed by centrifugation at 16,000 g for
30 min at 4°C. Supernatant lysate was collected for western blot.

Detection of hsACE2 protein by western blot
Production of hsACE2 protein upon transfection was detected by western blot. In brief,
total protein concentration of sample was quantified using a Micro BCA protein assay kit
(Thermo Fisher Scientific) according to the manufacturer’s instruction. Cell-free
supernatants or cell lysates containing 30 µg of total protein were prepared in 1X LDS
sample buffer under reducing conditions, denatured at 70°C for 10 min, and run on 412% Bis-Tris gels or 4-20% Tris-glycine gels, followed by dry transfer to PVDF
membrane using iBlot 2 Dry Blotting System (Thermo Fisher Scientific). The blots were
blocked using 5% skim milk for 1 h at room temperature. The primary antibodies used
were: rabbit monoclonal anti-V5 tag at 1:1,000 (Cell Signaling Technology, 13202),
rabbit monoclonal anti-6x-His tag at 1:1,000 (Thermo Fisher Scientific, MA5-33032),
and mouse monoclonal anti-β-actin at 1:10,000 (R&D Systems, MAB8929). The
secondary antibodies used were goat polyclonal anti-rabbit HRP (Jackson

Co-immunoprecipitation of hsACE2 and SARS-CoV-2 Spike RBD
Cell free media from untreated or transfected 293T cell culture was prepared. 1 µg of
SARS-CoV-2 Spike RBD-His (Sino Biological) was inoculated to 400 µl of cell free
media, followed by overnight incubation at 4°C with rotation. Subsequent coimmunoprecipitation was conducted using DynabeadsTM Protein G Immunoprecipitation
kit (Thermo Fisher Scientific) according to the manufacturer’s instruction. Briefly, cellfree media inoculated with the spike RBD were incubated with antibody bound
Dynabeads for 20 min at room temperature with rotation. The antibodies used for pulldown were mouse monoclonal anti-His tag (sc-8036) or anti-V5 tag (sc-81594) antibody
(Santa Cruz Biotechnology). Following three washes with PBS, samples were eluted
using elution buffer and denatured using LDS sample buffer and reducing agent for
western blot.

Animals
All animal studies were conducted at Oregon Health and Sciences University and
approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee (IACUC, IP00001707).

In vivo Fluc mRNA transfection via intravenous administration
Female BALB/c mice (8-12 weeks) were sedated using isoflurane, and LNPs
encapsulating Fluc mRNA were intravenously administered via tail vein. At
predetermined time points post-administration, 200 µl of D-luciferin substrate was
intraperitoneally injected to the mice 10 minutes prior to bioluminescence imaging (150

mg/kg). Image acquisition and analysis were performed using the IVIS® Lumina XRMS
and the manufacturer’s software (PerkinElmer).

In vivo hsACE2 mRNA transfection via intravenous administration
Female BALB/c mice (8-12 weeks) were sedated using isoflurane, and LNPs
encapsulating hsACE2 mRNA were administered to animals via tail vein. At
predetermined time points post-administration, whole blood was collected using cardiac
puncture or submandibular bleeding. The collected blood samples were processed to
sera using serum-separating tubes (BD). The separated sera were used for
downstream experiments. Mouse liver were sterilely harvested and homogenized using
a handheld tissue homogenizer.

In vivo mRNA transfection via intratracheal instillation
Intratracheal instillation was performed as described previously40. Female BALB/c mice
(8-12 weeks) were anesthetized using ketamine/xylazine cocktail. Anesthetized animals
were leaned over intubation stand (Kent Scientific), and their vocal cords were directly
visualized using an otoscope with a 2-mm speculum (Welch Allyn). A flexible guide wire
was advanced through the vocal cords to trachea. Once the wire was located within
trachea, a 20 G catheter was passed over the wire and the wire was removed. To
administer LNPs, a gas tight syringe with a 22 G blunt needle (Hamilton) was filled with
LNPs containing mRNA. The syringe were inserted through the catheter and LNPs
encapsulating mRNA was administered to lungs, followed by 100 µl of air to distribute
the LNP solution throughout the lungs.

Collection of bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF)
After intratracheal instillation, euthanize the animals by CO2 asphyxia at an appropriate
time post-administration. The trachea was surgically exposed and intubated with a 20 G
catheter. The mouse lungs lavage was performed three times with 0.8 ml of prewarm
PBS to collect BALF. The collected BALF was centrifuged at 500 g for 10 min at 4°C.
The supernatants were supplemented with protease and phosphatase inhibitor cocktail
and used for downstream experiments.

Immunoprecipitation of hsACE2 from BALF
Immunoprecipitation of hsACE2 from BALF was conducted using DynabeadsTM Protein
G Immunoprecipitation kit (Thermo Fisher Scientific) according to the manufacturer’s
instruction. The collected BALF was incubated with Dynabeads having anti-V5 tag
antibody for 20 min at room temperature with rotation. Following three washes with
PBS, samples were eluted using elution buffer and denatured using LDS sample buffer
and reducing agent for western blot.

Generation of 293T-hACE2
In order to create 293T/17 cells overexpressing hACE2, we transduced the hACE2
gene to 293T/17 cells using a lentiviral vector. To produce the lentivirus packaging
hACE2 gene, 293T/17 cells were transfected with pCMVΔR8.2, pMD2.G, and pHAGE2EF1aInt-ACE2-WT using lipofectamine 2000. After 4 h, the cells were replenished with
the fresh growth media. After 48 h, the lentiviral particles were collected, filtered, and
used immediately to transduce 293T/17 cells. After 48 h transduction, the cells were
harvested, passaged with the growth media, and referred as 293T-hACE2. To confirm
the expression of hACE2 after transduction, 293T-hACE2 cells were harvested and
lysed using RIPA buffer containing protease and phosphatase inhibitor cocktail. Cell
lysates was processed to perform western blot analysis as described above. To probe
hACE2, anti-ACE2 antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, sc-390851) and anti-mouse
HRP were used as the primary and secondary antibodies at 1:200 and 1:2,000,
respectively.

Production of pseudovirus particles
293T/17 cells were seeded in T-75 flask at 5×104 cells/flask and grown for 18 h. Cells
were co-transfected with 7.8 µg of the lentiviral reporter, 1.7 µg of each helper plasmids,
and either 7.8 µg of pcDNA3.1-SARS2-Spike (Spike), 2.5 µg of pMD2.G (VSV-G), or no
plasmid (No envelope) using lipofectamine 3000 as instructed by manufacture. After 48

h, pseudoviruses were collected, filtered, aliquoted into single-use vials, and stored at 80°C.

Titration of pseudovirus particles
293T-hACE2 cells were seeded at 104 cells/well in white, 96-well plates and grown for
18 h. Cells were transduced in triplicate with a 4-point, 1:3 serial dilution of the
pseudoviruses with polybrene at a final concentration of 5 µg/ml. Polybrene was not
included in the VSV-G pseudovirus-treated wells. After 48 h, cell viability and luciferase
activity were assessed with the ONE-GloTM+Tox luciferase reporter and cell viability
assay kit.

Preparation of conditioned media for pseudovirus neutralization assay
To make conditioned media containing hsACE2, 293T/17 cells were seeded into T-75
flasks at 5×104 cells/flask and grown 18 h. Cells were transfected with 22 µg mRNA or
equivalent volume of PBS using lipofectamine 3000. After incubation for 6 h, cells were
washed with PBS and the complete media was added. After 24 h, media was
harvested, filtered with 0.45 um filter, and concentrated in a spin column with Amicon®
Ultra centrifugal filter units with 10,000 Da molecular-weight-cut-off at 4,000 g for 30
minutes. The concentrated, conditioned media was brought up to 2 ml with serum-free
media and used immediately in the neutralization assay.

FIGURE LEGENDS
Fig. 1. Design of mRNA-based nanotherapeutic to treat SARS-CoV-2 infection. (a)
Rationale for soluble ACE2 mRNA therapeutic in treating SARS-CoV-2 infection. LNPdelivered synthetic mRNA generates human soluble ACE2 (hsACE2) protein that is
secreted into the extracellular compartment where it binds receptor binding domain of
the spike protein of the SARS-CoV-2 and prevents viral entry. (b) Potential routes of
administration for soluble ACE2 mRNA therapeutic. Intravenous administration of the
LNPs encapsulating hsACE2 mRNA leads to the production of circulating hsACE2
protein from the liver. Inhalation of the LNPs leads to production of mucosal hsACE2
protein in the lungs. (c) Schematic of in-vitro-transcribed (IVT) mRNA encoding hsACE2
variant protein (red), TEV site (blue), and V5 tag (purple) (top). Endogenous hACE2
consists of three domains: extracellular, transmembrane, and cytoplasmic domains
(bottom left). The hsACE2 variant lacks transmembrane and cytoplasmic domains of the
endogenous hACE2 protein, and it contains TEV site and V5-epitope tag at C-terminus
(bottom right). (d) Schematic representation of LNP encapsulating mRNA. Inset, molar
