Abstract

20

A novel and highly pathogenic coronavirus (2019-nCoV) has caused an outbreak in Wuhan

21

city, Hubei province of China since December 2019, and soon spread nationwide and spilled

22

over to other countries around the world. To better understand the initial step of infection at

23

atomic-level, we determined the crystal structure of the 2019-nCoV spike receptor-binding

24

domain (RBD) bound with the cell receptor ACE2 at 2.45 Å resolution. The overall ACE2-

25

binding mode of the 2019-nCoV RBD is nearly identical to that of the SARS-CoV RBD, which

26

also utilizes ACE2 as the cell receptor. Structural analysis identified residues in 2019-nCoV

27

RBD critical for ACE2 binding, and majority of which are either highly conserved or shared

28

similar side chain properties with those in the SARS-CoV RBD. Such similarity in structure

29

and sequence strongly argue for a convergent evolution between 2019-nCoV and SARS-CoV

30

RBD for improved binding to ACE2 despite of being segregated in different genetic lineages

31

in the betacoronavirus genus. The epitopes of two SARS-CoV antibodies targeting the RBD

32

are also analyzed with the 2019-nCoV RBD, providing insights into future identification of

33

cross-reactive antibodies.

34

The emergence of a novel and highly pathogenic coronavirus (2019-nCoV) in Wuhan city,

35

Hubei province of China and its rapid international spread has posed a serious global public

36

health emergency1-3. Similar to those infected by pathogenic severe acute respiratory syndrome

37

coronavirus (SARS-CoV) in 2003 and Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-

38

CoV) in 2012, patients infected by 2019-nCoV manifested a range of symptoms including dry

39

cough, fever, headache, dyspnea and pneumonia with estimated mortality rate of 2.5%4-6. Since

40

the initial outbreak in December of 2019, 2019-nCoV has spread throughout China and to more

41

than twenty other countries worldwide. As of February 17, 2020, 70641 cases in China have

42

been confirmed with the infection while 7264 cases are suspected, and 1772 cases have died.

43

Currently, the epicenter Wuhan and the neighboring cities have been under lockdown to

44

minimize continued spread, and the WHO has announced a Public Health Emergency of

45

International Concern (PHEIC) duo to the rapid and global dissemination of 2019-nCoV.

46

Phylogenetic analysis on the coronavirus genomes has revealed that 2019-nCoV is a

47

new member of the betacoronavirus genus, which includes SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV, bat

48

SARS-related coronaviruses (SARSr-CoV), as well as others identified in humans and diverse

49

animal species1-3,7. Bat coronavirus RaTG13 appears to be the closest relative of the 2019-

50

nCoV sharing over 93.1% homology in the spike (S) gene. SARS-CoV and other SARSr-CoVs

51

however are rather distinct with less than 80% homology1.

52

Coronaviruses utilize the homotrimeric spike glycoprotein (S1 subunit and S2 subunit

53

in each spike monomer) on the envelope to bind their cellular receptors. Such binding triggers

54

a cascade events leading to the fusion between cell and viral membranes for cell entry. Our

55

cryo-EM studies have shown that the binding of SARS-CoV spike to the cell receptor ACE2

56

induces the dissociation of the S1 with ACE2, prompting the S2 to transition from a metastable

57

prefusion to a more stable postfusion state that is essential for membrane fusion8,9. Therefore,

58

binding to ACE2 receptor is a critical initial step for SARS-CoV to entry into the target cells.

59

Recent studies also pointed to the important role of ACE2 in mediating entry of 2019-nCoV1,10.

60

HeLa cells expressing ACE2 is susceptible to 2019-nCoV infection while those without failed

61

to do so1. In vitro SPR experiments also showed that the binding affinity of ACE2 to the spike

62

glycoprotein and to the receptor-binding domain (RBD) are equivalent, with the former of 14.7

63

nM and the latter of 15.2 nM11,12. These results indicate that the RBD is the key functional

64

component within the S1 subunit responsible for binding to ACE2.

65

The cryo-EM structure of the 2019-nCoV spike trimer at 3.5 Å resolution has just been

66

reported12. The coordinates are not yet available for detailed characterization. However,

67

inspection of the structure features presented in the uploaded manuscript on bioRxiv indicated

68

incomplete resolution of RBD in the model, particularly for the receptor-binding motif (RBM)

69

that interacts directly with ACE2. Computer modeling of interaction between 2019-CoV RBD

70

and ACE2 has identified some residues potentially involved in the actual interaction but the

71

actual interaction remained elusive13. Furthermore, despite of impressive cross-reactive

72

neutralizing activity from serum/plasma of SARS-CoV recovered patients14, no SARS-CoV

73

monoclonal antibodies targeted to RBD so far isolated are able to bind and neutralize 2019-

74

nCoV11,12. These findings highlight some intrinsic sequence and structure differences between

75

the SARS-CoV and 2019-nCoV RBDs.

76

To elucidate the 2019-nCoV RBD and ACE2 interaction at a higher resolution, we

77

chose to determine the complex structure of 2019-nCoV RBD bound with ACE2 by X-ray

78

crystallography. The atomic-level structural information would greatly improve our

79

understanding of interaction between 2019-nCoV and susceptible cells, providing precise

80

target for neutralizing antibodies, and assisting structure-based vaccine design urgently needed

81

in our ongoing combat against 2019-nCoV. Specifically, we expressed the 2019-nCoV RBD

82

(residues Arg319-Phe541) (Fig. 1a and 1b) and the N-terminal peptidase domain of ACE2

83

(residues Ser19-Asp615) in Hi5 insect cells and purified them by Ni-NTA affinity and gel-

84

filtration (Fig. S1). The complex structure was determined by molecular replacement using the

85

SARS-CoV RBD and ACE2 structures as search models, and refined at 2.45 Å resolution to

86

final Rwork and Rfree factors of 21.9% and 27.8%, respectively (Fig. S2 and Table S1). The final

87

model contains residues Cys336 to Glu516 of 2019-nCoV RBD and residues Ser19 to Asp615

88

of ACE2 N-terminal peptidase domain, as well as 63 solvent molecules.

89

The 2019-nCoV RBD has a twisted four-stranded antiparallel β sheet (β1, β2, β3 and

90

β6) with short connecting helices and loops forming as the core (Fig. 1b and 1c). Between the

91

β3 and β6 strands in the core, there is an extended insertion containing short β4 and β5 strands,

92

α4 and α5 helices and loops (Fig. 1b and 1c). This extended insertion is the receptor-binding

93

motif (RBM) containing most of the contacting residues of 2019-nCoV for ACE2 binding. A

94

total of nine cysteine residues are found in the RBD, six of which forming three pairs of

95

disulfide bonds are resolved in the final model. Among these three pairs, two are in the core

96

(Cys336-Cys361 and Cys379-Cys432) to help stabilize the β sheet structure (Fig. 1c) while the

97

remaining one (Cys480-Cys488) connects loops in the distal end of the RBM (Fig. 1c). The N-

98

terminal peptidase domain of ACE2 has two lobes, forming the peptide substrate binding site

99

between them. The extended RBM in the 2019-nCoV RBD contacts the bottom side of the

100

ACE2 small lobe, with a concave outer surface in the RBM accommodating the N-terminal

101

helix of the ACE2 (Fig. 1c). The overall structure of the 2019-nCoV RBD is similar to that of

102

the SARS-CoV RBD (Fig. 2a), with an r.m.s.d. of 1.2 Å for 174 aligned Cα atoms. Even in the

103

RBM that has more sequence variations, the overall structure is also highly similar (r.m.s.d. of

104

1.3 Å) with only one obvious conformational change in the distal end (Fig. 2a). The overall

105

binding model of the 2019-nCoV RBD to the ACE2 is also nearly identical to that observed in

106

previously determined SARS-CoV RBD/ACE2 complex structure15 (Fig. 2b).

107

The cradling of the ACE2 N-terminal helix by the RBM outer surface results in a large

108

buried surface of ~1700 Å2 between the 2019-nCoV RBD and ACE2 receptor (Fig. 1c). With

109

a distance cutoff of 4 Å, a total of 18 residues of the RBD contact 20 residues of the ACE2

110

(Fig. 3a and Table S2). Analysis of interface between SARS-CoV RBD and ACE2 revealed a

111

total of 16 residues of the SARS-CoV RBD contact 20 residues of the ACE2 (Fig. 3a and Table

112

S2). Among the 20 residues interacting with the two different RBDs, 17 are shared and most

113

of which are located at the N-terminal helix (Fig. 2a). One prominent and common feature

114

presented at both interfaces is the networks of hydrophilic interactions. There are 17 hydrogen

115

bonds and 1 salt bridge at the 2019-nCoV RBD/ACE2 interface, and 12 hydrogen bonds and 2

116

salt bridges at the SARS-CoV RBD/ACE2 interface (Table 1). Another shared feature is the

117

involvement of multiple tyrosine residues in forming hydrogen-bonding interactions with the

118

polar hydroxyl group. These include Tyr449, Tyr489, Tyr495 and Tyr505 from the 2019-nCoV

119

RBD and Tyr436, Tyr475 and Tyr491 from the SARS-CoV RBD (Table 1). To further identify

120

and compare the ACE2-interacting residues, we used structure-guided sequence alignment and

121

mapped them onto their respective RBD sequences (Fig. 3b). Among 14 shared amino acid

122

positions utilized by both RBMs for ACE2 interaction, eight have the identical residues

123

between the 2019-nCoV and SARS-CoV RBDs including Tyr449/Tyr436, Tyr453/Tyr440,

124

Asn487/Asn473, Tyr489/Tyr475, Gly496/Gly482, Thr500/Thr486, Gly502/Gly488 and

125

Tyr505/Tyr491 (Fig. 3b). Five positions have residues demonstrating similar biochemical

126

properties despite of having different side chains including Leu455/Tyr442, Phe456/Leu443,

127

486Phe/Leu472, Gln493/Asn479 and Asn501/Thr487 (Fig. 3b). Four of the five SARS-CoV

128

residues such as Tyr442, Leu472, Asn479 and Thr487 have previously been shown to be

129

critical for ACE2 binding13. The remaining one is at the Gln498/484Tyr position, while the

130

SARS-CoV RBD Tyr484 is not involved in hydrogen-bonding interaction, the Gln498 of the

131

2019-nCoV RBD forms hydrogen-bonding interaction with Gln42 of ACE2 (Table 1). Outside

132

RBM, there is a unique ACE2-interacting residues Lys417 in the 2019-nCoV, forming a salt-

133

bridge with ACE2 Asp30 (Fig. 3b). This position is replaced by a valine in the SARS-CoV

134

RBD that fails to participate in ACE2 binding (Fig. 3b). Consistently, comparison of the

135

surface electrostatic potential also identified a positive-charged patch on the 2019-nCoV RBD

136

contributed by Lys417 that is absent on the SARS-CoV RBD (Fig. 3c). Taken together, these

137

results show that the 2019-nCoV RBD/ACE2 and SARS-CoV RBD/ACE2 interfaces share

138

substantial similarity in the buried surface area, the number of interacting residues, and

139

hydrophilic interaction networks although some differences in surface electrostatic potential

140

were identified (Fig. 3). Such similarity argues strongly for the convergent evolution of the

141

2019-nCoV and SARS-CoV RBD structures to improve binding affinity to the same ACE2

142

receptor despite of being in different genetic lineages in the betacoronavirus genus.

143

Consistent with structural similarity, the binding affinities between ACE2 and 2019-

144

nCoV and SARS-CoV RBDs also fall into the same range (~10-60 nM) as previously

145

reported11,12. However, this is somewhat different from a recent report where an ~10-20 fold

146

increased binding between ACE2 and 2019-nCoV spike trimer was found (KD of 14.7 nM)

147

compared with that between ACE2 and SARS-CoV RBD-SD1 (KD of 325 nM)12. This is

148

perhaps due to the different proteins used in the assay or some other unknown reasons.

149

Nevertheless, the binding affinity alone is unlikely to explain the unusual transmissibility of

150

2019-nCoV. Other factors such as the unique “RRAR” furin cleavage site at the S1/S2

151

boundary of the 2019-nCoV spike may play more important roles in facilitating the rapid

152

human-to-human transmission.

153

Neutralizing antibodies represent a critical component of immune system in fighting

154

against viral infection. It has been reported that the 2019-nCoV could be cross-neutralized by

155

horse anti-SARS-CoV serum and convalescent serum from SARS-infected patient1,14,

156

reinforcing structural similarity between 2019-nCoV and SARS-CoV RBDs. Such similarity

157

also raised the hope of rapid application of previously characterized SARS-CoV monoclonal

158

antibodies in the clinical setting. However, no antibody targeted to SARS-CoV (m396, S230,

159

80R and CR3014) has so far demonstrated any impressive cross-binding and neutralization

160

activity against 2019-nCoV spike or RBD11,12,16-19. One exception is SARS-CoV antibody

161

CR3022 that binds to the 2019-nCoV RBD with a KD of 6.2 nM, although its neutralizing

162

activity against 2019-nCoV has not been reported yet11. Currently, we are uncertain where

163

exactly the epitope of CR3022 on SARS-CoV nor on 2019-nCoV RBDs. Among the three

164

antibodies incapable of binding to the 2019-nCoV RBD, two (m396 and 80R) have the epitopes

165

resolved by high resolution crystal structure determination of SARS-CoV RBD-Fab complexes.

166

Through mapping these epitope residues onto the sequence of SARS-CoV RBD aligned with

167

the sequence of 2019-nCoV RBD (Fig. 4), we found that antibody m396 has seven residue

168

changes in the 2019-nCoV RBD among 21 epitope positions (Fig. 4). There are 15 reside

169

changes in the 2019-nCoV RBD among 24 epitope positions by antibody 80R (Fig. 4). This

170

may provide the structural basis for the lack of cross-reactivity by m396 and 80R. However,

171

conserved residues between 2019-nCoV and SARS-nCoV RBD indeed exist, even in the more

172

variable RBM (Fig. 4). The cross-neutralization of 2019-nCoV by horse anti-SARS-CoV

173

serum and serum/plasm from recovered SARS patients indicates a great potential in identifying

174

antibodies with cross-reactivity between these two coronaviruses1,14. Such antibody will

175

present a great promise for developing therapeutic agents toward diverse coronavirus species

176

including 2019-nCoV.

Materials and Methods

179

Protein expression and purification

180

The 2019-nCoV receptor-binding domain (RBD) and the N-terminal peptidase domain of

181

human ACE2 were expressed using the Bac-to-Bac baculovirus system (Invitrogen). The 2019-

182

nCoV RBD (residues Arg319-Phe541) with an N-terminal gp67 signal peptide for secretion

183

and a C-terminal 6×His tag for purification was inserted into pFastBac-Dual vector (Invitrogen).

184

The construct was transformed into bacterial DH10Bac component cells, and the extracted

185

bacmid was then transfected into Sf9 cells using Cellfectin II Reagent (Invitrogen). The low-

186

titer viruses were harvested and then amplified to generate high-titer virus stock, which was

187

used to infect Hi5 cells at a density of 2×106 cells/ml. The supernatant of cell culture containing

188

the secreted RBD was harvested 60 h after infection, concentrated and buffer-exchanged to

189

HBS (10 mM HEPES, pH 7.2, 150 mM NaCl). RBD was captured by Ni-NTA resin (GE

190

Healthcare) and eluted with 500 mM imidazole in HBS buffer. RBD was then purified by gel

191

filtration chromatography using the Superdex 200 column (GE Healthcare) pre-equilibrated

192

with HBS buffer. Fractions containing RBD were collected.

193

The N-terminal peptidase domain of human ACE2 (residues Ser19-Asp615) was

194

expressed and purified by essentially the same protocol used for the 2019-nCoV RBD. To

195

purify the 2019-nCoV RBD/ACE2 complex, ACE2 was incubated with RBD for 1 h on ice in

196

HBS buffer, and the mixture was then subjected to gel filtration chromatography. Fractions

197

containing the complex were pooled and concentrated to 13 mg/ml.

198

Crystallization and data collection

199

Crystals were successfully grown at room temperature in sitting drops, over wells containing

200

100 mM MES, pH 6.5, 10% PEG5000mme, 12% 1-propanol. The drops were made by mixing

201

200 nL RBD/ACE2 in 20 mM Tris pH 7.5, 150 mM NaCl with 200 nL well solution. Crystals

202

were harvested, soaked briefly in 100 mM MES, pH 6.5, 10% PEG5000mme, 12% 1-propanol,

203

20% glycerol, and flash-frozen in liquid nitrogen. Diffraction data were collected at the BL17U

204

beam line of the Shanghai Synchrotron Research Facility (SSRF)20. Diffraction data were auto-

205

processed with aquarium pipeline and the data processing statistics are listed in Table S121.

206

Structural determination and refinement

207

The structure was determined by the molecular replacement method with PHASER in CCP4

208

suite22. The search models are ACE2 extracellular domain and SARS-CoV RBD (PDB code

209

2AJF). Density map improvement by atoms update and refinement was performed with

210

ARP/wARP23. Subsequent model building and refinement were performed using COOT and
