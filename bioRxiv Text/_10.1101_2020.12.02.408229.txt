Abstract
Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2), the etiologic agent of
Coronavirus Disease- 2019 (COVID-19), is rapidly accumulating new mutations. Analysis of these
mutations is necessary for gaining knowledge regarding different aspects of therapeutic
development. Recently, we have reported a Sanger method based genome sequence of a viral
isolate named SARS-CoV-2 NIB-1, circulating in Bangladesh. The genome has four novel
mutations in V121D, V843F, A889V and G1691C positions. V121D substitution has the potential
to destabilize the Non-Structural Protein (NSP-1) which inactivates the type-1 Interferon-induced
antiviral system hence this mutant could be the basis of attenuated vaccines against SARS-CoV2. V843F, A889V and G1691C are all located in NSP3. G1691C can decrease the flexibility of the
protein while V843F and A889V changed the binding pattern of SARS-CoV-2 Papain-Like
protease (PLPro) inhibitor GRL0617. V843F PLPro showed reduced affinity for Interferon
Stimulating Gene-15 (ISG-15) protein whereas

V843F+A889V double mutants exhibited the

same binding affinity as wild type PLPro. Here, V843F is a conserved position of PLPro that
damaged the structure but A889V, a less conserved residue, most probably neutralized that
damage. Mutants of NSP1 could provide attenuated vaccines against coronavirus. Also, these
mutations of PLPro could be targeted to develop anti-SARS therapeutics.

Introduction
Coronavirus Disease- 2019 (COVID-19) is now an irrepressible pandemic that

continuously threatening humanity since its causative agent Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome
Coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) is rapidly changing and adapting in different environments [1]. At
the beginning of the COVID-19 outbreak, this viral infection caused flu-like symptoms such as
cough, fever, and trouble breathing [2]. However, this acellular pathogen is constantly evolving
with novel mutations thus viral diarrhea, cardiovascular injury, strokes, psychosis, dementia and
Kawasaki like syndrome are becoming more frequent in COVID-19 cases [3-5]. According to the
World Health Organization (WHO), this constant evolution in different selection pressures are
letting the virus to be airborne [6]. Proper analysis of these genomic mutations can help to decipher
issues regarding viral transmission, epidemiology, pathogenicity and therapeutics.
Coronaviruses (CoVs) are enveloped viruses that belong to the Coronaviridae family and
Orthocoronavirinae subfamily [7, 8]. SARS-CoV-1 and Middle East Respiratory Syndrome
(MERS-CoV) belong to the Betacoronavirus genus of Orthocoronavirinae subfamily [7, 8]. These
pathogens were the causative agents of SARS and MERS epidemics. SARS-CoV-2, a member of
Betacoronavirus, shares nearly 82.30% sequence similarity with SARS-CoV-1 while showing
strikingly less similarity with MERS (28%) [9].
SARS-CoV-2 has a 29.9 kb single-stranded (+) positive RNA genome with 11 genes. The virus
also contains two Untranslated Regions (UTRs) in 5' and 3' terminal. Nearly 67% of the genome
consist of Orf1ab polyprotein gene. The rest of the genome constructs structural proteins e.g.,
Surface (S), Envelope (E), Membrane (M), and Nucleocapsid (N) proteins [10]. According to the

recent update of Global initiative on sharing all influenza data (GISAID) database, with particular
prevalent mutations, the virus has made six distinct clades such as S, L, V, G, GR and GH [11].
Among them, GR is the largest and predominates in South America, Europe and Asia (gsaid.org).
The members of this clade contain S-D614G and N-G204R mutations. Currently, GR is relatively
less prevalent in North America. However, recently we have sequenced a GR type viral isolate
SARS-CoV-2/human/BGD/NIB_01/2020 (SARS-CoV-2 NIB-1) (NCBI GenBank Accession:
MT509958, GISAID Accession ID: EPI_ISL_447904) from a young female COVID-19 patient of
Bangladesh [12]. According to our report, the viral isolate shares a common ancestor with three
North American SARS-CoV-2 isolates that were collected from Washington, United States of
America (USA). Additionally, our isolate showed longer branch length or more genomic mutations
than its closely related members [12]. When we aligned the genome with the reference genome
(Accession: NC_045512.2), we found 11 mutations of which 4 of them were new. Among them,
three were found in Papain-Like Protease (PLPro) and C-terminal domain of Non-structural
Protein (NSP)-3 and another one was located in NSP1 (Table: I).
Several studies have demonstrated that NSP1 and the PLPro of NSP3 from SARS-Cov-1
and 2 play a critical role to inhibit the type 1 interferon (IFN) response in the host cell [13].
Moreover, PLPro cleaves off Interferon Stimulating Gene-15 (ISG15) protein, therefore, the host
cell cannot execute antiviral signals properly [14, 15].
In this study, we have analyzed the effect of these novel mutations on the respective protein
structures. We have shown that some of these mutations have the potential to destabilize the
structure of NSP1 and the C-terminal domain of NSP3. We also explored how the loss and gain of
Valine in V843F and A889V mutations respectively affect the binding of protease inhibitor
GRL0617 and ISG15 for their implication in new therapeutics development.

Methods:
2.1. Genome retrieval and identification of the mutations:
The genome of SARS-CoV-2 NIB-1 was collected from the National Center for Biotechnology
Information (NCBI) (GenBank accession: MT509958.1). The genome was aligned with the
reference genome by NCBI Nucleotide Basic Local Alignment Search Tools (BLASTN) to
identify the mutations in the Untranslated Regions (UTRs) [16]. The Non-synonymous mutations
were collected from GISAID CoVsurver (gisaid.org).
2.2.

Effect of the mutations on the proteins:

Mutations that affect the structural stability of the proteins can behave differently than the wild
type

one

[17,

18].

To

assess

the

effect

of

the

novel

mutations,

MUpro,

Protein Variation Effect Analyzer (PROVEAN) and HOPE were employed [19-21]. Afterward,
PLPro was taken for further analysis due to the availability of structural and molecular mechanisms
on this protein.
2.3.

In silico mutagenesis, molecular modeling and refinement of PLPro:

To observe the mutational effect of the protein at three dimensional (3D) level, the crystal structure
of PLPro was collected from Research Collaboratory for Structural Bioinformatics (RCSB) Protein
Data Bank (PDB) (www.rcbs.org) [22]. The chain A of PLPro (PDB ID: 6W9C) was preserved
via BIOVIA Discovery Studio (https://www.3ds.com/). Heterogeneous atoms were also removed.
Mutated protein sequences went under homology modeling by SWISS-MODEL using chain A of
6W9C as a template [23]. The generated structures were energetically minimized by 3D Refine
and then again refined by Galaxy Refine [24, 25].

2.4.

Structural assessment of mutant proteins:

The structural quality of the mutant proteins was evaluated. To execute this step, RAMPAGE and
SWISS-MODEL structure assessment were employed [23, 26].
2.5.

Inhibitor binding analysis against the wild type and mutant PLPros

GRL0617 or 5-Amino-2-methyl-N-[(R)-1-(1-naphthyl) ethyl] benzamide (PubChem CID:
24941262) is a PLPro inhibitor with a relatively low level of cytotoxicity [27]. Hence, this
naphthalene based small molecule has the potential to be a prospective antiviral drug. Here, we
analyzed the interactions between GRL0617 and PLPro by AutoDock Vina using our previously
reported methodology for exploring drug-receptor interactions [28, 29]. In short, the GRL0616
was taken as ligand and the wild type and mutant proteins were used as receptors. The active site
of the palm domain in PLPro was enclosed with Grid Box [30]. (Parameters are given in
Supplementary file:1). The molecular interactions between GRL0617-PLPro were visualized by
UCSF Chimera [31], BIOVIA Discovery Studio and PyMOL Molecular Graphics System, Version
2.3.3 Schrödinger, LLC.
2.6.

Analysis of ISG15-PLPro interactions:

ISG15 C-terminal domain that interacts with PLPro was collected from PDB ID: 6XA9. As a
ligand/ substrate, this protein was docked against the PLPro receptors by GalaxyTongDock_A
[32]. Model 1 with the highest cluster size and docking score was further analyzed by PRODIGY
(PROtein binDIng enerGY prediction) to determine the binding affinity of the protein complexes
at 25o C temperature [33].

Results:

The overall scheme of the present study has been described in Figure 1
3.1.

Transversion mutations are predominant in SARS-CoV-2 NIB-1:

SARS-CoV-2 NIB-1 is a member of the GR clade (Table 1). The genome contains 11 mutations
in total. Among them, 6 were transversion mutations and 5 were transition mutations. According
to GISAID, 7 of these mutations were reported previously and 4 of them were first identified in
SARS-CoV-2 NIB-1 isolate. In these 7 mutations, 4 were transition mutations; Three Purine
→Purine transitions (Table 1; Serial # 4-6) and one Pyrimidine →Pyrimidine transition (Table 1;
Serial # 1). The other three mutations were transversion mutations: Two Purine → Pyrimidine
transversions (Table 1; Serial # 2, 3) and one Pyrimidine →Purine transversion (Table 1; Serial #
7). The 4 novel mutations were located in the Orf1b gene. Among them, only A889V substitution
occurred due to C → T (Pyrimidine → Pyrimidine) transition. The other 3 mutations were
transversion substitutions; Two Purine → Pyrimidine transversions (Table 1; Serial # 9, 11), one
Pyrimidine →Purine transversion.
3.2.

Novel mutations have the potential to alter the functions and structures of protein:

According to the MUPro, V121D, V843F and G1691C destabilize the proteins (Table 2).
Moreover, PROVEAN determined that the V121D and G1691C substitutions are deleterious for
its biological functions. HOPE demonstrated that most of the mutant amino acids are located in a
conserved region and they are bigger than the wild type residues. They have the potential to abolish
the protein functions. In contrast, only A889V mutant PLPro can increase protein stability (Table
2).

3.3.

Interaction patterns of GRL0617-PLPro altered in mutant proteases

The interactions between the inhibitor GRL0617 and PLPro were identified via molecular docking
simulation. Before molecular docking, the quality of the receptors was evaluated by analyzing
Ramachandran plots and MolProbity scores. Ramachandran plots showed that the mutant PLPros
have 98.1-98.4% amino acids in favored regions (~98% expected). The MolProbity score of the
wild type crystal structure was 2.55 whereas the mutants have MolProbity scores between 1.161.32 (Supplementary file 3). Therefore, after the homology modeling, the quality of the simulated
structures were satisfactory for further analysis [26, 34].
V843F PLPro (-6.7 kcal/mol) and A889V PLPro (-6.9 kcal/mol) showed more binding affinity
scores than the wild type one (-6.6 kcal/mol) (Table 3). However, V843F+ A889V PLPro showed
slightly less affinity (-6.2 kcal/mol).
Although the binding affinity did not change significantly due to the mutations, the inhibitor
binding site changed and hence the interacting amino acids (Table 3). The wild type receptor
interacted with ASP164, ARG166, GLU167, SER170, PRO248, TYR264 whereas ASP76,
ARG82 were common interacting residues for mutant type receptors. Moreover, residues that
participated in hydrogen bonding in Wild type single mutants and double mutants were not the
same. V843F and A889V single mutants have the same residue CYS155 which interacted with
the inhibitor through Hydrogen bonding.

3.4.

V843F mutation significantly reduced the affinity of PLPro toward ISG15

SARS-CoV-2 PLPros cleaves off ISG15 that is essential for type 1 IFN mediated antiviral
mechanisms [14]. The wild type, A889V and V843F+ A889V mutants showed nearly the same
binding affinity (-15.4 to -15.5 kcal/mol) toward the C terminal domain of ISG15. However,

V843F mutant exhibited a significantly lower docking score and binding affinity (-11.1 kcal/mol)
with higher dissociation constant (Table 3).

Discussions:

SARS-CoV-2 is a zoonotic pathogen that initiated the current global pandemic COVID-19 [2].
Since SARS-CoV-2 is a novel coronavirus and mostly resemble with SARS-CoV-1 (80%
sequence similarity), we therefore focused on SARS-CoV-1 related reports to understand the
results of the mutations [35]. However, we also explored other well studied betacoronavirus
members such as Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS-CoV), Human Coronavirus OC43,
Mouse Hepatitis Coronavirus (MHV) to comprehend different genomic and proteomic functions
of SARS-CoV-2.
Since the report of reference genome SARS-CoV-2 from Wuhan in December 2019, the deadly
pathogen has spread throughout the world and produced numerous genetic variants with six
predominant clades (www.gisaid.org). The GISAID CoVsurver analysis revealed that our
previously reported isolate ‘SARS-CoV-2 NIB-1’ is a member of GR clade which has been
mutated 10 times in the coding regions [12]. The NCBI BLASTN unveiled another mutation in 5'
UTR region. Interestingly, among these mutations, 54% occurred due to transversion mutations
(Table 1) although species are usually biased to transition mutations [36]. Transversion mutations
are detrimental for RNA viruses e.g. Influenza A and Human Immunodeficiency Viruses (HIV)
since it can radically change the amino acids [37].
The novel mutations V121D, V843F and G1691C occurred in SARS-CoV-2 NIB-1 isolate due to
transversion substitutions have the potential to destabilize or alter the protein structure and function
(Table 2). Especially, V121D, V843F position are highly conserved in the protein and G1691C

might reduce the essential flexibility of NSP3 (Table 2). Amino acid substitution in V843F and
G1691C took place due to G → T transversion that was possibly introduced by Oxo-guanine
generated from reactive oxygen species (ROS) [37, 38]. Conversely, C → T transition, the most
frequent transition of SARS-CoV-2, increased the structural stability of PLPro (Table 2) [38].
Besides, the C → T transition in the 5' UTR region might interfere with the function of N and
NSP1 protein [39].
SARS-CoV-2 NIB-1 has V121D and L122I amino acid substitutions in the NSP1. SARS-CoV-2
NSP1 has 84.4% similarity with SARS-CoV-1 NSP1 [40]. NSP1 is a potent virulence factor of
SARS-CoV-1that reduces the host mRNA expression by binding with the host 40S ribosome to
inhibit the translation and specifically accelerate host mRNA degradation keeping the viral mRNA
intact [40, 41]. NSP1 also disrupts the activation of IFN-dependent antiviral signaling pathways
and represses the expression of the innate immune response genes such as type I IFN, ISG56 and
ISG15 [13, 42]. That IFN and ISG15 gene-mediated antiviral pathways are crucial in host defense
mechanisms against SARS-CoV-1 & 2 were shown by the suppression of their multiplication
through in vitro type-1 IFN treatment [43, 44]. An attenuated mutant of NSP1 in SARS-CoV-1
can replicate as efficiently as wild-type strains with an intact IFN response [45]. Moreover, mutant
NSP1 of MHV exhibited an adequate amount of cytotoxic T cells that protected the mice against
further viral infections [46]. Hence, there is a higher possibility that a suitable NSP1 mutant of
SARS-CoV-2 would work as an attenuated vaccine for COVID-19. Through computational
analysis, we have observed that V121D and L122I mutant might destabilize the structure of NSP1
(Table 2 & Supplementary: 2) yet with these two mutations, the virus caused mild fever, cough
and throat congestion in a young female patient [12]. Therefore, V121D and L122I mutations
along with 93th C → T in 5' UTR did not change the pathogenicity of SARS-CoV-2 significantly.

However, keeping in mind that the quick recovery of the patient within 10 days of the onset of
symptoms without any notable care, it might be speculated that NSP1 with these mutations could
be a potent candidate for the development of an attenuated vaccine against SARS-CoV-2.
Main protease and papain-like protease (PLPro) are two essential viral enzymes that are vital for
polypeptide processing during viral maturation [40]. Therefore, inhibitors of these proteins could
be a prospective antiviral drug [47]. SARS-CoV-1 PLPro has been targeted to develop inhibitors
for decades [30]. SARS-CoV-1 & 2 PLPros have 4 domains (Figure 3) [27]. The active site of this
enzyme resides in the thumb domain. PLPro interacts with the N and C terminal domain of ISG15
through Ubiquitin binding subsites 2 and 1 respectively [30]. This interaction finally cleaves off
ISG15. Hence, type 1 IFN induced ISG15 antiviral response cannot function properly in host cells
[14]. A recent study also demonstrated that when SARS-CoV-1 & 2 infected Vero and Calu3 2B4
cell lines are treated with type 1 INF, the SARS-CoV-2 showed more susceptibility to the treatment
[43, 44]. Most possibly the IFN treatment enhanced the synthesis of ISG15 that ceased the viral
replications in the cell lines. PLPro mediated pathogenesis can be halted with naphthalene based
protease inhibitor GRL0617 since this ligand can make non-covalent bonds with SARS-CoV-2
PLPro [14, 27]. Here, V843F and A889V mutations were located in the PLPro domain of NSP3
protein. V843F, A889V single mutants and V843F+A889V double mutants changed the binding
site of GRL0617. The inhibitor binds in the thumb domain of the wild type receptor whereas the
mutant receptors interacted through the Ubiquitin-Like Domain (Figure 2). Whether these
alterations in binding patterns reduce the efficacy of the ligand or not is yet to be explored.
The mutant PLPros were also docked against the C-terminal domain of ISG-15. To execute this
step, the ISG15 portion was separated from the PLPro-ISG15 C-terminal domain complex (PDB
ID: 6XA9). Only the V843F single mutant showed reduced affinity toward the Ubiquitin binding

subsite 1. Mutant A889V, V843F+A889V and Wild type PLPro did not show any difference when
docked against ISG15. Therefore, V843F is a detrimental and destabilizing transversion mutation
that might reduce the degradation of ISG15. It seems like A889V substitution protected the
protease from the damage of V843F. Since A889V occurred due to the most common C → T
transition, plausibly this mutation appeared first in the protein and then V843F took place due to
ROS. Yet, further studies are needed to explore how this “yin and yang” incident affects the viral
physiology. We hope our findings will give better insights during the development of attenuated
vaccine and antiviral drugs.

Conclusions:

This study focused on some novel mutations in the NSP1 and NSP3 proteins of SARS-CoV-2.
NSP1 is a potent virulence factor of Betacoronavirus and hence a potential target for an attenuated
vaccine. PLPro of SARS-like coronavirus has appeared as suitable targets for the development of
anti-SARS therapeutics. In-depth, mutational studies on these proteins gave us better insights into
the SARS-CoV-2 viral structure and pathogenicity for their fittingness as effective therapeutics
candidates. In the future, wet lab research on the mutants will accelerate research and
developments regarding attenuated vaccines and antiviral drugs.

The mutant residue is located near a
highly conserved position. The mutant
and wild-type residue are not very
similar. Based on this conservation
information this mutation is probably
damaging to the protein.
