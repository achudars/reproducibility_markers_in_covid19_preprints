ABSTRACT

Abstract. The pandemic of SARS coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) has motivated an intensive analysis of its
molecular epidemiology following its worldwide spread. To understand the early evolutionary events
20

following its emergence, a dataset of 985 complete SARS-CoV-2 sequences was assembled. Variants
showed a mean 5.5-9.5 nucleotide differences from each other, commensurate with a mid-range
coronavirus substitution rate of 3x10-4 substitutions/site/year. Almost half of sequence changes were
C->U transitions with an 8-fold base frequency normalised directional asymmetry between C->U and
U->C substitutions. Elevated ratios were observed in other recently emerged coronaviruses (SARS-CoV

25

and MERS-CoV) and to a decreasing degree in other human coronaviruses (HCoV-NL63, -OC43, -229E
and -HKU1) proportionate to their increasing divergence. C->U transitions underpinned almost half of
the amino acid differences between SARS-CoV-2 variants, and occurred preferentially in both 5’U/A
and 3’U/A flanking sequence contexts comparable to favoured motifs of human APOBEC3 proteins.
Marked base asymmetries observed in non-pandemic human coronaviruses (U>>A>G>>C) and low

30

G+C contents may represent long term effects of prolonged C->U hypermutation in their hosts.

Importance: The evidence that much of sequence change in SARS-CoV-2 and other coronaviruses may
be driven by a host APOBEC-like editing process has profound implications for understanding their
short and long term evolution. Repeated cycles of mutation and reversion in favoured mutational
35

hotspots and the widespread occurrence of amino acid changes with no adaptive value for the virus
represents a quite different paradigm of virus sequence change from neutral and Darwinian
evolutionary frameworks that are typically used in molecular epidemiology investigations.

INTRODUCTION

SARS-coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) emerged late 2019 in the Hubei province, China as a cause of
respiratory disease occasionally leading to acute respiratory distress syndrome and death (COVID45

19)(1-4). Since the first reports in December, 2019, infections with SARS-CoV-2 have been reported
from a rapidly increasing number of countries worldwide, and led to its declaration as a pandemic by
the World Health Organisation in March, 2020. In order to understand the origins and transmission
dynamics of SARS-CoV-2, sequencing of SARS-CoV-2 directly from samples of infected individuals
worldwide has been performed on an unprecedented scale. These efforts have generated many

50

thousands of high quality consensus sequences spanning the length of the genome and have defined
a series of geographically defined clusters that recapitulate the early routes of international spread.
However, as commented elsewhere (https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.03.16.20034470), there is
remarkable little virus diversity at this early stage of the pandemic and analyses of its evolutionary
dynamics remain at an early stage.

55
The relative infrequency of substitutions is the consequence of a much lower error rate on genome
copying by the viral RNA polymerase of the larger nidovirales, including coronaviruses. This is achieved
through the development of a proofreading capability through mismatch detection and excision by a
viral encoded exonuclease, Nsp14-ExoN (5-7). Consequently, coronaviruses show a low substitution
60

rate over time, typically in the range of 1.5 – 10 x 10-4 substitutions per site per year (SSY) (8-13).
Applying a mid-range estimate to the 3-5 month timescale of the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic indicates that
epidemiologically unrelated strains might show around 6-10 nucleotides differences from each other
over the 30,000 base length of their genomes.

65

In the current study, we have analysed the nature of the sequence diversity generated within the
SARS-CoV-2 virus populations revealed by current and ongoing virus sequencing studies. We obtained
evidence for a preponderance of driven mutational events within the short evolutionary period
following the zoonotic transmission of SARS-CoV-2 into humans. Sequence substitutions were
characterised by a preponderance of cytidine to uridine (C->U) transitions. The possibility that the

70

initial diversity within a viral population was largely host-induced would have major implications for
evolutionary reconstruction of SARS-CoV-2 variants in the current pandemic, as well as in our
understanding both of host antiviral pathways against coronaviruses and the longer term shaping
effects on their genome composition.

RESULTS

Sequence changes in SARS-CoV-2. Four separate datasets of full length, (near-) complete genome
sequences of SARS-CoV-2 sequences collected from the start of the pandemic to those most recently
80

deposited on the 24th April, 2020 were aligned and analysed. Each dataset showed minimal levels of
sequence divergence, with mean pairwise distances ranging from 5.5-9.5 nucleotide differences
between each sequence. However, several aspects of the frequencies and sequence contexts of the
observed changes were unexpected. Firstly, the ratio of non-synonymous (amino acid changing) to
synonymous substitutions was high – in the range of 0.57-0.73 amongst the different SARS-CoV-2

85

datasets. This contrasts with a much lower ratio (consistently below <0.22) in sequence datasets
assembled for the other human coronaviruses (Table 1). Including a range of coronaviruses in the
analysis, there was a consistent association between dN/dS with degree of sequence divergence (Fig.
1).

90

We next estimated frequencies of individual transitions and transversions occurring during the shortterms evolution of SARS-CoV-2. Sequence differences between each SARS-CoV-2 full genome
sequence and a majority rule consensus sequence generated for each of the four SARS-CoV-2 datasets
were calculated. The directionality of sequence change underlying the observed substitutions was
inferred through restricting analysis to polymorphic sites with a minimal number of variable bases

95

(typically singletons). In practice because of the scarcity of substitutions, variability thresholds of 10%,
5%, 2% and 1% yielded similar numbers and relative frequencies of each transition and transversion.
Equivalent evidence for directionality was obtained through comparison of each sequence in the
dataset with the first outbreak sequence (MN908947; Wuhan-Hu-1), approximately ancestral to
current circulating SARS-CoV-2 strains (data not shown). For the purposes of the analysis presented

100

here, a consensus-based 5% threshold was used.

A listing of the sequence changes revealed a striking (approximately four-fold) excess of sites where
C->U substitutions occurred in SARS-CoV-2 sequences compared to the other three transitions (Fig.
2A). This excess was the more remarkable given there was an almost two-fold greater number of U
105

bases in the SARS-CoV-2 genome compared to C’s (32.1% compared to 18.4%). To formally analyse
the excess of C->U transitions we calculated an index of asymmetry (frequency[C->U] / f[U->C]) x
(fU/fC) and compared this with degrees of sequence divergence and dN/dS ratio in SARS-CoV-2 and
other coronavirus datasets (Fig. 2B, 2C). This comparison showed that the excess of C->U substitutions

was most marked among very recently diverged sequences associated with the SARS-CoV-2 and SARS110

CoV outbreaks and was reduced significantly in sequence datasets of the more divergent human
coronaviruses (NL63, OC43, 229E and OC43) datasets as sequences accumulated substitutions.

C->U substitutions were scattered throughout the SARS-CoV-2 genome (Fig. 3). Long bars representing
more polymorphic sites were frequently shared between replicate datasets but unique substitutions
115

(occurring once in the dataset - short bars) showed largely separate distributions. Substitutions were
not focussed towards any particular gene or intergenic region although all three datasets showed
marginally higher frequencies of substitutions in the N gene. The grouping of a selection of sequences
showing C->U changes in different genome regions were plotted in a phylogenetic tree containing
sequences from the SARS-CoV-2 dataset (Fig. 4). Within the resolution possible in tree generated from

120

such a minimally divergent dataset, many sequences with shared C-U changes were not monophyletic
(eg. those with substitutions at positions 5784, 10319, 21575, 28657 and 28887). This lack of grouping
is consistent with multiple de novo occurrences of the same mutation in different SARS-CoV-2
lineages.

125

The abnormally high dN/dS ratios of 0.6-0.7 in SARS-CoV-2 sequences (Table 1; Fig. 1) indicated that
around 50% of nucleotide substitutions would produce amino acid changes (if approximately 75% of
nucleotide changes are non-synonymous). On analysis of amino acid sequence changes, a remarkable
50% of non-synonymous substitutions in the SARS-CoV-2 sequence dataset were the consequence of
C->U transitions (Fig. 5). The underlying mechanism that leads to C->U hypermutation therefore also

130

drives much of the amino acid sequence diversity observed in SARS-CoV-2.

The context of cytidines within a sequence strongly influenced the likelihood of it mutating to a U (Fig.
6). The greatest numbers of mutations were observed if the upstream (5’) base was an A or U. There
was also a similar approximately 4-fold increase in transitions if these bases were located on the
135

downstream (3’) side. The effects of the 5’ and 3’ contexts were additive; C residues surrounded by
an A or U at both 5’ and 3’ sides were 10-fold more likely to mutate than those flanked by C or G
residues (mean 31.9 transitions compared to 3.6). Splitting the data down into the 16 combinations
of 5’ and 3’ contexts, a 5’U far more potently restricted non-C->U substitutions than a 5’A (Fig. S1;
Suppl. Data), while 5’G or 5’C almost eliminated substitutions irrespective of the 3’ context. No context

140

created any substantial asymmetry in G->A compared to A->G transitions.

The G+C content of coronaviruses varied substantially between species, with highest frequencies in
the recently emerged zoonotic coronaviruses (MERS-CoV: 41%, SARS-CoV: 41% and SARS-CoV-2: 38%)
and lowest in HKU1 (32%). Collectively, there was a significant relationship between C depletion and
145

U enrichment with G+C content (Fig. 7). The difference in G+C content was indeed almost entirely
attributable to changes in the frequencies of C and U bases; the 9% difference in G+C content between
MERS-CoV and HKU1 arose primarily from the 20% -> 13% reduction in frequencies of C. There was a
comparable 8% increase in the frequency of U. Their combined effects left frequencies of G and A
relatively unchanged. It appears that the accumulated effect of the C->U / U->C asymmetry led to

150

marked compositional abnormalities in coronaviruses.

DISCUSSION
155
The wealth of sequence data generated since the outset of the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic, the accuracy
of the sequences obtained by a range of NGS technologies and the long genomes and very low
substitution rate of coronaviruses provided a unique opportunity to investigate sequence
diversification at very high resolution. The findings additionally provide insights into the mutational
160

mechanisms and contexts where sequence changes occur. Thirdly, it informs us about the longer term
evolution of viruses and potential effects of the cell in moulding virus composition.

The mechanism of SARS-CoV-2 hypermutation. The most striking finding that emerged from the
analysis of more than 1000 SARS-CoV-2 genomes was the preponderance of C->U transitions
165

compared to other substitutions in the initial 4-5 months of its evolution. These accounted for 38%42% of all changes in the four SARS-CoV-2 datasets. In seeking alternative, non-biological explanations
for this observation, they cannot have arisen through misincorporation errors in the next generation
sequence methods used to produce the dataset because the analysis in the current was restricted to
consensus sequences. These are generally assembled from libraries that typically possess reasonable

170

coverage and read depth; error frequencies of < 10-4 per site (14) would therefore improbably create
a consensus change in a sequence library. There was furthermore, no comparable increase in G->A
mutations (Fig. 2) and the sequence context in which sequencing errors occur (a 5’ or 3’ C or G; (14))
did not match the favoured context for mutation observed in our dataset (Fig. 6).

This asymmetric mutation furthermore cannot have arisen through a mutational effect of the
coronavirus RNA dependent RNA polymerase during virus replication. By definition, a coronavirus RNA
genome descends from any other through an equal number of copyings of the positive and negative
strands – any tendency to misincorporate a U instead of a C would be reflected in a parallel number
of G->A mutations where this error occurred on the minus strand (or vice versa). As demonstrated

180

however, G->A mutations occurred at a much lower frequency than C->U mutations and were similar
to those of A->G (Figs. 2A, 6).

The most cogent explanation for C->U hypermutation is the action of RNA editing processes within
the infected cell. A well characterised antiviral pathway involves the interferon-inducible isoform of
185

adenosine deaminase acting on RNA type 1 (ADAR1)(15). This edits A to inosine in regions of viral
double-stranded RNA, which is subsequently copied as a G. Irrespective of its widely demonstrated
antiviral role in a range of typically minus stranded RNA viruses, the mutations it creates do not match
those observed in SARS-CoV-2 or other coronaviruses. Firstly, ADAR1 target dsRNA so editing effects
tend to be symmetric with A->G substitutions being matched by T->C mutations. Secondly the

190

direction of mutation is wrong. The focus of the analysis in the current study was on infrequent or
unique polymorphisms where ancestral and mutant bases can be inferred. The excess of C->U
transitions is the opposite of those induced by ADAR1.

A second, interferon-inducible pathway edits retroviral DNA during transcription and is strand specific;
195

its typical antiviral activity is to mutate single stranded proviral DNA formed after first strand synthesis
from genomic RNA (16-18). The deamination of C’s to T’s leads to the observed excess of G->A changes
in the complementary positive stranded RNA virus genome (19). This editing function is performed by
members of the apolipoprotein B mRNA-editing enzyme, catalytic polypeptide-like (APOBEC) family,
many of which possess defined antiviral functions against retroviruses, hepatitis B viruses, small DNA

200

viruses and intra-cellular mobile retroelements (reviewed in (20)). The APOBEC3 gene family members
that are primarily involved in antiviral defence show evidence of extensive positive selection and
expansion over the course of mammalian evolution, particularly in the primate lineage. Humans
possess 7 active antiviral proteins (A3A, A3B, A3C, A3D, A3F, A3G and A3H) that contrasts with single
A1 gene in rodents and a range of other mammals (21, 22).

205
While deamination of cytidines in single-stranded DNA sequences is a hallmark of APOBEC function,
APOBECs show binding affinities for single stranded RNA templates that may mediate antiviral
functions. A3B and A3F has been shown to block retrotransposition of a LINE-1 transposons mRNA

through a non-deamination pathway (23), potentially through binding to single-stranded RNA. Direct
210

editing of HIV-1 RNA by the rat A1 APOBEC and the accumulation of C->U hypermutation verified that
RNA could also be used as a substrate for deamination (24). This suggested to the authors at that time
that APOBEC-mediated RNA editing was a potential antiviral activity mechanism against RNA viruses
as well as retroviruses.

215

Since then, evidence supporting this conjecture has been difficult to obtain; the virus inhibitory effect
of APOBECs against enterovirus A71, measles, mumps and respiratory syncytial viruses were not
shown to be associated with the development of virus mutations (25, 26). Similarly, A3C, A3F or A3H,
but not A3A, A3D and A3G were shown to inhibit the replication of the human coronavirus, HCoVNL63, but their expression did not lead to de novo C->U (or G->A) mutations on virus passaging (27).

220

On the other hand, It has been demonstrated that A3A and A3G possess potent RNA editing capability
on mRNA expressed in hypoxic macrophages (28), natural killer cells (29) and transfected A3Goverexpressing HEK 293T cells (30). These latter findings verify that APOBECs do possess RNA editing
capabilities but do not provide any mechanistic context for the potential inhibition of RNA virus
replication by this mechanism. Nevertheless the pronounced asymmetry in C->U transitions in SARS-

225

CoV-2 and the preferential substitution of C’s flanked by U and A bases on both 5’ and 3’ sides (Fig. 6)
that broadly matches what is known about the favoured contexts of A3A, A3F and A3H (31) provides
strong circumstantial grounds for suspecting a role of one or more APOBEC proteins in coronavirus
mutagenesis. Their exceptionally long genomes (≈30,000 bases), the exposure of genomic RNA in the
cytoplasm before initiation of replication complex formation and the potentially lethal effects of just

230

one mutations introduced into the genomic sequence makes APOBEC-mediated anti-coronaviral
activity plausible in virological terms. It is perhaps because of the otherwise low mutation rate of
coronaviruses and the extensive dataset of accurate, minimally divergent SARS-CoV-2 sequences
assembled post-pandemic that has enabled this mutational signature to be so clearly observed.

235

Evolutionary implications. The key finding in the study was the combined evidence for an APOBEClike editing process driving initial sequences changes in SARS-CoV-2 and that the observed
substitutions have not arisen through a typical pattern on random mutation and fixation that is
assumed in evolutionary models. A specific problem for evolutionary reconstructions would be the
existence of highly uneven substitution rates at different sites; APOBEC-mediated editing (and indeed

240

the pattern of C-U transition in SARS-CoV-2 sequences) is strongly dependent on sequence context
and, for at least two APOBECs, additionally influenced by their proximity to RNA secondary structure
elements in the target sequence (28, 31). Sequence changes in SARS-CoV-2 and other coronavirus

genomes may therefore be partially or largely restricted to number of mutational hotspots that may
promote convergent changes between otherwise genetically unlinked strains. As demonstrated in Fig.
245

4, these can conflict with relationships reconstructed from phylogenetically informative sites.
Furthermore, the substitution rate reconstructed for SARS-CoV-2 and potentially other coronaviruses
may represent an uncomfortable amalgam of both the accumulation of neutral changes and forced
changes induced by APOBEC-like editing processes that may obscure temporal reconstructions. A
recent

250

analysis

of

SARS-CoV-2

genomes

illustrates

these

problems

(https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.03.16.20034470); only a tiny fraction of variable sites (0.34%) were
found to phylogenetically informative, while a high frequency of unresolved quartets demonstrates
further the lack of phylogenetic signal in SARS-CoV-2 evolution reconstructions. The occurrence of
multiple of driven change under host-induced selection is consistent with these cautionary
observations.

255
The other important consequence of C->U hypermutation is that most of the amino acid sequence
diversity observed in SARS-CoV-2 strains originates directly from forced mutations and therefore
cannot be regarded in any way as adaptive for the virus (Fig. 5). An RNA editing mechanism of the type
discussed above evidently places a huge mutational load on SARS-CoV-2 that may underpin the
260

abnormally high dN/dS ratios recorded in SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV sequence datasets (Fig. 1). It is
likely that many or most amino acid changes are mildly deleterious and transient; repeated rounds of
mutation at favoured editing sites followed by reversion may therefore contribute to the large
numbers of scattered substitutions in SARS-CoV-2 sequences that conflict with their phylogeny.

265

Finally, it is intriguing to speculate on the long-term effects of the C->U/U->C asymmetry and the
extent to which this may contribute to the previously described compositional abnormalities of
coronaviruses (32, 33). As described above in connection with mutation frequencies, the
compositional asymmetries cannot directly arise through viral RdRp mutational biases because any
resulting base frequency differences would be symmetric (ie. G≈C, A≈U). Instead it appears that the

270

observed imbalances in frequencies of complementary bases reflect the progressive depletion of C
residues and accumulation of U’s by the APOBEC-like mutational process on the genomic (+) strand of
coronaviruses. Culminating in the compositionally highly abnormal HKU1 sequences (32), this appears
to have driven down the G+C content of coronaviruses as low as 32% while remarkably leaving G and
A frequencies more or less unaltered (Fig. 7). Intriguingly, the bat-derived coronaviruses along with

275

the recently zoonotically transferred viruses into humans show the least degree of compositional
asymmetry.

The expansions in APOBEC gene numbers, extensive positive selection and the consequent variability
in APOBEC nucleic acid targeting (20) may indeed create distinct selection pressures on coronaviruses
280

in different hosts. The immediate appearance of C->U hypermutation in SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV
genomes in humans may therefore represent the initial effects of replication in a more hostile internal
cellular environment than to be found in a better co-oadapted, virus-tolerised immune system of a
bat (34). Zoonotic origins are suspected for other human coronaviruses but at more remote times
(35); perhaps they have taken their mutational and adaptive journeys already.

MATERIALS AND METHODS

SARS-CoV-2 and other coronavirus datasets. The 1000 closest matched sequences to the prototype
290

strain of SARS-CoV-2, NC_045512, were downloaded on the 24th April, 2020. Sequences with large
internal gaps, ambiguous bases and other markers of poor sequence quality were excluded, leaving a
total of 865 sequences for analysis. This was divided into three data samples, corresponding to
sequences 1-300, 301-600 and 601-884. A further dataset of 117 well curated SARS-CoV-2 sequences
was downloaded from Konsiliarlabor für Coronaviren (https://civnb.info/sequences/) on the

295

13/04/2020 and represents a further independent sample set. A listing of further datasets of SARSCoV, MERS-CoV and other human coronaviruses is provided in Table 1. All sequence alignments
