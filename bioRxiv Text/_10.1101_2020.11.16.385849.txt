Abstract

25

Bat coronavirus (CoV) RaTG13 shares the highest genome sequence identity with

26

SARS-CoV-2 among all known coronaviruses, and also uses human angiotensin

27

converting enzyme 2 (hACE2) for virus entry. Thus, SARS-CoV-2 is thought to have

28

originated from bat. However, whether SARS-CoV-2 emerged from bats directly or

29

through an intermediate host remains elusive. Here, we found that Rhinolophus affinis

30

bat ACE2 (RaACE2) is an entry receptor for both SARS-CoV-2 and RaTG13,

31

although RaACE2 binding to the receptor binding domain (RBD) of SARS-CoV-2 is

32

markedly weaker than that of hACE2. We further evaluated the receptor activities of

33

ACE2s from additional 16 diverse animal species for RaTG13, SARS-CoV, and

34

SARS-CoV-2 in terms of S protein binding, membrane fusion, and pseudovirus entry.

35

We found that the RaTG13 spike (S) protein is significantly less fusogenic than

36

SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2, and seven out of sixteen different ACE2s function as

37

entry receptors for all three viruses, indicating that all three viruses might have broad

38

host rages. Of note, RaTG13 S pseudovirions can use mouse, but not pangolin ACE2,

39

for virus entry, whereas SARS-CoV-2 S pseudovirions can use pangolin, but limited

40

for mouse, ACE2s enter cells. Mutagenesis analysis revealed that residues 484 and

41

498 in RaTG13 and SARS-CoV-2 S proteins play critical roles in recognition of

42

mouse and human ACE2. Finally, two polymorphous Rhinolophous sinicus bat

43

ACE2s showed different susceptibilities to virus entry by RaTG13 and SARS-CoV-2

44

S pseudovirions，suggesting possible coevolution. Our results offer better

45

understanding of the mechanism of coronavirus entry, host range, and virus-host

46

coevolution.

Introduction
Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is caused by a newly emerged

50

coronavirus, severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), first

51

identified in late 2019 in Wuhan, China1-4, and currently it has spread to over 200

52

countries. On March 11, the World Health Organization declared a global pandemic of

53

COVID-19. As of August 23rd, there are more than 23 million confirmed cases and

54

over 800,000 deaths caused by SARS-CoV-2 worldwide5.

55

Phylogenetically, coronaviruses (CoVs) are classified into four genera, alpha,

56

beta, gamma, and delta, and beta-CoVs are further divided into four lineages, A, B, C,

57

and D. SARS-CoV-2 is a lineage B beta-CoV, including SARS-CoV and bat SARS-

58

like CoVs (SL-CoV)6,7. The genome of SARS-CoV-2 shares approximately 80% and

59

96.2% nucleotide sequence identity with SARS-CoV and bat SL-CoV RaTG13,

60

respectively3. The high sequence homology between SARS-CoV-2 and bat SL-CoVs

61

suggests that SARS-CoV-2 might originate from bats3,8,9. However, whether zoonotic

62

transmission from bats to humans is direct or through an intermediate animal host

63

remains to be determined.

64

CoVs use their trimeric spike (S) glycoproteins to bind the receptors and mediate

65

virus entry, and the interaction between the S protein and its cognate receptor largely

66

determines the virus host range and tissue tropism. The S protein contains two

67

subunits, S1 and S2. While S1 binds to the receptor, S2 contains the membrane fusion

68

machinery. Recently we and others showed that SARS-CoV-2 uses human angiotensin

69

converting enzyme 2 (hACE2) as the entry receptor3,10,11. The structure of hACE2 and

bioRxiv preprint doi: https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.11.16.385849; this version posted November 17, 2020. The copyright holder for this

70

the SARS-CoV-2 S protein or receptor binding domain (RBD) complex was also

71

solved recently12-15, and there are extensive interactions between the SARS-CoV-2 S

72

protein and hACE2, including 17 residues in the S protein and 20 residues in hACE2

73

(Table 1). Several critical residues, such as K31 and K353 in hACE2 and F486 and

74

Q498 in the S protein, were also identified. Many animals, including cats, ferrets,

75

minks, tigers, hamsters, dogs in lesser degree, are susceptible to SARS-CoV-2

76

infection16-22, indicating the potential broad host range of SARS-CoV-2.

77

RaTG13 was first discovered in the Rhinolophus affinis bat3, and it can use

78

hACE2 for virus entry13,23. CryoEM structure of its S protein in prefusion

79

conformation was also solved, and all three monomers in trimeric S proteins are in

80

“down” position24, revealing more stable in native conformation and significantly

81

lower affinity to hACE2 than SARS-CoV-2 S protein. Recently, Li et al reported that

82

SARS-CoV-2 and RaTG13 can use several domesticated animal orthologs of hACE2

83

for virus entry23. However, whether RaACE2 is a functional receptor for RaTG13 and

84

SARS-CoV-2 remains unknown. In this study, we determined the susceptibility of 17

85

diverse animal species including Rhinolophus affinis to SARS-CoV-2 and RaTG13

86

viruses by using their S pseudovirions, and found that RaACE2 and several other

87

ACE2s could efficiently mediate the entry of SARS-CoV-2, SARS-CoV, and RaTG13

88

virus. We further identified two residues, 484 and 498, that are critical for recognition

89

of mouse and human ACE2s

Results

91

To investigate the potential intermediate host for SARS-CoV-2, we determined

92

the receptor usage and host range of RaTG13 using a pseudotype system. We also

93

included the S protein of ZC45 in our study, sharing approximately 88% of genome

94

nucleotide sequence identity with that of SARS-CoV-2 2,25. Previously we found that

95

removal of a conserved ER-retention motif, KxHxx, increased the level of S protein

96

present on cell surface and incorporation into lentiviral pseudovirions10,26. Sequence

97

alignment of the S proteins of SARS-CoV, SARS-CoV-2, RaTG13, and ZC45

98

revealed that KxHxx motif was also present on the S proteins of RaTG13 and ZC45

99

(Fig 1A).The last 19 amino acids of the S proteins of RaTG13 and ZC45 were

100

removed and a 3xFLAG tag was also added to C-terminus of S proteins for detection.

101

The plasmids encoding the S proteins of RaTG13 and ZC45 were transfected into

102

293T cells, and the levels of S protein expression were evaluated by western blot

103

using various antibodies. The S proteins of RaTG13 and ZC45 were expressed at

104

levels similar to those of SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2, and they were readily

105

detected by monoclonal anti-FLAG M2 antibody (Fig 1B) and polyclonal anti-SARS-

106

CoV-2 S2 antibodies (Supplementary Fig 1A), suggesting that the immunoepitope(s)

107

for anti-SARS-CoV-2 S2 antibodies were also conserved among all four CoVs. The S

108

proteins of SARS-CoV-2 and RaTG13 were also detected by anti-SARS-CoV-2 RBD

109

antibodies, but weakly bound to rabbit polyclonal anti-SARS S1 antibody T62 and

110

mouse monoclonal anti-SARS S1 antibody MM02 (Supplementary Figs 1B, 1C, and

111

1D).

112

The level of S protein incorporation on pseudovirions was also evaluated. The S

113

proteins of RaTG13 and ZC45 were efficiently incorporated into pseudovirions (Fig

bioRxiv preprint doi: https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.11.16.385849; this version posted November 17, 2020. The copyright holder for this

114

1B and Supplementary Fig 1E). Next, we determined whether the RaTG13 and ZC45

115

S proteins can use any known coronavirus receptors for viral entry. The pseudovirions

116

were used to transduce HEK293 cells stably expressing hACE2 (293/hACE2),

117

HEK293 cells stably expressing hDPP4 (293/hDPP4), BHK cells stably expressing

118

human aminopeptidase N (BHK/hAPN), or HEK293 cells stably expressing mouse

119

carcinoembryonic antigen related cell adhesion molecule 1a (293/mCEACAM1a).

120

SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 S pseudovirions were used as controls. As expected,

121

SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 S pseudovirions utilized only hACE2, not

122

mCEACAM1a, hDPP4, or hAPN, for virus entry (Fig 1C). While 293/hDPP4,

123

BHK/hAPN, and 293/mCEACAM1a cells only showed background level of

124

transduction with RaTG13 S pseudovirions, 293/hACE2 cells gave approximately

125

850-fold increase in luciferase activities over the HEK293 control when transduced

126

by pseudovirions with RaTG13 S proteins, indicating that SL-CoV RaTG13 could use

127

hACE2 as the entry receptor, in agreement with previous report13,23. In contrast,

128

pseudovirions with ZC45 S protein did not transduce any cells effectively, indicating

129

that SL-CoV ZC45 could not use any of them for virus entry.

130

Because RaTG13 virus was initially and only discovered in specimens from a

131

single Rhinolophus affinis bat, we then investigated whether RaACE2 could also be

132

the entry receptor for RaTG13 virus or not. The binding of RaACE2 to the S protein

133

of RaTG13 was first evaluated. HEK293 cells transiently expressing RaACE2

134

proteins (Fig 1D) were incubated with soluble RaTG13 receptor binding domain

135

(RBD) and their affinities were measured by flow cytometry. The RaTG13 RBD

bioRxiv preprint doi: https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.11.16.385849; this version posted November 17, 2020. The copyright holder for this

136

bound to RaACE2 proteins efficiently, at a level similar to that of hACE2 (Fig 1E,

137

bottom panel). Of note, RaACE2 also bound to the SARS-CoV-2 RBD, but the

138

affinity was significantly weaker than that of the hACE2/SARS-CoV-2 RBD (Fig 1E,

139

top panel). The mean fluorescence intensity (MFI) of RaACE2/SARS-CoV-2 RBD

140

interaction was less than 1/3 of that of the hACE/SARS-CoV-2 RBD (Fig 1F).

141

RaTG13 RBD also demonstrated slightly weaker binding to hACE2 than SARS-CoV-

142

2 RBD. Next, we determined whether RaACE2 could mediate the entry of RaTG13

143

and SARS-CoV-2 viruses. RaTG13 S pseudovions entered 293/RaACE2 cells at a

144

level similar to hACE2, whereas SARS-CoV-2 S pseudovirions also transduced

145

293/RaACE2 cells efficiently, at slightly lower levels than hACE2 (Fig 1G). RaACE2

146

is a functional entry receptor for both RaTG13 and SARS-CoV-2 viruses.

147

Recently cats, civets, ferrets, minks, tigers, hamsters, dogs, and monkeys were

148

reported to be susceptible to SARS-CoV-2 infection 16-21, and in silico analysis also

149

showed that ACE2 from other animals might be able to mediate SARS-CoV-2 entry22.

150

We next investigated which other animal ACE2 could confer susceptibility to RaTG13

151

virus entry. Sixteen different animal species (Table 1) were chosen, most of which are

152

commonly found in wild animal meat markets in China, and we also included

153

pangolins and two horseshoe bats (Rhinolophus sinicus), one from Yunnan (RS-YN

154

bat), and the other from Hubei (RS-HB bat) in this study27, due to the discovery of

155

some CoVs that are highly homologous to SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 in them9,28-

156
157

. Among the 20 residues in hACE2 making direct contact with SARS-CoV-2 S

proteins (Table 1), deer ACE2 differs in three positions with hACE2, squirrel has four

158

residues that are different, ACE2s of fox, camel, pig, and RS-HB bat each have five

159

residues that are different, RS-YN bat ACE2 has six residues that are different, ACE2s

160

of pangolin, ferret, and guinea pig each have seven different, both rat and mouse

161

ACE2s have eight residues different, and ACE2s of the remaining animals have nine

162

or more residues different with hACE2 (Table 1). The plasmids encoding individual

163

ACE2 proteins from these 16 different animal species (total 17, two horseshoe bats)

164

were transfected into 293 cells, and the levels of their expression in 293 cells were

165

determined by western blot (Fig 2A). While all ACE2 proteins were expressed in 293

166

cells (Fig 2A), expression levels varied among different ACE2 proteins, with the

167

lowest for deer and snake ACE2s and the largest for hedgehog ACE2. The size for

168

different ACE2 proteins also varied. While the deer ACE2 was the smallest, turtle

169

ACE2 was the biggest. The deer ACE2 sequence we obtained from Genbank seems to

170

lack the transmembrane domain (TMD) of ACE2, indicating that there might be

171

different splicing variants of ACE2 in deer. We then investigated whether all different

172

ACE2 proteins were present on the cell surface using a surface biotinylation assay.

173

Except for the deer ACE2 protein, which lacked a TMD, most ACE2 proteins were

174

present on the cell surface (Fig 2B). However, the levels of ACE2 proteins from

175

guinea pigs and snakes were significantly lower on the cell surface than on the other

176

surfaces. Integrin-β1 was used as the positive control for cell surface membrane

177

proteins (Fig 2B). Because of the lack of TMD, the deer ACE2 was then removed

178

from the rest of the analysis.

179

Next we determined whether these different ACE2 proteins could bind to the S

180

proteins of RaTG13. For comparison purposes, we also included SARS-CoV and

181

SARS-CoV-2 in the rest of the experiments. HEK293 cells transiently expressing

182

different ACE2 proteins were incubated with soluble RaTG13, SARS-CoV, and

183

SARS-CoV-2 receptor binding domains (RBDs), and the percentage of cells that

184

bound the RBD and the level of RBD bound to different ACE2 proteins were

185

quantitated by flow cytometry (Fig 3 and Supplementary Fig 2). All RBDs of

186

RaTG13, SARS-CoV-2, and SARS-CoV bound to HEK293 cells transiently

187

expressing hACE2 protein, with RaTG13 RBD showing slightly lower levels of

188

binding than SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 RBDs (Supplementary Fig 2), consistent

189

with the slightly lower transduction on 293/hACE2 by RaTG13 S pseudovirion than

190

SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 S pseudovirions (Fig 1C). Fox, camel, and pig ACE2

191

proteins also gave strong binding to RBDs of RaTG13, SARS-CoV, and SARS-CoV-2

192

at levels similar to hACE2 (Fig 3). In contrast, rat ACE2 proteins also bound to all

193

three RBDs, but only at modest levels, ranging from 16% to 28% of hACE2. While

194

squirrel and mouse ACE2 proteins bound strongly to RBDs of RaTG13 and SARS-

195

CoV, they only bound to SARS-CoV-2 RBD at levels that were 36% and 12% of

196

hACE2, respectively. In contrast, pangolin ACE2 proteins showed high affinity for

197

both SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 RBDs, but only weakly bound to RaTG13 RBD.

198

SARS-CoV RBD bound civet and ferret ACE2 proteins at levels similar to hACE2,

199

whereas SARS-CoV-2 RBD only showed binding to these ACE2 proteins at levels

200

that were 24% and 15% of hACE2, respectively, and RaTG13 RBD only showed

201

background level of binding. Of note, the RaTG13 and SARS-CoV-2 RBDs showed

bioRxiv preprint doi: https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.11.16.385849; this version posted November 17, 2020. The copyright holder for this

202

modest and strong binding to the ACE2 proteins of the RS-YN bat, respectively, but

203

neither bound to the ACE2 proteins of the RS-HB bat (Fig 3A and 3B), in which there

204

were seven S protein-interacting residues differing from those of RS-YN bat (Table

205

1). In contrast, SARS-CoV RBD showed modest but consistent binding to the RS-HB

206

bat, not RS-YN bat (Fig 3C), reflecting the differences of receptor-contacting residues

207

in RBDs among the three CoVs. None of ACE2 proteins from the other animal

208

species showed any significant binding to either one of three RBDs. Overall, the

209

fewer the number of critical binding residues that differ from hACE2 (Table 1), the

210

higher the levels of binding detected. Both the RaTG13 and SARS-CoV-2 RBDs

211

showed high affinity to ACE2 proteins of five different animals at levels of 60% or

212

above that of hACE2, where SARS-CoV RBD bound to ACE2 proteins of seven

213

different animals at 60% or above that of hACE2, indicating their potential broad

214

range of hosts.

215

Membrane fusion is a prerequisite step for virus entry. We next evaluated the

216

effect of different animal ACE2 proteins on the S protein of RaTG13 mediated

217

membrane fusion by cell-cell fusion assay. SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 S proteins

218

were also used for comparisons. In agreement with our previous report10, HEK293

219

cells transiently expressing hACE2 proteins showed extensive syncytium formation

220

when coincubated with 293T cells overexpressing eGFP and SARS-CoV or SARS-

221

CoV-2 S proteins in the presence of trypsin (Fig 4A). Syncytia were also induced

222

when RaTG13 S protein expressing cells were overlaid on HEK293 cells transiently

223

expressing hACE2 with trypsin. However, the frequency and size of the syncytium

224

were much lower and smaller than the S proteins of SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2

225

(8.7% for RaTG13, 37.3% for SARS-CoV-2, and 29.1% for SARS-CoV) (Fig 4A, 4B,

226

4C, 4D and Supplementary Figure 3). Of note, HEK293 cells expressing fox and rat

227

ACE2 proteins, and to a lesser extent, squirrel and mouse ACE2 proteins showed

228

significantly higher amount of syncytium formation than hACE2 when mixed with

229

RaTG13 S protein expressing cells and trypsin (Fig 4B), although all were present on

230

the cell surface at similar level (Fig 2B). Camel ACE2 also induced syncytia at a level

231

similar to hACE2, whereas civet, ferret and pig ACE2s showed syncytia at 65%, 49%

232

and 61% of hACE2, respectively. None of the other animal ACE2s, including ACE2s

233

from two horseshoe bats, induced marked syncytium formation by RaTG13 S

234

proteins. Overall, the cell-cell fusion results were largely in agreement with the ability

235

of ACE2 proteins

binding RaTG13 RBD.

236

The S protein of SARS-CoV-2 induced extensive syncytia on HEK293 cells

237

transiently expressing squirrel, pangolin, fox, civet, camel, ferret, rat, mouse, pig, and

238

RS-YN bat ACE2 proteins (Fig 4C), although ferret, rat, and mouse ACE2 protein

239

only showed binding to the SARS-CoV-2 RBD slightly above background level (Fig

240

3B). Because several recent studies reported that mouse ACE2 is not susceptible to

241

SARS-CoV-2 infection3,31, we repeated the cell-cell fusion experiments multiple times

242

with mouse ACE2 plasmids, prepared with extra caution and verified by sequencing,

243

and significant amount of syncytia were still detected (Supplementary Figure 4). All

244

other animal ACE2 proteins gave background levels of syncytia, consistent with their

245

inability to bind to the SARS-CoV-2 RBD. The overall pattern of SARS-CoV S

246

protein mediated syncytium formation on different animal ACE2 expressing 293 cells

247

was similar to that of SARS-CoV-2 S protein. Of note, although RS-YN bat ACE2 did

248

not show any marked binding to SARS-CoV RBD, it induced SARS-CoV S protein

249

mediated syncytium formation at a level of 62% of hACE2. HEK293 cells expressing

250

RS-HB bat and guinea pig ACE2 also induced noticeable syncytium formation upon

251

addition of SARS-CoV S expressing 293T cells and trypsin (Fig 4D). Overall, the S

252

proteins of SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 showed much higher fusogenicity than the

253

RaTG13 S proteins.

254

Next we investigated whether ACE2 proteins from different animal species could

255

mediate virus entry by the RaTG13, SARS-CoV, and SARS-CoV-2 S proteins.

256

Lentiviral pseudovirions with VSV-G protein were used as a positive control. As

257

expected, all cells were susceptible to VSV-G pseudoviron transduction (Fig 5).

258

Compared to vector control, 293/hACE2 cells showed an over 3500-fold increase in

259

luciferase activities when transduced with RaTG13 S pseudovirions (Fig 5A). Over a

260

1000-fold increase of transduction was also detected in HEK293 cells transiently

261

overexpressing squirrel, fox, camel, and mouse ACE2 proteins (Fig 5A), indicating

262

that they might be susceptible to RaTG13 infection. Rats and pigs also seem to be

263

susceptible to RaTG13 infection, and their ACE2s resulted in over 225- and 630-fold

264

increases in luciferase activities (Fig 5A), respectively, when transduced by RaTG13

265

S pseudovirions, largely in agreement with their ability to

266

contrast, although civet and ferret ACE2 only showed minimal binding to the RaTG13

267

RBD, they gave close to 500- and 90-fold increases in luciferase over the vector

bind to RaTG13 RBD. In

268

control (Fig 5A), respectively, when transduced by RaTG13 pseudovirons, indicating

269

that they might also be susceptible to RaTG13 infection. Of note, neither horseshoe

270

bat ACE2s t showed high susceptibility to RaTG13 S pseudovirion transduction.

271

While RS-YN bat ACE2 gave an approximately 13-fold increase in transduction over

272

the vector control, RS-HB bat ACE2 only showed a background level of transduction

273

(Fig 5A). None of the other animal ACE2s showed a significant increase in virus

274

entry by the RaTG13 S protein.

275

Overall, SARS-CoV-2 S protein pseudovirions showed similar levels of host

276

ranges to RaTG13 among the different ACE2s we tested (Fig 5B). However, they

277

differed dramatically in susceptibility to pangolins and mice. Pangolin ACE2 was

278

susceptible to SARS-CoV-2 S-mediated transduction (Fig 5B), but not RaTG13 (Fig

279

5A), whereas mouse ACE2 was fully susceptible to RaTG13 transduction (Fig 5A),

280

but limited to SARS-CoV-2 (Fig 5B). SARS-CoV-2 S pseudovirions showed only

281

0.4% of hACE2 transduction in mouse ACE2 (Fig 5C). HEK293 transiently

282

overexpressing squirrel and pig ACE2s gave a level of transduction similar to that of

283

hACE2 (Fig 5B), although squirrel ACE2 bound to the SARS-CoV-2 RBD at a level

284

of less than 40% of that of hACE2 (Fig 3B). Fox, civet, camel, rat, or RS-YN bat

285

ACE2 proteins also gave an over 100-fold increase in luciferase activities (Fig 5C),

286

indicating that these animals might be susceptible to SARS-CoV-2 infection. Ferret

287

ACE2 also showed an approximately 35-fold increase in transduction (Fig 5C), in

288

agreement with recent studies showing that ferrets were susceptible to SARS-CoV-2

289

infection32,33. RS-HB bat and guinea pig ACE2 proteins only gave approximately 15-

290

and 10-fold increases in transduction by SARS-CoV-2 S pseudovirions, in agreement

291

with their low affinity of binding to SARS-CoV-2 S protein. Compared to RaTG13

292

and SARS-CoV-2, SARS-CoV S showed broader host range. HEK293 cells

293

transiently expressing squirrel, pangolin, fox, civet, camel, ferret, rat, mouse, pig, RS-

294

YN bat, RS-HB bat, guinea pig, and koala ACE2 showed marked increases in

295

luciferase activities (Fig 5B), when transduced by SARS-CoV S pseudovirions. Of

296

note, both RS-YN and RS-HB bat ACE2 proteins showed a more than 100-fold

297

increase in transduction (Fig 5C), compared to vector control, although they exhibited

298

substantial differences in binding to the SARS-CoV RBD and syncytium formation

299

(Fig 4D).

300

To identify the residues in the S proteins of RaTG13 and SARS-CoV-2 critical for

301

the interaction and recognition of ACE2 in different animal species, we applied in

302

silico analyses of SARS-CoV-2/RaTG13 RBDs and different ACE2 interactions using

303

HAWKDOCK and PYMOL (Supplementary Fig 5), particularly focusing on mouse

304

and pangolin ACE2. In the SARS-CoV-2 RBD/hACE2 crystal structure, interactions

305

between hACE2 and the SARS-CoV-2 RBD complex consist of extensive network of

306

hydrogen bonding salt bridges and hydrophobic interactions (Supplementary Fig 5A,

307

5B, 5C and 5D)12,14. F28, L79, M82, and Y83 in hACE2 form a hydrophobic pocket

308

interacting with the critical F486 in the SARS-CoV-2 S protein34 (Supplementary Fig

309

5B). L79T, M82S, and Y83F changes in mouse ACE2 might collapse this

310

hydrophobic pocket and weaken the interaction with F486 in S protein

311

(Supplementary Fig 5E). The D30N change in mouse ACE2 likely abrogates the salt

312

bridge with K417 in the S protein of SARS-CoV-2, and K31N and K353H changes in

313

mouse ACE2 also likely disrupt the hydrogen bonding network between ACE2 and

314

SARS-CoV-2 S protein, resulting in mouse ACE2 acting as a poor receptor for SARS-

315

CoV-2. In contrast, K439, Y493 and Y498 in the RaTG13 S protein might make

316

hydrogen bonds with Q325, N31 and Q42 in mouse ACE2(Supplementary Fig 5E),

317

resulting in an increase in the overall affinity between mouse ACE2 and the RaTG13

318

S protein (Fig 3A) and virus entry by the RaTG13 virus (Fig 5A).

319

Pangolin ACE2 differs from human ACE2 at seven critical positions making

320

contact with the RBD (Table 1), of which three (E30, E38, and I79) are homologous

321

and four (E24, S34S, N82, and H354) are different. While these changes do not affect

322

SARS-CoV-2 RBD binding to pangolin ACE2 (Supplementary Fig 5F), they appear to

323

be detrimental to RaTG13 RBD binding (Fig 3A) and virus entry (Fig 5A). In silico

324

analysis showed that Y449F, E484T and Q493Y changes in RaTG13 S protein might

325

disrupt their hydrogen bonding with E38, K31, and E35 of pangolin ACE2,

326

respectively (Supplementary Fig 5F), resulting in weak interaction between RaTG13

327

S protein and pangolin ACE2 and poor transduction efficiency of pangolin ACE2 by

328

RaTG13 S protein (Fig 5A).

329

Based on the results from the in silico analysis, we selected residues 449, 484,

330

493, and 498 in the S proteins for further studies (Fig 6A). Single mutations F449Y,

331

T484E, Y493Q, and Y498Q were introduced into the RaTG13 S protein, and

332

individual Y449F, E484T, Q493Y, and Q498Y mutations were also introduced into the

333

SARS-CoV-2 S protein. All mutant RaTG13 S proteins were expressed as well as WT

334

in HEK293T cells and incorporated into pseudovirion efficiently (Fig 6B), whereas all

335

mutant SARS-CoV-2 S proteins except for Y493Q were expressed and incorporated

336

into pseudovirions at levels similar to WT (Fig 6C). Because Q493Y mutation in

337

SARS-CoV-2 S had significant effect on S protein incorporation into pseudovirions,

338

they were removed from further analysis. We then determined whether any mutations

339

affected virus entry using hACE2. While both the F449Y and Y498Q mutations in the

340

RaTG13 S protein significantly reduced virus entry into 293/hACE2 cells (Fig 6D),

341

indicating that both F449 and Y498 of RaTG13 might be critical for virus entry

342

through hACE2, the Y493Q substitution in the RaTG13 S protein significantly

343

increased transduction into hACE2 cells, suggesting that Q might be advantageous at

344

position 493 for interaction with hACE2. In contrast, only the Y449F mutation in the

345

SARS-CoV-2 protein showed greater than 50% reduction in infectivity in 293/hACE2

346

cells (Fig 6E). Next, we investigated whether any mutations influenced virus entry

347

into mouse and pangolin ACE2s. The overall patterns of mutant RaTG13 S

348

pseudovirion infectivity in mouse ACE2 cells were very similar to those on hACE2

349

cells except for T484E (Fig 6F and 6G). The F449Y, T484E, and Y498Q mutant

350

RaTG13 S proteins showed a significant reduction in infectivity on mouse ACE2,

351

whereas the Y493Q substitution slightly increased transduction on mouse ACE2 by

352

RaTG13 S pseudovirions (Fig 6F). These results suggested that residues 449, 484, and

353

498 of RaTG13 S protein might also be important for interaction with mouse ACE2

354

and that Q might be preferred over Y at position 493 of the RaTG13 S protein to

355

interact mouse ACE2. None of the mutations could significantly rescue the infection

of RaTG13 S pseudovirions on pangolin ACE2 expressing cells (Fig 6F). The effects

357

of individual mutations in SARS-CoV-2 S proteins on virus entry through pangolin

358

ACE2 were relatively limited (Fig 6G), and very similar to those in hACE2 cells (Fig

359

6E). Y449F and E484T mutants showed slightly over 50% and 30% reduction in

360

infectivity in pangolin ACE2-expressing cells, respectively, whereas Q498Y

361

mutations in SARS-CoV-2 had no effect on virus entry into pangolin ACE2

362

expressing cells. Strikingly, mutant E484T and Q498Y SARS-CoV-2 S proteins

363

increased transduction on mouse ACE2 expressing cells by more than 16 and 70-fold,

364

respectively, indicating that residues 484 and 498 of SARS-CoV-2 S proteins might

365

play critical roles in determining receptor usage of mouse ACE2.

Discussion

368

Viral entry is the first step for zoonotic transmission, and the interaction between

369

the host receptor and viral S protein determines the host range and viral tropism.

370

Although the origin of SARS-CoV-2 remains unknown, RaTG13 has been speculated

371

to be the possible origin of SARS-CoV-23,8,9,35, because the genomes of SARS-CoV-2

372

and bat SL-CoV RaTG13 share the highest nucleotide sequence identity. Here we

373

showed that, although both SARS-CoV-2 and RaTG13 could use hACE2 for virus

374

entry, the S proteins of the two CoVs have marked differences in biological

375

properties, in terms of their affinity to ACE2s of different animal species, their

376

fusogenicity in membrane fusion, and virus entry using different ACE2 proteins,

377

especially for pangolin and mouse ACE2s, supporting the hypothesis that SARS-CoV-

378

2 might not arise from RaTG13 virus directly, consistent with previous analysis36,37.

379

The RaTG13 virus was originally found in specimens from a Rhinolophus affinis

380

bat3, indicating that the Rhinolophus affinis bat might be a natural host for the

381

RaTG13 virus. Our finding of RaACE2 as a functional entry receptor for RaTG13

382

virus (Fig 1E and 1G) provides the first direct evidence of this. In fact, RaACE2 was

383

almost as efficient as hACE2 in binding to RaTG13 RBD and facilitating entry of

384

RaTG13 S pseudovirions (Fig 1E and 1G). In contrast, SARS-CoV-2 clearly favored

385

hACE over RaACE2 for receptor binding and modestly favor hACE2 over RaACE2

386

for virus entry (Fig 1E, 1F, and 1G), reflecting possible adaptation of SARS-CoV-2 in

387

human beings or an unknown intermediate host, if SARS-CoV-2 evolved from

388

RaTG13 or a RaTG13-like virus. There are four residues (R24, I27, N31, and N82) in

389

RaACE2 that differ from hACE2 (Table 1). In silico analysis revealed that K31N and

390

M82N changes in RaACE2 likely reduce hydrogen and hydrophobic interactions with

391

the SARS-CoV RBD (Supplementary Fig 6), respectively, resulting in a decrease in

392

overall affinity. In contrast, R24 in RaACE2 likely forms an extra hydrogen bond with

393

S477 in the RaTG13 RBD but not S477 in SARS-CoV-2 (distance:2.8 Å vs 4.1 Å),

394

stabilizing the interaction between RaACE2 and the RaTG13 RBD.

395

Identification of a direct natural animal reservoir and/or zoonotic intermediate

396

host of SARS-CoV-2 is essential to prevent future emergence and re-emergence of

397

SARS-CoV-2 or SARS-CoV-2 like viruses. Recently, several novel pangolin CoVs

398

were discovered in Malayan pangolins rescued during an anti-smuggling campaign in

399

Guangdong, China9,28-30. Among them, one RBD was almost identical to the SARS-

400

CoV-2 RBD in terms of amino acid sequence, except for one single noncritical

401

residue9, leading to the hypothesis that SARS-CoV-2 might result from recombination

402

of RaTG13-like CoV and pangolin CoV and pangolin might be the intermediate host

403

for SARS-CoV-29,28,30. Pangolin ACE2 not only showed strong binding to SARS-

404

CoV-2 S protein (Fig 3B) and triggered large syncytia mediated by SARS-CoV-2 S

405

protein (Fig 4C), but HEK293 cells expressing pangolin ACE2 were also highly

406

susceptible to SARS-CoV-2 S protein mediated virus entry, suggesting that pangolin

407

should be susceptible to SARS-CoV-2 infection. However, RaTG13 RBD only

408

showed very limited binding to pangolin ACE2 (Fig 3B), its S protein only induced

409

background level of syncytia on HEK293 cells transiently expressing pangolin ACE2

410

(Fig 4C), and RaTG13 S pseudovirions also only gave background level of

411

transduction on HEK293 cells transiently expressing pangolin ACE2 (Fig 5A),

412

indicating that RaTG13 virus might not be able to infect pangolin. This raises the

413

question of whether pangolins could be intermediate hosts for SARS-CoV-2 if

414

RaTG13 or RaTG13-like viruses could not infect pangolins. Moreover, pangolins are

415

solitary animals, and infection by these pangolin CoVs is lethal for most pangolins9,

416

suggesting that these pangolin CoVs might not be native to pangolins. Recent studies

417

on 334 Sunda pangolins did not find any CoVs or other potential zoonotic viruses in

418

these animals38, further supporting that pangolins might not be reservoir hosts for

419

these pangolin CoVs. Where, when, and how these pangolins acquired these CoVs

420

remain elusive.

421

Among the 17 different ACE2s we tested, squirrel and pig ACE2s were highly

422

susceptible to transduction by all SARS-CoV, SARS-CoV-2, and RaTG13 S

423

pseudovirions (Fig 5), although recent studies reported that pigs might not be

424

permissive to SARS-CoV-2 infection17,39, likely resulting from low level of

425

expression of ACE2 proteins on pig respiratory track22. Fox, civet, camel, ferret, and

426

rat were also susceptible to virus entry by all three S pseudovirions (Fig 5), indicating

427

the potential broad host range of all three viruses. Ferret has been used as a SARS-

428

CoV-2 infection and transmission model17,32,33,40. Whether any of these other

429

susceptible animals could be used as animal models for SARS-CoV-2 remains to be

430

determined, especially for rats, which are cheaper and widely available. More

431

importantly, whether any of these susceptible animals might be potential intermediate

432

hosts for SARS-CoV-2 warrants further investigation.

433

Of note, while SARS-CoV-2 could bind and use pangolin ACE2 for virus entry,

434

its ability to use mouse ACE2 was very limited, and conversely, RaTG13 could bind

435

and use mouse ACE2 for virus entry, but not pangolin ACE2. Among the 20 residues

436

making direct contact with SARS-CoV-2 S proteins (Table 1), mouse ACE2 protein

437

differs at eight RBD-interacting residues from human ACE2 (Table 1), whereas

438

pangolin ACE2 has seven critical positions differing from hACE2 (Table 1). In silico

439

analyses showed that multiple amino acid changes in mouse ACE2, including D30N,

440

K31N, and K353H, likely disrupt the salt bridge and hydrogen bonding network

441

between ACE2 and SARS-CoV-2 S protein, whereas several changes in RaTG13 S

442

protein, including N439K, F486L, Q493Y, and Q498Y (N, F, Q, Q from SARS-CoV-2

443

S and K, L, Y, Y from RaTG13 S), might reestablish the interactions with mouse

444

ACE2 (Supplementary Fig 5E). This notion is strongly supported by the results for the

445

Q498Y mutation in the SARS-CoV-2 S protein and the Y498Q mutation in the

446

RaTG13 S protein. Replacement of Q498 with Y increased the infectivity of SARS-

447

CoV-2 S pseudovirions on mouse ACE2 expressing cells by more than 70-fold. In

448

contrast, substitution of Y498 with Q almost abrogated transduction by RaTG13 S

449

pseudovirions on mouse ACE2, indicating the importance of residue 498 of both the

450

RaTG13 and SARS-CoV-2 S proteins in the recognition of the mouse ACE2 protein.

451

Of note, Q498 mutations were found in two recent mouse adapted SARS-CoV-2

452

strains, Q498H in one41, and Q498T in the other31. We did not identify any residue in

453

the S protein essential for interacting with pangolin ACE2. Y449F, E484T, and

454

Q498Y substitutions in the SARS-CoV-2 S protein had moderate effect on virus entry

455

into pangolin ACE2 cells, and none of the mutations in the RaTG13 S protein

456

significantly increased virus infectivity in 293/pangolin ACE2 cells.

457

RS-YN bat ACE2 showed strong binding to SARS-CoV-2, induced syncytium

458

formation effectively, and was susceptible to transduction by SARS-CoV-2 S

459

pseudovirions, consistent with previous reports3. In silico analysis (Supplementary

460

Figure 5) revealed that Y449, E484, and Q493 in SARS-CoV-2 S could form

461

hydrogen bonds with D38, K31, and T34 in RS-YN bat ACE2, resulting in strong

462

binding of SARS-CoV-2 RBD with RS-YN bat ACE2. In contrast, although RS-HB

463

bat ACE2 has only a 5 amino acid difference from hACE2 and one fewer than RS-YN

464

bat ACE2, it only showed a background level of binding to SARS-CoV-2. K31E,

465

T34S, and D38N changes in RS-HB bat ACE2 might disrupt their hydrogen bonding

466

with E484, Q493, and Y449 of SARS-CoV-2 RBD, respectively, critical for SARS-

467

CoV-2 RBD and bat ACE2 interaction (Supplementary Figure 5). Both RS bat ACE2s

468

seem to be poor receptors for RaTG13 virus. Y449F, E484T, and Q493Y changes in

469

RaTG13 might abolish those critical hydrogen bonds, leading to very limited binding

470

to both RS bat ACE2 (Fig 3B), background level of syncytium formation (Fig 4B),

471

and limited virus entry by RaTG13 S pseudovirions (Fig 5A). Whether failure of

472

SARS-CoV-2and RaTG13 using RS-HB bat ACE2 for virus entry might result from

473

pathogen-driven host revolution remains to be determined. Although SARS-CoV-2

474

likely evolved from bat-CoV RaTG13 or RaTG13-like bat-CoV with or without

475

recombination with other CoVs, the difference in susceptibility of the two RS bat

476

ACE2s between SARS-CoV-2 and RaTG13 raises two important questions: 1. Which

477

bat species other than Rhinolophus affinis might harbor RaTG13 or RaTG13-like

478

virus? 2. How does RaTG13 or RaTG13-like CoV evolve to SARS-CoV-2?

479

In summary, we determined the susceptibility of bat-CoV RaTG13 to 17 diverse

480

animal ACE2s and compared them with those of SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV. We

481

found that RaACE2 is an entry receptor for RaTG13 and SARS-CoV-2. All three

482

CoVs likely have a broad host range with SARS-CoV being the broadest, and mice,

483

not pangolins, are susceptible to RaTG13 infection, whereas pangolins, not mice, are

484

susceptible to SARS-CoV-2 infection. Residues 484 and 498 in the S protein play

485

critical roles in the recognition of mouse and human ACE2.

Soluble RBD binding assay. HEK293 cells were transfected with plasmids encoding

538

different ACE2 orthologs (Table S1) by polyetherimide (PEI) (Sigma, St Louis, MO,

539

USA). After 40 hrs incubation, cells were washed with PBS, lifted with PBS

540

containing 1 mM EDTA, and immediately washed twice with PBS with 2% FBS.

541

About 2x105 cells were incubated with 5 g of soluble RATG13，SARS-CoV-2，or

542

SARS-CoV RBD for 1 hr on ice. After washing three times with PBS with 2% FBS,

543

cells were incubated with rabbit polyclonal anti-6xHis antibody (1:200 dilution)

544

(Shanghai Enzyme-Linked Biotechnology Co., Shanghai, China), followed by

545

incubation with Alexa Fluor 488-conjugated goat anti-rabbit IgG (1:200). Cells were

546

fixed with 1% paraformaldehyde and analyzed by flow cytometry.

547

Pseudovirion production and transduction. For pseudotyped virion production,

548

HEK-293 cells were transfected with psPAX2, pLenti-GFP, and plasmids encoding

549

either SARS-CoV-2 S, SARS-CoV S, RaTG13 S, or ZC45 S protein at equal molar

550

ratios by PEI. After 40 hrs of incubation, viral supernatants were harvested and

551

centrifuged at 800 g for 5 min to remove cell debris. For transduction, receptor-

552

expressing cells were seeded into 24-well plates at 30-40% confluence. The next day,

553

cells were inoculated with 500 l viral supernatant, followed by spin-inoculation at

554

800g for 30 min. After overnight incubation, cells were fed with fresh media, and

555

cells were lysed with 120 l of lysis buffer (ratio of medium and Steady-glo

556

(Promega) at 1:1) at 48 hrs postinoculation. The luciferase activities were quantified

557

by using a Modulus II microplate reader (Turner Biosystems, Sunnyvale, CA, USA).

558

All experiments were performed in triplicate and repeated at least twice.

559

Detection of S protein by western blot. Briefly, HEK293T cells transfected with

560

plasmids encoding either SARS-CoV, SARS-CoV-2, bat SL-CoV RaTG13, or bat SL-

561

CoV ZC45 S proteins were lysed at 40 hrs post transfection by RIPA buffer (20 mM

562

Tris-HCl pH 7.5, 150 mM NaCl, 1 mM EDTA, 0.1% SDS, 1% NP40, 1× protease

563

inhibitor cocktail). After 30 min of incubation on ice, cell lysate was centrifuged at

564

12,000g for 10 min at 4C to remove nuclei. To pellet down pseudovirions, viral

565

supernatants were centrifuged at 25,000 rpm for 2 hrs in a Beckman SW41 rotor at

566

4°C through a 20% sucrose cushion, and virion pellets were resuspended in 30 μl

567

RIPA buffer. The samples were boiled for 10 min, separated in a 10% SDS-PAGE gel

568

(WB1102, Beijing Biotides Biotechnology, Beijing, China) and transferred to

569

nitrocellulose filter membranes. After blocking with 5% milk, the membranes were

570

blotted with primary antibodies, followed by horseradish peroxidase (HRP)

571

conjugated secondary antibodies (1:5000), and visualized with Chemiluminescent

580

Cell surface protein biotinylation assay. To determine the level of ACE2s of each

581

species on the cell surface, FLAG-tagged ACE2 expressing cells at 80-90%

582

confluence were incubated with PBS containing 2.5 g/mL EZ-linked Sulfo-NHS-

583

LC-LC-biotin (Thermo-Pierce, #21388) on ice for 30 min after washing with ice-cold

584

PBS. Then, the reaction was quenched by PBS with 100 mM glycine and cells were

585

lysed with RIPA buffer. To pull-down the proteins labeled with biotin, the lysates were

586

incubated with NeutrAvidin beads (Thermo-Pierce, #53150) overnight at 4°C . After

587

washing 3 times with RIPA buffer, samples were resuspended in 30 l of loading

588

buffer and boiled for 10 min, and the level of ACE2 expression was determined by

589

western-blotting using an anti-FLAG M2 antibody (1:1000). Integrin-β1 were serving

590

as a control.

MetaMorph software (Molecular Devices). All experiments were performed in

598

triplicate and repeated at least three times. Three images for each sample were

599

selected, and the total number of nuclei and the number of nuclei in fused cells for

600

each image were counted. The fusion efficiency was calculated as the number of

601

nuclei in syncytia/total number of nuclei x100.

602

Structure modeling. The PDB files of the crystal structures of hACE2/SARS-CoV-2

603

(6m0j)and hACE2/SARS-CoV (2ajf) and the cryo-EM structure of the RaTG13 spike

604

glycoprotein (6zgf) were downloaded from the RCSB PDB website (www.rcsb.org).

605

Homology models of the receptor binding domain (RBD) of different host ACE2s

606

were built with the Structuropedia web server (mod.farooq.ac). Hot spot residues were

607

predicted with the Hotpoint web server (prism.ccbb.ku.edu.tr/hotpoint)42,43. The RBD

608

structures of SARS-CoV-2, SARS-CoV, and RaTG13 were extracted from the pdb

609

files and docked into the homology models with the HADDOCK server

610

(wenmr.science.uu.nl)44, using conserved active residues on the interfaces as docking

611

restraints. Docking poses were viewed, aligned, and analyzed with PyMOL software.
