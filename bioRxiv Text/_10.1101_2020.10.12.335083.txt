Abstract
Currently, the world is suffering from the pandemic of coronavirus disease 2019
(COVID-19), caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) that
uses angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) as a receptor to enter the host cells. So far, 30
million people have been infected with SARS-CoV-2, and nearly 1 million people have died
because of COVID-19 worldwide, causing serious health, economical, and sociological
problems. However, the mechanism of the effect of SARS-CoV-2 on human host cells has not
been defined. The present study reports that the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein alone without the
rest of the viral components is sufficient to elicit cell signaling in lung vascular cells. The
treatment of human pulmonary artery smooth muscle cells or human pulmonary artery
endothelial cells with recombinant SARS-CoV-2 spike protein S1 subunit (Val16 – Gln690) at
10 ng/ml (0.13 nM) caused an activation of MEK phosphorylation. The activation kinetics was
transient with a peak at 10 min. The recombinant protein that contains only the ACE2 receptorbinding domain of SARS-CoV-2 spike protein S1 subunit (Arg319 – Phe541), on the other hand,
did not cause this activation. Consistent with the activation of cell growth signaling in lung
vascular cells by SARS-CoV-2 spike protein, pulmonary vascular walls were found to be
thickened in COVID-19 patients. Thus, SARS-CoV-2 spike protein-mediated cell growth
signaling may participate in adverse cardiovascular/pulmonary outcomes, and this mechanism
may provide new therapeutic targets to combat COVID-19.

1. Introduction
Coronaviruses are positive sense single stranded RNA viruses that often cause the
common cold [1,2]. Some coronaviruses can, however, be lethal. Currently, the world is
suffering from the pandemic of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) caused by severe acute
respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) [3,4]. So far, 30 million people have been
infected with SARS-CoV-2 worldwide, causing serious health, economical, and sociological
problems. SARS-CoV-2 uses angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) as a receptor to enter the
host cells [5,6]. Lung cells are the primary targets of SARS-CoV-2, resulting in severe
pneumonia and acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) [7,8]. So far, nearly 1 million people
have died because of COVID-19.
t has been noted that certain populations of infected individuals are severely affected by

I

and die of COVID-19. Elderly patients with systemic hypertension and other cardiovascular
diseases are particularly susceptible to developing severe and possibly fatal conditions [4,9,10].
Thus, managing the pulmonary and cardiovascular aspects of COVID-19 is considered to be the
key for reducing the severity of COVID-19 and the associated mortality. However, it is unclear
exactly how SARS-CoV-2 affects humans. Thus, understanding the mechanism of SARS-CoV-2
actions should help develop therapeutic strategies to reduce the mortality and morbidity
associated with COVID-19.
The SARS-CoV-2 spike protein is critical to initiate the interactions between the virus
and the host cell surface receptor and facilitates the viral entry into the host cell by assisting in
the fusion of the viral and host cell membranes [11,12]. This protein consists of two subunits:
Subunit 1 (S1) that contains the ACE2 receptor-binding domain (RBD) and Subunit 2 (S2) that is
responsible for fusion.

The current dogma of the SARS-CoV-2 mechanism is that the binding of viral spike
protein to the host ACE2 receptor results in the entry of virus into the host cells and the cellular
response is a result of the viral infection [5,6,11,12]. However, we herein show that SARS-CoV2 spike protein alone without the rest of the viral components is sufficient to elicit cell signaling
in human host cells, suggesting a novel biological mechanism of SARS-CoV-2 actions.

2. Materials and Methods
2.1 Cell culture
Human pulmonary artery smooth muscle cells and human pulmonary artery endothelial
cells were purchased from ScienCell Research Laboratories (Carlsbad, CA, USA), and rat
pulmonary artery smooth muscle cells were purchased from Cell Applications (San Diego, CA,
USA). Cells were cultured in accordance with the manufacturers’ instructions in 5% CO2 at
37°C. Cells at passages 3-6 were maintained in low fetal bovine serum (0.4%)-containing
medium overnight before the treatment as routinely performed in experiments on cell signaling
and protein phosphorylation [13].
Cells were treated with the recombinant SARS-CoV-2 spike protein full length S1
subunit that contains most of the S1 subunit (Val16 - Gln690) with a molecular weight of 75
kDa (RayBiotech, Peachtree Corners, GA, USA) or the recombinant SARS-CoV-2 spike protein
RBD (RayBiotech) that only contains the RBD region (Arg319 - Phe541) with a molecular
weight of 25 kDa. Some cells were pretreated for 1 h with the rabbit anti-ACE2 antibody
(Catalog # 4355; Cell Signaling Technology, Danvers, MA).

2.2 Western blotting
To prepare cell lysates, cells were washed in phosphate buffered saline and solubilized
with lysis buffer containing 50 mM Hepes (pH 7.4), 1% (v/v) Triton X-100, 4 mM EDTA, 1 mM
sodium fluoride, 0.1 mM sodium orthovanadate, 1 mM tetrasodium pyrophosphate, 2 mM
PMSF, 10 µg/ml leupeptin, and 10 µg/ml aprotinin. Samples were then centrifuged at 16,000g
for 10 min at 4˚C, supernatants collected, and protein concentrations determined [13].
Equal amounts of protein samples were electrophoresed through a reducing sodium
dodecyl sulfate polyacrylamide gel. Proteins were then electro-transferred to the Immobilon-FL
Transfer Membrane (MilliporeSigma, Burlington, MA, USA). The membrane was blocked with
Odyssey blocking buffer (LI-COR, Lincoln, NE, USA) for one hour at 25°C and incubated
overnight with the rabbit anti-phospho-MEK1/2 (Ser217/221) antibody (Catalog #9154; Cell
Signaling), the mouse anti-MEK1/2 antibody (Catalog #4694; Cell Signaling), the rabbit antiphospho-Akt (Ser473) antibody (Catalog #9271; Cell Signaling), or the rabbit anti-phosphoStat3 (Tyr705) antibody (Catalog #9131; Cell Signaling) at 4°C. Washed membranes were then
incubated with IRDye 680RD or IRDye 800CW (LI-COR) for one hour. Signals were obtained
by using the Odyssey Infrared Imaging System (LI-COR).

2.3 Histological examinations of patient samples
Postmortem lung tissues were collected from 10 patients who died of COVID-19 in
Ukraine during the period of March - July, 2020. For comparison, we used the archival materials
of lung tissues from 10 patients who died of influenza A (H1N1) during the epidemic in
November and December of 2009. Clinical studies were approved by the regional committee for

medical research ethics in Kiev, Ukraine and performed under the Helsinki Declaration of 1975
revised in 2013 or comparable ethical standards.
For histological examinations, samples of autopsy materials approximately 10 mm thick
were fixed overnight in 10% buffered formalin at room temperature. Fixed tissues were
embedded in paraffin. From paraffin blocks, 5 μm thick sections were made using a microtome.
The sections were stained with hematoxylin and eosin. Histological specimens were examined
using a Leica BX 51 microscope, a Leica MC 190 digital camera, and the Leica LAS software at
magnifications of 100x – 200x. Morphometric investigations included the assessment of
pulmonary arterial wall thickness and pulmonary arterial lumen index (the ratio of internal vessel
area to external vessel area) using the ImageJ software. Seven vessels analyzed for each patient.

2.4 Statistical Analysis
For Western blotting data, means and standard errors of mean (SEM) were computed.
Two groups were compared by a two-tailed Student’s t test, and differences between more than
two groups were determined by the analysis of variance (ANOVA). p < 0.05 was defined to be
statistically significant. For the morphometric analysis, IBM SPSS Statistics software version
22.0 was used for the statistical calculations. Mann-Whitney U Test was used to define the
statistical significance at p < 0.05.

3. Results
3.1 SARS-CoV-2 spike protein alone can activate cell signaling in human cells
To test the hypothesis that SARS-CoV-2 spike protein alone can elicit cell signaling,
human pulmonary artery smooth muscle cells were treated with the full length S1 subunit (Val16
- Gln690) of the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein for 0, 10, and 30 min. As shown in Fig. 1A, the
spike protein at a concentration of 10 ng/ml (0.133 nM) strongly activated the phosphorylation of
45 kDa MEK at Ser217 and Ser221 residues. The kinetics of MEK phosphorylation promoted by
the full-length S1 subunit (Val16 - Gln690) of the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein was consistently
found to be transient with a peak at 10 min. This fast activation suggests that this may be a
receptor-mediated cell-signaling event. Similarly, full-length S1 subunit SARS-CoV-2 spike
protein promoted the phosphorylation of MEK in human pulmonary artery endothelial cells (Fig.
1B). SARS-CoV-2 spike protein, however, did not activate other signaling events such as Akt
(Fig. 1A) and Stat3 (Fig. 1B) pathways.
As we performed experiments to determine the effects of the full-length S1 subunit of
SARS-CoV-2 spike protein on rat pulmonary artery smooth muscle cells, we surprisingly found
that, not only SARS-CoV-2 spike protein did not promote the MEK phosphorylation, but rather
decreased the phosphorylation. As shown in Fig. 2, the treatment of full length SARS-CoV-2
spike protein S1 resulted in the dephosphorylation of MEK as early as 10 min after the treatment
and this dephosphorylation event was maintained for at least 60 min. Thus, SARS-CoV-2 spike
protein promotes the MEK phosphorylation in human cells, but not in rat cells.
To confirm that the action of SARS-CoV-2 spike protein is through its well-known
receptor ACE2,5,6 human pulmonary artery smooth muscle cells were pretreated with the ACE2
antibody for 1 hour before treating with the full-length S1 subunit of SARS-CoV-2 spike protein.

The ACE2 antibody alone caused the activation of MEK, and SARS-CoV-2 spike protein did not
further increase this MEK phosphorylation signal (Fig. 3).

3.2 RBD domain alone is not sufficient to activate cell signaling
To test whether the RBD binding to ACE2 is sufficient to stimulate cell signaling for
MEK phosphorylation, human cells were treated with the recombinant S1 RBD of SARS-CoV-2
spike protein that only contains the RBD (Arg319 - Phe541). In contrast to the full-length S1
subunit (Val16 - Gln690) that strongly phosphorylated MEK, S1 RBD (Arg319 - Phe541) did
not activate the MEK phosphorylation in human pulmonary artery smooth muscle cells (Fig. 4A)
or in human pulmonary artery endothelial cells (Fig. 4B). Thus, other regions of the spike protein
in addition to RBD may be required for eliciting cell signaling for MEK phosphorylation.

3.3 Pulmonary vascular walls are thickened in COVID-19 patients
Our results showing that SARS-CoV-2 spike protein is capable of activating the
MEK/ERK pathway in pulmonary artery smooth muscle and endothelial cells suggest that cell
growth signaling may be triggered in the pulmonary vascular walls in response to SARS-CoV-2.
To test this, we examined the lung histology results of patients who died of COVID-19.
Fig. 5A shows the representative pulmonary vessels of patients who died of COVID-19.
These pulmonary arteries consistently exhibit histological characteristics of vascular wall
thickening. The walls of the pulmonary arteries are thickened mainly due to the hypertrophy of
the tunica media. The vessels have lost the clarity of the boundaries with the surrounding lung
parenchyma. The enlargement of smooth muscle cells of the middle lining of the arteries is

observed. The nuclei of smooth muscle cells also are swollen, increased in size, have become
rounded, and vacuoles are identified in the cytoplasm.
By contrast, pulmonary vessels of patients who died of H1N1 influenza infection showed
that there were no occurrences of thickened pulmonary arteries (Fig. 5A). Unlike COVID 19,
smooth muscle cells form a compact layer of tunica media. There are no signs of the enlargement
of smooth muscle cells.
We performed a morphometric analysis of the pulmonary vessels of patients who died of
SARS-CoV-2 and H1N1 influenza virus. The median wall thickness value of the pulmonary
arteries of COVID-19 patients was calculated to be 15.4 μm, while that of patients with H1N1
influenza was 6.7 μm (Fig. 5B, left), indicating that pulmonary arterial walls are thicker in
COVID-19 patients more than 2-fold compared to influenza patients. These two values are
significantly different from each other with p = 0.001. The pulmonary arterial lumen area was
found to be significantly smaller in COVID-19 patients compared to influenza patients with p =
0.001 (Fig. 5B, right).

4. Discussion
The major finding of this study is that the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein without the rest of
the virus can elicit cell signaling, specifically the activation of the MEK/ERK pathway, in human
host lung vascular smooth muscle and endothelial cells. MEK is a mitogen-activated protein
kinase kinase (MAPKK) that phosphorylates and activates extracellular-regulated kinase (ERK),
one type of mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPK). In this MEK/ERK pathway of cell
signaling, MEK is activated by the phosphorylation by Raf1 kinase [14]. The MEK/ERK

pathway is a well-known cell growth mechanism [15] and has also been shown to facilitate the
viral replication cycles [16].
By contrast to the full-length S1 subunit of SARS-CoV-2 spike protein (Val16 - Gln690)
that strongly activated MEK, RBD only containing protein (Arg319 - Phe541) did not activate
MEK in human pulmonary artery smooth muscle or in endothelial cells. These results suggest
that the protein regions other than the RBD (i.e. Val16 - Arg319 and/or Phe541 - Gln690) are
required for eliciting cell signaling for the MEK phosphorylation. Thus, we propose that SARSCoV-2 spike protein-mediated cell signaling is not merely cells responding to anything binding
to the membrane surface protein, but is a growth factor/hormone-like specific cell signal
transduction event that is well coordinated by the RBD as well as other protein regions that
facilitate cell signaling. Our ACE2 antibody experiments as described in Fig. 3 support the
involvement of ACE2. However, the binding of the ACE2 antibody to ACE2 seems sufficient to
cause the activation of MEK. While we interpreted that the ACE2 antibody blocked and
interfered with the binding of the RBD to ACE2, it is possible that ACE2 antibody-mediated cell
signaling may have desensitized the subsequent spike protein-mediated effects to activate MEK.
Thus, SARS-CoV-2 spike protein-mediated cell signaling may occur through a receptor other
than ACE2.
In contrast to the effects of SARS-CoV-2 spike protein on human cells to activate the
MEK phosphorylation, this protein promoted the dephosphorylation of MEK in rat cells. This
species difference in the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein actions may be important to understand how
this virus severely affects humans. We previously reported a novel ligand-mediated
dephosphorylation mechanism of MEK induced by neurotensin and neuromedin N [17]. The
SARS-CoV-2 spike protein signaling in rat pulmonary artery smooth muscle cells represents

11

another example of the MEK dephosphorylation mechanism. These results also suggest that the
species-specific actions of SARS-CoV-2 may depend on how spike protein-mediated cell
signaling mechanisms differ among species.
It has been noted that elderly patients with systemic hypertension and other
cardiovascular diseases are particularly susceptible to developing severe and possibly fatal
conditions of COVID-19 [4,9,10]. Thus, the pathology of COVID-19 does not seem to be
explained merely by the action of SARS-CoV-2 to enter the host cells for destruction. The
present study shows that cell growth signaling may be triggered by this virus in both cultured
cells and in COVID-19 patient samples. We propose that SARS-CoV-2 spike protein-mediated
cell signaling promotes the hyperplasia and/or hypertrophy of vascular smooth muscle and
endothelial cells, contributing to the complex cardiovascular outcomes in COVID-19. Further
studies investigating this concept are warranted in order to develop effective therapeutic
strategies to reduce the mortality associated with COVID-19.
Our histology results showing that COVID-19 patients have thickened pulmonary arterial
walls also have clinical significance. These changes may reflect the tissue responses of the lungs
to hypoxia and may play a vital role in the development of acute respiratory failure in COVID-19
patients. These results also indicate the possibility that patients who recovered from COVID-19
may be predisposed to developing pulmonary arterial hypertension and right-sided heart failure.
We also noticed that published lung histology images of patients who died of ARDS during the
2002 - 2004 SARS outbreak due to the infection with SARS-CoV-1 did not exhibit the signs of
thickened pulmonary vascular walls [18,19]. Thus, pulmonary vascular wall thickening is a
unique feature of the SARS-CoV-2 infection and COVID-19.

5. Conclusions
Our results in human pulmonary artery smooth muscle and endothelial cells revealed that
the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein S1 subunit is sufficient to trigger biological responses in the
human host cells in the absence of the participation of the rest of the SARS-CoV-2 viral particle.
We also found that the pulmonary vascular walls are thickened in COVID-19 patients. We
propose that SARS-CoV-2 spike protein-mediated cell growth signaling participates in adverse
cardiovascular/pulmonary outcomes seen in COVID-19. This mechanism may provide new
therapeutic targets to combat the SARS-CoV-2 infection and COVID-19.
