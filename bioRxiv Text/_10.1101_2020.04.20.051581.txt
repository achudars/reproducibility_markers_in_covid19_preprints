A novel coronavirus SARS-CoV-2, also called novel coronavirus 2019 (nCoV-19), started to
circulate among humans around December 2019, and it is now widespread as a global pandemic.
The disease caused by SARS-CoV-2 virus is called COVID-19, which is highly contagious and
has an overall mortality rate of 6.96% as of May 4, 2020. There is no vaccine or antiviral
available for SARS-CoV-2. In this study, we report our discovery of inhibitors targeting the
SARS-CoV-2 main protease (Mpro). Using the FRET-based enzymatic assay, several inhibitors
including boceprevir, GC-376, and calpain inhibitors II, and XII were identified to have potent
activity with single-digit to submicromolar IC50 values in the enzymatic assay. The mechanism
of action of the hits was further characterized using enzyme kinetic studies, thermal shift binding
assays, and native mass spectrometry. Significantly, four compounds (boceprevir, GC-376,
calpain inhibitors II and XII) inhibit SARS-CoV-2 viral replication in cell culture with EC50
values ranging from 0.49 to 3.37 µM. Notably, boceprevir, calpain inhibitors II and XII represent
novel chemotypes that are distinct from known M pro inhibitors. A complex crystal structure of
SARS-CoV-2 Mpro with GC-376, determined at 2.15 Å resolution with three monomers per
asymmetric unit, revealed two unique binding configurations, shedding light on the molecular
interactions and protein conformational flexibility underlying substrate and inhibitor binding by
Mpro. Overall, the compounds identified herein provide promising starting points for the further
development of SARS-CoV-2 therapeutics.

INTRODUCTION
An emerging respiratory disease COVID-19 started to circulate among human in December
2019. Since its first outbreak in China from an unknown origin, it quickly became a global
pandemic. As of May 4, 2020, there are 239,740 deaths among 3,442,234 confirmed cases in 215
countries.1 The etiological pathogen of COVID-19 is a new coronavirus, the severe acute
respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), also called novel coronavirus (nCoV-2019).
As the name indicates, SARS-CoV-2 is similar to SARS, the virus that causes severe respiratory
symptoms in human and killed 774 people among 8098 infected worldwide in 2003. 2 SARSCoV-2 shares ~82% of sequence identity as SARS and to a less extent for Middle East
respiratory syndrome (MERS) (~50%).3, 4 SARS-CoV-2 is an enveloped, positive-sense, singlestranded RNA virus that belongs to the β-lineage of the coronavirus.5 The β-lineage also contains
two other important human pathogens, the SARS coronavirus and MERS coronavirus. The
mortality rate of SARS-CoV-2 is around 6.96% as of May 4, 2020, which is lower than that of
SARS (~10%) and MERS (~34%).2 However, current data indicate that SARS-CoV-2 is more
contagious and has a larger R0 value than SARS and MERS,6 resulting in higher overall death
tolls than SARS and MERS. The SARS-CoV-2 virus is currently spreading at an alarming speed
in Europe and the United States.
There is currently no antiviral or vaccine for SARS-CoV-2. The SARS-CoV-2 viral genome
encodes a number of structural proteins (e.g. capsid spike glycoprotein), non-structural proteins
(e.g. 3-chymotrypsin-like protease (3CL or main protease), papain-like protease, helicase, and
RNA-dependent RNA polymerase), and accessary proteins. Compounds that target anyone of
these viral proteins might be potential antiviral drug candidates. 7, 8 In this study, we focus on the
viral 3CL protease, also called the main protease (Mpro), and aim to develop potent Mpro

inhibitors as SAR-CoV-2 antivirals. The Mpro plays an essential role in coronavirus replication
by digesting the viral polyproteins at more than 11 sites, and it appears like a high profile target
for antiviral drug discovery.9-12 The Mpro has an unique substrate preference for glutamine at the
P1 site (Leu-Gln(Ser,Ala,Gly)), a feature that is absent in closely related host proteases,
suggesting it is feasible to achieve high selectivity by targeting viral Mpro. As such, we
developed the Fluorescence Resonance Energy Transfer (FRET)-based enzymatic assay for the
SARS-CoV-2 Mpro and applied it to screen a focused library of protease inhibitors. Here we
report our findings of several novel hits targeting SARS-CoV-2 Mpro and their mechanism of
action. The in vitro antiviral activity of the hits was also evaluated in cell culture using infectious
SARS-CoV-2 virus. Overall, our study provides a list of drug candidates for SARS-CoV-2 with a
confirmed mechanism of action, and the results might help speed up the drug discovery efforts in
combating COVID-19. The compounds identified herein represent one of the most potent and
selective SARS-CoV-2 Mpro inhibitors so far with both enzymatic inhibition and cellular antiviral
activity.9, 11, 12 The X-ray crystal structure of SARS-CoV-2 Mpro with GC-376 showed that the
compound can adapt two configurations R and S, offering a molecular explanation of the highbinding affinity of the aldehyde-containing inhibitors. Significantly, the discovery of calpain II
and XII inhibitors as potent SARS-CoV-2 antivirals suggest that it might be feasible to design
dual inhibitors against the viral Mpro and the host calpains, both of which are important for viral
replication.

RESULTS
Establishing the FRET-based assay for the SARS-CoV-2 main protease (Mpro)

The Mpro gene from SARS-CoV-2 strain BetaCoV/Wuhan/WIV04/2019 was inserted into
pET-29a(+) vector and expressed in BL21(DE3) E. Coli. with a His-tag in its C-terminus. The
Mpro protein was purified with Ni-NTA column to high purity (Fig. 1A). To establish the FRET
assay condition, we designed a FRET based substrate using the sequence between viral
polypeptide NSP4-NSP5 junction from SARS-CoV-2: Dabcyl-KTSAVLQ/SGFRKME(Edans).
We then tested the Mpro proteolytic activity in buffers with different pH. We found that Mpro
displays highest activity in pH 6.5 buffer (Fig. 1B), which contains 20 mM HEPES, 120 mM NaCl,
0.4 mM EDTA, and 4 mM DTT and 20% glycerol. As such, all the following proteolytic assay
was conducted using this pH 6.5 buffer. Next, we characterized the enzymatic activity of this
SARS-CoV-2 Mpro by measuring the Km and Vmax values. When 100 nM Mpro was mixed with
various concentration of FRET substrate (0 to 200 µM), the initial velocity was measured and
plotted against substrate concentration. Curve fitting with Michaelis-Menton equation gave the
best-fit values of Km and Vmax as 32.8 ± 3.5 µM and 29.4 ± 1.1 RFU/s, respectively (Fig. 1C).

100 nM His-tagged- Mpro with the various concentrations of FRET substrate in pH 6.5 reaction
buffer.
Primary screening of a focused protease library against the SARS-CoV-2 Mpro.
With the established FRET assay condition, we screened a collection of protease inhibitors
from the Selleckchem bioactive compound library to identify potential SARS-CoV-2 Mpro
inhibitors. The protease inhibitors are grouped based on their targets and mechanism of action and
include proteasome inhibitors (1-8); HIV protease inhibitors (9-14); γ-secretase inhibitors (15-22);
HCV NS3-4A protease inhibitors (23-29); DPP-4 inhibitors (30-35); miscellaneous serine protease
inhibitors (36-39); cathepsin and calpain protease inhibitors (40-43); miscellaneous cysteine
protease inhibitors (44-48); matrix metalloprotease inhibitors (49-51); and miscellaneous protease
inhibitors (52-55). The inhibitors were pre-incubated with 100 nM of Mpro at 30 °C for 30 minutes
in the presence of 4 mM 1,4-dithiothreitol (DTT) before the addition of 10 µM FRET substrate.
The addition of DTT was to quench non-specific thiol reactive compounds and to ensure the Mpro
is in the reducing condition. All compounds were tested at 20 µM, except compound 26, which
was tested at 2 µM due to its fluorescent background. Encouragingly, four inhibitors (24, 28, 29
and 43) showed more than 60% inhibition against Mpro at 20 µM. Among the hits, simeprevir (24),
boceprevir (28), and narlaprevir (29) are HCV NS3-4A serine protease inhibitors, and compound
MG-132 (43) inhibits both proteasome and calpain.

Figure 2: Screening of known protease inhibitors against SARS-CoV-2 Mpro using the
FRET assay. 20 µM of compounds (26 was tested at 2 µM) was pre-incubated with 100 nM of
SARS-CoV-2 Mpro for 30 minutes at 30 °C, then 10 µM FRET substrate was added to reaction
mixture to initiate the reaction. The reaction was monitored for 2 hours. The initial velocity was
calculated by linear regression using the data points from the first 15 minutes of the reaction. The
calculated initial velocity with each compound was normalized to DMSO control. The results are
average ± standard deviation of two repeats.

Secondary screening of a focused library of calpain/cathepsin inhibitors and known viral
3CLpro inhibitors
Given the encouraging results from the primary screening, we then further characterized the
four hits (24, 28, 29, and 43) in a consortium of assays including dose-response titration, thermal
shift binding assay (TSA), and counter screening assays with two other viral cysteine proteases,
the enterovirus A71 (EV-A71) 2A and 3C proteases, both of which are cysteine proteases (Table
2). The HCV NS3-4A protease inhibitors boceprevir (28) and narlaprevir (29) inhibited Mpro with
IC50 values of 4.13 and 4.73 µM, respectively (Table 2), more potent than simeprevir (24) (IC50 =

13.74 µM). Both compounds 28 and 29 also showed strong binding towards Mpro and shifted the
melting temperature of the protein (ΔT m) by 6.67 and 5.18 oC, respectively, at 40 µM. Despite
their potent inhibition against the HCV NS3-4A serine protease and the SARS-CoV-2 cysteine
Mpro, boceprevir (28) and narlaprevir (29) did not inhibit the EV-A71 2A and 3C proteases (IC50 >
20 µM), suggesting they are not non-specific cysteine protease inhibitors. The calpain inhibitor
MG-132 (43) had an IC50 value of 3.90 µM against the Mpro, and was not active against the EVA71 2A and 3C proteases (IC50 > 20 µM). The binding of MG-132 (43) to Mpro was also confirmed
in the TSA assay with a ΔTm of 4.02 oC.
In light of the promising results of the calpain inhibitor MG-132 (43), we then pursued to
testing other calpain and cathepsin inhibitors that are commercially available (56-63) (Table 2).
These compounds were not included in the initial library because they have not been advanced to
clinical studies. Among this series of analogs, calpain inhibitor II (61) and XII (62) are the most
potent Mpro inhibitors with IC50 values of 0.97 and 0.45 µM, respectively. Binding of compounds
61 and 62 to Mpro shifted the melting curve of the protein by 6.65 and 7.86 oC, respectively.
Encouragingly, both compounds 61 and 62 did not inhibit the EV-A71 2A and 3C proteases (IC50 >
20 µM). Calpain inhibitor I (59) and MG-115 (60) also showed potent inhibition against Mpro with
IC50 values of 8.60 and 3.14 µM, respectively. Calpeptin (56) and PSI (63) had moderate activity
against Mpro with IC50 values of 10.69 and 10.38 µM, respectively. In contrast, calpain inhibitors
III (57) and VI (58) were not active (IC50 > 20 µM).
We also included two well-known viral 3CL protease inhibitors GC-376 (64) and rupintrivir
(65) in the secondary screening. GC-376 (64) is an investigational veterinary drug that is being
developed for feline infectious peritonitis (FIP). 13, 14 GC-376 (64) was designed to target the viral
3CL protease and had potent antiviral activity against multiple viruses including MERS, FIPV,

and norovirus.13, 15 Rupintrivir (65) was developed as a rhinovirus antiviral by targeting the viral
3CL protease, but it was discontinued in clinical trials due to side effects. 16 In our study, we
found that GC-376 (64) was the most potent Mpro inhibitor with an IC50 value of 0.03 µM. It
shifted the melting curve of Mpro by 18.30 oC upon binding. In contrast, rupintrivir (65) was not
active against Mpro (IC50 > 20 µM). Previous report also showed that rupintrivir was not active
against the SARS-CoV 3CLpro (Mpro) (IC50 > 100 µM).17 Both compounds 64 and 65 were not
active against the EV-A71 2A protease, but showed potent inhibition against the EV-A71 3C
protease, which is consistent with previously reported results. 15, 18, 19

b: N.T. = not tested;
c: The IC50 of PSI (64) on SARS CoV-2 Mpro was calculated by end point reading of 1 hour digestion,
instead of the initial velocity.

When plotting the IC50 values (log scale) of the inhibitors against Mpro from the FRET
enzymatic assay with the melting temperature shifts (ΔTm) from thermal shift binding assay (Fig.
3A), a linear correlation was observed, and the r2 of the linear regression fitting is 0.94. This
suggests that there is a direct correlation between the enzymatic inhibition and protein binding: a
more potent enzyme inhibitor also binds to the protein with higher affinity. The stabilization of the
Mpro against thermal denaturation was also compound concentration dependent (Fig. 3B).
The binding of four most potent inhibitors boceprevir (28), calpain inhibitors II (61), XII (62),
and GC-376 (64) to SARS-CoV-2 Mpro was further characterized by native mass spectrometry
(MS) (Figs. 3C-F). Native MS analysis showed that the Mpro formed a dimer complex with a mass
of 69,722 Da, indicating a cleaved N-terminal methionine (Fig. S1). A small amount of monomer
and dimer with a single C-terminal truncation of the His-tag was also observed, but the intact dimer
was the predominant signal (Fig. S1). Addition of all four ligands tested, boceprevir (28), calpain
inhibitors II (61), XII (62), and GC-376 (64), showed binding of up to two ligands per dimer (Fig.
3C-F), suggesting a binding stoichiometry of one drug per monomer.

Mechanism of action of hits
To elucidate the mechanism of action of hits against SARS-CoV-2 Mpro, we focus on five
most potent compounds prioritized from the primary and secondary screenings including
boceprevir (28), MG-132 (43), calpain inhibitor II (61), calpain inhibitor XII (62), and GC-376
(64). For this, we performed enzyme kinetic studies with different concentrations of inhibitors
(Fig. 4). A biphasic enzymatic progression curve in the presence but not in the absence of inhibitor
is typically a hallmark for a slow covalent binding inhibitor. In the Fig. 4, left column shows the
progression curves up to 4 hours. Biphasic progression curves were observed for all 5 inhibitors at
high drug concentrations. Significant substrate depletion was observed when the proteolytic
reaction proceeded beyond 90 minutes, we therefore chose the first 90 minutes of the progression
curves for curve fitting (Fig. 4 middle column). We fit the progression curves in the presence
different concentrations of GC-376 (64) with the two-step Morrison equation (equation 3 in
methods section). GC-376 (64) binds to SARS-CoV-2 Mpro with an equilibrium dissociation
constant for the inhibitor (KI) of 59.9 ± 21.7 nM in the first step. After initial binding, a slower
covalent bond is formed between GC-376 (64) and Mpro with the second reaction rate constant (k2)
being 0.00245 ± 0.00047 s-1, resulting an overall k2/KI value of 4.08 x 104 M-1 s-1 (Fig. 4A).
However, when we tried to fit the proteolytic progression curves for boceprevir (28), MG-132 (43),
calpain inhibitors II (61) and XII (62) using the same two-step reaction mechanism, we could not
obtain accurate values for the second rate constant k2. This is presumably due to significant
substrate depletion before the equilibrium between EI and EI*, leading to very small values of k2.

Cellular antiviral activity and cytotoxicity of hits
To test the hypothesis that inhibiting the enzymatic activity of Mpro will lead to the inhibition
of SARS-CoV-2 viral replication, we performed cellular antiviral assays for the five promising
hits 64, 28, 43, 61, and 62 against SARS-CoV-2. For this, we first tested the cellular cytotoxicity
of these compounds in multiple cell lines (Table S1). GC-376 (64), boceprevir (28), and calpain
inhibitor II (61) were well tolerated and had CC50 values of over 100 µM for all the cell lines tested.
MG-132 (43) was cytotoxic to all the cells with CC50 values less than 1 µM except A549 cells.
Calpain inhibitor XII (62) had acceptable cellular cytotoxicity with CC50 values above 50 µM for
all the cell lines tested (Table S1).
Next, we chose four compounds boceprevir (28), calpain inhibitors II (61), XII (62), and GC376 (64) for the antiviral assay with infectious SARS-CoV-2. MG-132 (43) was not included due
to its cytotoxicity. Gratifyingly, all four compounds showed potent antiviral activity against
SARS-CoV-2 in the primary viral cytopathic effect (CPE) assay with EC50 values ranging from
0.49 to 3.37 µM (Table 3). Their antiviral activity was further confirmed in the secondary viral
yield reduction (VYR) assay. The most potent compound was calpain inhibitor XII (62), which
showed EC50 of 0.49 µM in the primary CPE assay and EC90 of 0.45 µM in the secondary VYR
assay. In comparison, remdesivir was reported to inhibit SARS-CoV-2 in the VYR assay with an

EC50 of 0.77 µM.26 None of the compounds inhibited the unrelated influenza virus
A/California/07/2009 (H1N1) virus (EC50 > 20 µM) (Table S1), suggesting the antiviral activity
of the four compounds (boceprevir, calpain inhibitors II, XII, and GC-376) against SARS-CoV-2
is specific. In comparison with recently reported SARS-CoV-2 Mpro inhibitors (Table 3), the hits
identified herein represent one of the most potent and selective drug candidates with broad
chemical diversity.

Complex crystal structure of SARS-CoV-2 Mpro with GC-376 (64)
The crystal structure of the SARS-CoV-2 Mpro in complex with GC-376 (64) was solved in
the p3221 space group at 2.15 Å resolution (Table S2). There are three monomers per
asymmetric unit (ASU), with two constituting a biological dimer and the third forming a dimer
with a crystallographic symmetry related neighboring protomer (Fig. S2). The presence of three
monomers in our crystal structure allowed us to capture different binding configurations of GC376 (64) (Fig. 5), a unique feature that was not observed in previous X-ray crystal structures 9, 11,
12

. The pairwise r.m.s.d among the monomer backbone C atoms ranges from 0.435 Å to 0.564

Å. Previously, SARS-CoV Mpro and SARS-CoV-2 Mpro crystal structures have been solved most
frequently as a monomer per ASU, and occasionally a dimer 9, 11, 12, 28, 29. In its native state, Mpro
requires dimerization to become catalytically active 30, 31, which is supported by our native MS

data (Fig. S1). In our crystal structures, all three protomers appear catalytically competent, with
the third protomer activated by the N-finger from an adjacent asymmetric unit (Fig. S2B).

the three protomers in the asymmetric subunit of SARS-CoV-2 Mpro with GC-376 (64).
Significant conformational flexibility is observed, particularly in the TSEDMLN loop.

GC-376 (64) forms an extensive network of hydrogen bonds with the active site while also
exhibiting excellent geometric complementarity (Fig. 5). These interactions are coupled with the
thermodynamic payoff of covalent adduct formation between the aldehyde bisulfite warhead and
Cys145, making GC-376 (64) one of the most potent SARS-CoV-2 Mpro inhibitors in vitro with
an IC50 of 0.030 ± 0.008 µM (Table 3). Along with other known Mpro inhibitors N3, 13b, 11a
and 11b (Table 3), GC-376 (64) mimics the peptide substrate that is cleaved by this enzyme (Fig.
5E) 9, 27, 29, 32. The glutamine surrogate γ-lactam ring is a cyclized derivative of the P1 glutamine
side chain that normally occupies the S1 site; here it forms hydrogen bonds with the His163 and
Glu166 side chains and the main chain of Phe140 (Figs. 5A & C). An amide bond connects the
γ-lactam side chain to an isobutyl moiety that embeds itself in the hydrophobic S2 site formed by
His41, Met49, and Met169. Normally, this S2 site in SARS-CoV-2 Mpro can accommodate a
variety of hydrophobic substitutions such as isobutyl in GC-376 (64) and N3, cyclopropyl in
13b, cyclohexyl in 11a, and 3-fluorophenyl in 11b (Table 3) 33, 34. A carbamate bond in GC-376
(64), which forms hydrogen bonds with the main chain of Glu166 and the side chain of Gln189,
connects the P2 isobutyl group to a phenylmethyl ester that interacts with the aliphatic S4 site.
Compared with previous inhibitors, the phenylmethyl ester of GC-376 exhibits high
complementarity with the S4 site, and the extensive non-polar interactions may contribute
significantly to the potency of this compound (Fig. 5E).

Three copies of GC-376 (64) were found in the crystal structure, one in each protomer active
site (Figs. 5A, 5C, S3). The configurations of G-C376 (64) were consistent in protomers A and
B, where the thioacetal hydroxide is positioned in the “oxyanion hole” formed by the backbone
amides of Gly143, Ser144, and Cys145 (Figs. 5A & S3), resulting in the (S)-configuration. It is
noted that aldehydes 11a and 11b also bind in the active site of SARS-CoV-2 Mpro in the (S)configuration (PDB: 6M0K and 6LZE) (Figs. S4A).12 In protomer C, however, the same
hydroxide group orients outwards from the oxyanion hole, forming hydrogen bonds with His41
(Fig. 5C), which gives the (R)-configuration. This (R)-configuration is consistent with the
binding mode of α-ketoamide 13b in the active site of SARS-CoV-2 Mpro (PDB: 6Y2F) (Fig.
S4B).9 These two unique configurations R and S might be a result of the Cys145 thiol
nucleophilic attacking the aldehyde from two different faces (Figs. 5B & D). The fact that GC376 (64) can adapt two different configurations R and S upon binding to the active site might
explain its high binding affinity towards the target.
An additional difference between the configurations of GC-376 (64) in A, B and C is
observed in the orientation of the phenylmethyl ester. In protomer C, the CH2 of the
phenylmethyl points towards the main chain of Leu167 in a ‘cis’ conformation (Fig. 5C),
whereas in protomers A and B this same CH2 points downwards in a ‘trans’ conformation (Figs.
5A & S3). Consequently, this influences the rotameric configuration of the Leu167 isobutyl
moiety, where a rotational adjustment of 180˚ occurs at its “β” carbon. Furthermore, large
rearrangements are observed in the flexible TSEDMLN loop consisting of residues 45-51
(TAEDMLN in SARS-CoV-2 Mpro) that form the S2 and S3’ subsites (Fig. 5F), explaining the
broad substrate scope in the P2 site (Table 3). The loop conformations in protomers B and C may
be influenced by crystal packing interactions with protomers from adjacent asymmetric units and

resemble the conformations in previously determined structures 11, 12. Meanwhile, the
conformation of protomer A is less restrained and exhibits the most significant conformational
divergence. The different loop conformations offer a glimpse of the protein plasticity that
allows Mpro to accommodate peptides with differing amino acid composition, and underscores
the importance of considering this flexibility when analyzing and modeling protein-ligand
interactions for Mpro .

DISCUSSION
Coronaviruses have caused three epidemics/pandemics in the past twenty years including
SARS, MERS, and COVID-19. With the ongoing pandemic of COVID-19, scientists and
researchers around the globe are racing to find effective vaccines and antiviral drugs. 7 The viral
polymerase inhibitor remdesivir holds the greatest promise and it is currently being evaluated in
several clinical trials.35, 36 The HIV drug combination lopinavir and ritonavir recently failed in a
clinical trial for COVID-19 with no significant therapeutic efficacy was observed. 37 To address
this unmet medical need, we initiated a drug repurposing screening to identify potent inhibitors
against the SARS-CoV-2 Mpro from a collection of FDA-approved protease inhibitors. The Mpro
has been shown to be a validated antiviral drug target for SARS and MERS.38 As the SARSCoV-2 Mpro shares a high sequence similarity with SARS and to a less extent with MERS, we
reasoned that inhibiting the enzymatic activity of SARS-CoV-2 Mpro will similarly prevent viral
replication.9, 11
Noticeable findings from our study include: 1) Boceprevir (28), an FDA-approved HCV
drug, inhibits the enzymatic activity of Mpro with IC50 of 4.13 µM, and has an EC50 of 1.90 µM
against the SARS-CoV-2 virus in the cellular viral cytopathic effect assay. The therapeutic

potential of boceprevir (28) should be further evaluated in relevant animal models and human
clinic trials. Since boceprevir (28) is a FDA-approved drug, the dose, toxicity, formulation, and
pharmacokinetic properties are already known, which will greatly speed up the design of follow
up studies; 2) GC-376 (64), an investigational veterinary drug, showed promising antiviral
activity against the SARS-CoV-2 virus (EC50 = 3.37 µM ). It has the highest enzymatic
inhibition against the Mpro with an IC50 value of 0.03 µM. This compound has promising in vivo
efficacy in treating cats infected with FIP, and has favorable in vivo pharmacokinetic properties.
Therefore, GC-376 (64) is ready to be tested in relevant animal models of SARS-CoV-2 when
available. Importantly, the X-ray crystal structure of SARS-CoV-2 Mpro in complex with GC-376
(64) provides a molecular explanation of the high binding affinity of aldehyde-containing
compounds as they can adapt two configurations R and S. The conformational flexibility at the
TSEDMLN loop explains the broad substrate scope at the P2 position of Mpro inhibitors; 3)
Three calpain/cathepsin inhibitors, MG-132 (43), calpain inhibitors II (61) and XII (62), are
potent inhibitors of Mpro and inhibit SARS-CoV-2 with single-digit to submicromolar efficacy in
the enzymatic assay. Calpain inhibitors II (61) and XII (62) also inhibit SARS-CoV-2 in the CPE
assay with EC50 values of 2.07 and 0.49 µM, respectively. This result suggests that
calpain/cathepsin inhibitors are rich sources of drug candidates for SARS-CoV-2. Indeed,
previous studies have shown that calpain and cathepsin are required for the proteolytic
processing of the coronavirus S protein, a step that is essential for the viral fusion and genome
release during the early stage of viral replication. 39 Calpain and cathepsin inhibitors such as
MDL28170 (calpain inhibitor III)39, MG-13240, calpain inhibitor VI41 have been shown to inhibit
SARS-CoV replication in cell culture. Other than the increased potency of targeting both M pro
and calpain/cathepsin, an additional benefit of such dual inhibitors might be their high genetic

barrier to drug resistance. A significant number of calpain/cathepsin inhibitors have been
developed over the years for various diseases including cancer, neurodegeneration disease,
kidney diseases, and ischemia/reperfusion injury. 42 Given our promising results of calpain
inhibitors II (61) and XII (62) in inhibiting the SARS-CoV-2 Mpro and their potent antiviral
activity in cell culture, it might be worthwhile to repurposing them as antivirals for SARS-CoV2.
All potent SARS-CoV-2 Mpro inhibitors contain reactive warheads such as α-ketoamide
(boceprevir (28), calpain inhibitor XII (62)) or aldehyde (MG-132 (43), calpain inhibitor II (61))
or aldehyde prodrug, the bisulfite (GC-376 (64)). This result suggests that reactive warheads
might be essential for SARS-CoV-2 Mpro inhibition. The compounds identified in this study
represent one of the most potent and selective hits reported so far, and are superior than recently
reported SARS-CoV-2 Mpro inhibitors ebselen, N3, and 13b (Table 3). Calpain inhibitor XII (62)
had similar potency as the recently disclosed compounds 11a and 11b (Table 3).12 Notably,
calpain inhibitor II (61) and XII (62) have different chemical scaffolds as GC-376 (64), N3, 13b,
11a, and 11b, therefore providing new opportunities for designing more potent and selective
SARS-CoV-2 Mpro inhibitors.
Aside from the above positive results, we also showed that ritonavir (9) and lopinavir (10)
failed to inhibit the SARS-CoV-2 Mpro (IC50 > 20 µM, Fig. 2), which might explain their lack
efficacy in clinical trials for COVID-19.37 Camostat (39) was recently proposed to inhibit SARSCoV-2 entry through inhibiting the host TMPRSS2, a host serine protease that is important for
viral S protein priming.43 However, the antiviral activity of camostat has not been confirmed
with infectious SARS-CoV-2 virus. In our study, we found camostat (39) has no inhibition
against the SARS-CoV-2 Mpro (IC50 > 20 µM).

In summary, this study identified several potent SARS-CoV-2 Mpro inhibitors with potent
enzymatic inhibition as well as cellular antiviral activity. Further development based on these
hits might lead to clinically useful COVID-19 antivirals. They can be used either alone or in
combination with polymerase inhibitors such as remdesivir as a means to achieve potential
synergic antiviral effect as well as to suppress drug resistance.

MATERIALS AND METHODS
Cell lines and viruses. Human rhabdomyosarcoma (RD); A549, MDCK, Caco-2, and Vero cells
were maintained in Dulbecco’s modified Eagle’s medium (DMEM), BEAS2B and HCT-8 cells
were maintained in RPMI 1640 medium. Both medium was supplemented with 10% fetal bovine
serum (FBS) and 1% penicillin-streptomycin antibiotics. Cells were kept at 37°C in a 5% CO2
atmosphere. The USA_WA1/2020 strain of SARS-CoV-2 obtained from the World Reference Center for
Emerging Viruses and Arboviruses (WRCEVA).

Protein expression and purification. SARS CoV-2 main protease (Mpro or 3CL) gene from strain
BetaCoV/Wuhan/WIV04/2019 was ordered from GenScript (Piscataway, NJ) in the pET29a(+)
vector with E. coli codon optimization. pET29a(+) plasmids with SARS CoV-2 main protease was
transformed into competent E. coli BL21(DE3) cells, and a single colony was picked and used to
inoculate 10 ml of LB supplemented with 50 g/ml kanamycin at 37°C and 250 rpm. The 10-ml
inoculum was added to 1 liter of LB with 50 g/ml kanamycin and grown to an optical density at
600 nm of 0.8, then induced using 1.0 mM IPTG. Induced cultures were incubated at 37 °C for an
additional 3 h and then harvested, resuspended in lysis buffer (25 mM Tris [pH 7.5], 750 mM NaCl,
2 mM dithiothreitol [DTT] with 0.5 mg/ml lysozyme, 0.5 mM phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride
[PMSF], 0.02 mg/ml DNase I), and lysed with alternating sonication and French press cycles. The
cell debris were removed by centrifugation at 12,000 g for 45 min (20% amplitude, 1 s on/1 s off).
The supernatant was incubated with Ni-NTA resin for over 2 h at 4°C on a rotator. The Ni-NTA
resin was thoroughly washed with 30 mM imidazole in wash buffer (50 mM Tris [pH 7.0], 150
mM NaCl, 2 mM DTT); and eluted with 100 mM imidazole in 50 mM Tris [pH 7.0], 150 mM
NaCl, 2 mM DTT. The imidazole was removed via dialysis or on a 10,000-molecular-weight-

KTSAVLQ/SGFRKME(Edans) was synthesized by solid-phase synthesis through iterative cycles
of coupling and deprotection using the previously optimized procedure.(4) Specifically,
chemmatrix rink-amide resin was used. Typical coupling condition was 5 equiv of amino acid, 5
equiv of HATU, and 10 equiv of DIEA in DMF for 5 minutes at 80 oC. For deprotection, 5%
piperazine plus 0.1 M HOBt were used and the mixture was heated at 80oC for 5 minutes. The
peptide was cleaved from the resin using 95% TFA, 2.5% Tris, 2.5% H2O and the crude peptide
was precipitated from ether after removal of TFA. The final peptide was purified by preparative
HPLC. The purify and identify of the peptide were confirmed by analytical HPLC (> 98% purity)
and mass spectrometry. [M+3]3+ calculated 694.15, detected 694.90; [M+4]4+ calculated 520.86,
detected 521.35;
Native Mass Spectrometry. Prior to analysis, the protein was buffer exchanged into 0.2 M
ammonium acetate (pH 6.8) and diluted to 10 μM. DTT was dissolved in water and prepared at a
400 mM stock. Each ligand was dissolved in ethanol and diluted to 10X stock concentrations.
The final mixture was prepared by adding 4 μL protein, 0.5 μL DTT stock, and 0.5 μL ligand
stock for final concentration of 4 mM DTT and 8 μM protein. Final ligand concentrations were
used as annotated. The mixtures were then incubated for 10 minutes at room temperature prior
to analysis. Each sample was mixed and analyzed in triplicate.
Native mass spectrometry (MS) was performed using a Q-Exactive HF quadrupole-Orbitrap
mass spectrometer with the Ultra-High Mass Range research modifications (Thermo Fisher

Scientific). Samples were ionized using nano-electrospray ionization in positive ion mode using
1.0 kV capillary voltage at a 150 °C capillary temperature. The samples were all analyzed with a
1,000–25,000 m/z range, the resolution set to 30,000, and a trapping gas pressure set to 3.
Between 10 and 50 V of source fragmentation was applied to all samples to aid in desolvation.
Data were deconvolved and analyzed with UniDec.(5)
Enzymatic assays. For reaction condition optimization, 200 µM SARS CoV-2 Main protease was
used. pH6.0 buffer contains 20 mM MES pH6.0, 120 mM NaCl, 0.4 mM EDTA, 4 mM DTT and
20% glycerol; pH6.5 buffer contains 20 mM HEPES pH6.5, 120 mM NaCl, 0.4 mM EDTA, 4 mM
DTT and 20% glycerol, pH7.0 buffer contains 20 mM HEPES pH7.0, 120 mM NaCl, 0.4 mM
EDTA, 4 mM DTT and 20% glycerol. Upon addition of 20 µM FRET substrate, the reaction
progress was monitored for 1 hr. The first 15 min of reaction was used to calculate initial velocity
(Vi) via linear regression in prism 5. Main protease displays highest proteolytic activity in pH6.5
buffer. All the following enzymatic assays were carried in pH6.5 buffer.
For the measurements of Km/Vmax, screening the protease inhibitor library, as well as IC50
measurements, proteolytic reaction with 100 nM Main protease in 100 µl pH6.5 reaction buffer
was carried out at 30 °C in a Cytation 5 imaging reader (Thermo Fisher Scientific) with filters for
excitation at 360/40 nm and emission at 460/40 nm. Reactions were monitored every 90 s. For
Km/Vmax measurements, a FRET substrate concentration ranging from 0 to 200 µM was applied.
The initial velocity of the proteolytic activity was calculated by linear regression for the first 15
min of the kinetic progress curves. The initial velocity was plotted against the FRET concentration
with the classic Michaelis-Menten equation in Prism 5 software. For the screening protease
inhibitor library and IC50 measurements, 100 nM Main protease was incubated with protease
inhibitor at 30°C for 30 min in reaction buffer, and then the reaction was initiated by adding 10

µM FRET substrate, the reaction was monitored for 1 h, and the initial velocity was calculated for
the first 15 min by linear regression. The IC50 was calculated by plotting the initial velocity against
various concentrations of protease inhibitors by use of a dose-response curve in Prism 5 software.
Proteolytic reaction progress curve kinetics measurements with GC376, MG132, Boceprevir,
Calpain inhibitor II, and Calpain inhibitor XII used for curve fitting, were carried out as follows:
5 nM Main protease protein was added to 20 µM FRET substrate with various concentrations of
testing inhibitor in 200 µl of reaction buffer at 30 °C to initiate the proteolytic reaction. The
reaction was monitored for 4 hrs. The progress curves were fit to a slow binding Morrison equation
(equation 3) as described previously (1, 6):

(1)
KI = k-1/k1

(2)

P(t) = P0 + Vs t - (Vs - V0) (1 - e-kt)/k

k = k2[I]/(KI + [I])

where P(t) is the fluorescence signal at time t, P 0 is the background signal at time zero, V0, Vs,
and and k represent, respectively, the initial velocity, the final steady-state velocity and the
apparent first-order rate constant for the establishment of the equilibrium between EI and EI*
(6). k2/KI is commonly used to evaluate the efficacy for covalent inhibitor. We observed
substrate depletion when proteolytic reactions progress longer than 90 min, therefore only first
90 min of the progress curves were used in the curve fitting (Figure 6 middle column). In this
study, we could not accurately determine the k2 for the protease inhibitors: Calpain inhibitor II,
MG132, Boceprevir, and Calpain inhibitor XII, due to the very slow k 2 in these case: significant
substrate depletion before the establishment of the equilibrium between EI and EI*. In these

cases, KI was determined with Morrison equation in Prism 5.
Differential scanning fluorimetry (DSF). The binding of protease inhibitors on Main protease
protein was monitored by differential scanning fluorimetry (DSF) using a Thermal Fisher
QuantStudioTM 5 Real-Time PCR System. TSA plates were prepared by mixing Main protease
protein (final concentration of 3 μM) with inhibitors, and incubated at 30 °C for 30 min. 1× SYPRO
orange (Thermal Fisher) were added and the fluorescence of the plates were taken under a
temperature gradient ranging from 20 to 90 °C (incremental steps of 0.05 °C/s). The melting
temperature (Tm) was calculated as the mid-log of the transition phase from the native to the
denatured protein using a Boltzmann model (Protein Thermal Shift Software v1.3). Thermal shift
which was represented as ΔTm was calculated by subtracting reference melting temperature of
proteins in DMSO from the Tm in the presence of compound.
Cytotoxicity measurement. A549, MDCK, HCT-8, Caco-2, Vero, and BEAS2B cells for
cytotoxicity CPE assays were seeded and grown overnight at 37 °C in a 5% CO2 atmosphere to
∼90% confluence on the next day. Cells were washed with PBS buffer and 200 µl DMEM with
2% FBS and 1% penicillin−streptomycin, and various concentration of protease inhibitors was
added to each well. 48 hrs after addition the protease inhibitors, cells were stained with 66 μg/ mL
neutral red for 2 h, and neutral red uptake was measured at an absorbance at 540 nm using a
Multiskan FC microplate photometer (Thermo Fisher Scientific). The CC 50 values were calculated
from best-fit dose−response curves using GraphPad Prism 5 software.
SARS-CoV-2 CPE assay. Antiviral activities of test compounds were determined in nearly
confluent cultures of Vero 76 cells. The assays were performed in 96-well Corning microplates.
Cells were infected with approximately 60 cell culture infectious doses (CCID 50) of SARS-CoV2 and 50% effective concentrations (EC50) were calculated based on virus-induced cytopathic

effects (CPE) quantified by neutral red dye uptake after 5 days of incubation. Three microwells
at each concentration of compound were infected. Two uninfected microwells served as toxicity
controls. Cells were stained for viability for 2 h with neutral red (0.11% final
concentration). Excess dye was rinsed from the cells with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS). The
absorbed dye was eluted from the cells with 0.1 ml of 50% Sörensen’s citrate buffer (pH 4.2)50% ethanol. Plates were read for optical density determination at 540 nm. Readings were
converted to the percentage of the results for the uninfected control using an Excel spreadsheet
developed for this purpose. EC50 values were determined by plotting percent CPE versus log 10
inhibitor concentration. Toxicity at each concentration was determined in uninfected wells in the
same microplates by measuring dye uptake.

SARS-CoV-2 VYR assay. Virus yield reduction (VYR) assays were conducted by first
replicating the viruses in the presence of test compound. Supernatant was harvested 3 days postinfection from each concentration of test compound and the virus yield was determined by
endpoint dilution method. Briefly, supernatant virus was serially diluted in log10 increments then
plated onto quadruplicate wells of 96-well plates seeded with Vero 76 cells. The presence or
absence of CPE for determining a viral endpoint was evaluated by microscopic examination of
cells 6 days after infection. From these data, 90% virus inhibitory concentrations (EC 90) were
determined by regression analysis.

day in protein buffer (50 mM Tris pH 7.0, 150 mM NaCl, 4 mM DTT). Since GC3760 is water
soluble, no precipitation was observed, and centrifugation was not necessary. Crystals were grown
by mixing 2 uL of the protein solution with 1 ul of the precipitant solution (15 % PEG 2K, 10%
1,6-hexanediol, and 0.2 M NaCl) in a hanging-drop vapor-diffusion apparatus. Crystals were
cryoprotected by transferring to a cryoprotectant solution (20% PEG 2K, 10% 1,6-hexanediol, 20%
glycerol) and flash-frozen in liquid nitrogen.
X-ray diffraction data for the SARS-CoV2-Mpro GC376 complex structure was collected on the
SBC 19-ID beamline at the Advanced Photon Source (APS) in Argonne, IL, and processed with
the HKL3000 software suite(8). The CCP4 versions of MOLREP were used for molecular
replacement using a previously solved SARS-CoV-2 Mpro (PDB ID 5RGG) as a reference
model(9). Rigid and restrained refinements were performed using REFMAC and model building
with COOT(10, 11). Protein structure figures were made using PyMOL (Schrödinger, LLC).
