Abstract

40

similar to severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). Designing

41

immunogens that elicit broadly neutralizing antibodies to conserved viral epitopes on the major

42

surface glycoprotein, spike, such as the receptor binding domain (RBD) is one potential approach.

43

Here, we report the generation of homotrimeric RBD immunogens from different sarbecoviruses

44

using a stabilized, immune-silent trimerization tag. We find that that a cocktail of homotrimeric

45

sarbecovirus RBDs can elicit a neutralizing response to all components even in context of prior

46

SARS-CoV-2 imprinting. Importantly, the cross-neutralizing antibody responses are focused

47

towards conserved RBD epitopes outside of the ACE-2 receptor-binding motif. This may be an

48

effective strategy for eliciting broadly neutralizing responses leading to a pan-sarbecovirus

49

vaccine.

Effective countermeasures are needed against emerging coronaviruses of pandemic potential,

Main Text

58

the subsequent global pandemic has highlighted the disruptive threat posed by viruses for which

59

humans have no prior immunity. Rapid development of potential vaccines has led to an

60

unprecedented 13 candidates already in Phase 3 clinical trials in the last 6 months; while differing

61

in modality (e.g., mRNA, adenovirus), the primary immunogen for many of these candidates is

62

the SARS-CoV-2 spike ectodomain (1). With the continued global spread of SARS-CoV-2, in

63

conjunction with potential vaccinations, it is likely that a large proportion of the global population

64

will eventually develop an immune response to SARS-CoV-2. However, even after potentially

65

achieving herd immunity sufficient to slow the spread of SARS-CoV-2, there remains a constant

66

threat of emerging coronaviruses with pandemic potential. Indeed, surveillance efforts have

67

identified numerous unique coronaviruses within various animal reservoirs, raising the possibility

68

of zoonotic transmission (2, 3). Such events are likely to increase in frequency as a result of human

69

impact on the environment (4). While the current SARS-CoV-2 pandemic has an estimated

70

infection fatality rate of between ~1-2%, with numerous cases likely undetected, previous SARS-

71

CoV and MERS-CoV outbreaks were more lethal with ~10% and ~35% case fatality rates,

72

respectively, raising the possibility that future novel coronaviruses have potentially high mortality

73

(5-7). Additionally, elicited immunity to SARS-CoV-2 infection may not protect against even

74

closely related novel coronaviruses from the same sarbecovirus subgenus (8). It is therefore critical

75

to not only address the current pandemic, but also develop vaccine platforms that can be readily

76

adapted to potential emerging coronaviruses.

The emergence of the novel severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) and

77
78

While we cannot readily predict which coronaviruses will next emerge into the human population,

79

a proactive approach to generate broadly protective immunity is to design immunogens that elicit

80

humoral responses targeting conserved sites on the coronavirus spike glycoprotein. Such sites may

81

include the receptor binding domain which engages host-cell receptors necessary to facilitate viral

82

cell entry; these spike-mediated interactions are conserved across coronaviruses (9). Indeed, a

83

subset of spike-directed antibodies from convalescent patients can potently neutralize SARS-CoV-

84

2; comparable neutralizing antibodies against SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV have also been

85

identified (6, 10-15). Some spike-directed antibodies that neutralize SARS-CoV-2 also bind the

86

SARS-CoV spike protein, highlighting the presence of cross-reactive neutralizing epitopes (10,

87

16, 17). Multimerized versions of the receptor binding domains (RBDs) of several coronaviruses

88

have previously been shown to be potent immunogens (18). Here, we describe a customizable

89

vaccine that elicits pan-sarbecovirus neutralization against both SARS-CoV-2 and the potentially

90

emergent WIV1-CoV (19). This approach focuses antibody responses to conserved, protective

91

RBD epitopes shared across sarbecoviruses. Its flexible nature allows facile interchanging of

92

potential vaccine strains updated to confer neutralization against new emerging coronaviruses.

93

Importantly, this approach was applied in context of “pre-existing” SARS-CoV-2 humoral

94

immunity with the goal of broadening neutralization while simultaneously boosting the

95

neutralizing antibody response to SARS-CoV-2, similar to the “back boost” effect of seasonal

96

influenza immunizations (20). Thus, it has the potential to provide protection against currently

97

circulating SARS-CoV-2, while proactively generating neutralizing antibody responses against

98

emerging coronaviruses.

99
100

We designed a cystine-stabilized and hyperglycosylated variant of a GCN4 trimerization tag to

101

generate a homotrimeric immunogen “cassette” to rapidly exchange RBDs from various

102

coronaviruses (Figure 1A, S1). Using a hyperglycosylated GCN4 allows the RBDs to remain

103

trimerized while the tag is “immune silent” (21). As a proof-of-concept for our immunization

104

approach, we selected the SARS-CoV, SARS-CoV-2, and WIV1-CoV RBDs as our starting

105

immunogens. We overexpressed RBD homotrimers in mammalian cells to maximize glycan

106

complexity and purified to homogeneity via size exclusion chromatography; the trimeric species

107

was confirmed using SDS-PAGE analysis under non-reducing conditions (Figure 1B-C). Their

108

antigenicity was assayed using conformational-specific antibodies CR3022 and/or B38 using

109

biolayer interferometry; the RBD homotrimers had comparable affinities in comparison to RBD

110

monomers (Figure S2). The purification tags were removed by enzymatic cleavage prior to

111

immunization.

112
113

To understand how preexisting immunity to SARS-CoV-2, whether acquired through natural

114

infection or vaccination, could affect immune responses to our immunogens, we primed our

115

cohorts with recombinant spike or RBD protein (22, 23). Our two control arms followed this prime

116

with subsequent homologous boosts of recombinant SARS-CoV-2 spike (“spike” cohort) or RBD

117

(“RBD” cohort); the latter is necessary for comparing the effect on immunogencity of monomeric

118

versus trimeric RBDs. Our experimental arms both received the spike prime and included a SARS-

119

CoV-2 RBD homotrimer boost (“homotrimer” cohort) and an equimolar boosting cocktail of

120

SARS-CoV-2, SARS-CoV, and WIV1-CoV RBD homotrimers (“cocktail” cohort) (Figure 2A).

121

All cohorts received the same total amount of protein in each immunization. We evaluated the

122

serum response against coronavirus-derived antigens using ELISAs (Figure 2B-C, S3). All four

123

immunization regimens resulted in similar patterns of serum reactivity. Each cohort demonstrated

124

a significant decrease in reactivity against SARS-CoV RBD as compared to the SARS-CoV-2

125

RBD or spike, though the magnitude of this difference was relatively small. The cohort which

126

received the RBD homotrimer cocktail boost had the highest overall endpoint titers, while the

127

cohort that received the monomeric SARS-CoV-2 RBD had the lowest overall endpoint titers; the

128

latter observation is consistent with other previous reports and likely due to the inefficiency of

129

monomeric RBDs effectively stimulating B cell receptors. We confirmed the non-immunogenic

130

nature of the hyperglycosylated GCN4 tag by assaying sera from the wildtype homotrimer cocktail

131

boost against another viral glycoprotein, hemagglutinin, with the same tag (Figure S4).

132
133

We next evaluated whether the serum response was directed towards cross-reactive, and

134

potentially broadly neutralizing RBD epitopes. Conservation across SARS-CoV-2, SARS-CoV,

135

and WIV1-CoV RBDs primarily occurs outside of the ACE-2 receptor binding motif (RBM)

136

(Figure S5A). Indeed, the previously characterized CR3022 and S309 antibodies have footprints

137

that together cover much of this conserved region, with epitope buried surface area (BSA) of 917

138

Å2 and 795 Å2 respectively in comparison to BSA of 869 Å2 for ACE-2 (16, 17, 24). We performed

139

serum competition by incubating RBD-coated ELISA plates with IgGs B38, P2B-2F6, CR3022,

140

and S309, representing each of the four previously defined “classes” of SARS-CoV-2 RBD

141

epitopes (25) (Figure S5B). We then assessed binding of mouse serum IgG. In all cohorts,

142

competition with both CR3022 and S309 significantly reduced serum titers against the SARS-CoV

143

and WIV1-CoV RBDs (Figure 2D). However, only the cohort receiving the RBD homotrimer

144

cocktail showed a significant reduction in serum titers against the SARS-CoV-2 RBD in

145

competition with both CR3022 and S309 (p = 0.0340) (Figure 2D). This result suggests a higher

146

degree of focusing to this region elicited specifically by the homotrimer cocktail immunogens.

148

To compare to the observed sera responses, we measured the IgG B cell receptors expanded by

149

the immunization regimens. We engineered a SARS-CoV-2 RBD variant that has two additional

150

glycans on the RBM which effectively block ACE-2 engagement (Figure S6). This variant

151

allowed us to bin SARS-CoV-2 spike-directed B cells into 3 populations: those that bound RBM

152

epitopes; those that bound the non-RBM epitopes on the RBD; and those that bound the

153

“remainder” of the spike protein (Figure S7). As a subset of SARS-CoV-2 spike-directed B cells,

154

the proportion of B cells specific for the SARS-CoV-2 RBM and non-RBM portion of the RBD

155

were considerably higher in the cohorts receiving the SARS-CoV-2 RBD homotrimer and RBD

156

homotrimer cocktail boosts (p = 0.0070) (Figure 3A). We also binned B cells that bound to both

157

the SARS-CoV-2 spike and either the SARS-CoV RBD or WIV1-CoV RBD (Figure 3B). We

158

found that cross-reactive IgG B cells predominantly targeted epitopes outside the RBM (the spike

159

remainder a result of the prime), mirroring what we observed in sera responses.

160
161

We next determined the neutralization potency from each of our cohorts using SARS-CoV-2,

162

SARS-CoV, and WIV1-CoV pseudoviruses (8). We observed a significant increase in WIV1-CoV

163

neutralization in the cohort that received the homotrimer cocktail boost compared to all other

164

cohorts (p = 0.0012) (Figure 4A). Importantly, this did not result in any significant loss in serum

165

neutralization potency against SARS-CoV-2 (p = 0.6594) (Figure 4B). We also observed higher

166

levels of SARS-CoV neutralization in the cohort that received the homotrimer cocktail boost as

167

compared to the cohort boosted with the SARS-CoV-2 RBD homotrimer and the SARS-CoV-2

168

monomeric RBD, though this trend was not significant (p = 0.2370) (Figure 4C). Thus, compared

169

to other cohorts, immunization with the RBD homotrimer cocktail resulted in a neutralizing

170

antibody response with both retrospective (e.g., SARS-CoV) and prospective breadth (e.g., WIV1-

171

CoV) even in context of preexisting immunity to SARS-CoV-2.

172
173

We wanted to determine what fraction of SARS-CoV-2 neutralization could be attributed to the

174

non-RBM RBD-directed response. To that end, we performed adsorption of pooled sera from each

175

cohort using MERS-CoV RBD (negative control), SARS-CoV-2 RBD, and a SARS-CoV-2 RBD

176

with four additional glycans engineered onto the RBM (SARS-CoV-2 DRBM RBD) (Figure S6,

177

S8). This construct was designed to block all RBM-directed antibodies as opposed to the one used

178

in flow cytometry, which only block antibodies that directly compete with ACE-2. Compared to

179

the samples adsorbed using MERS RBD, the samples adsorbed with either the SARS-CoV-2 RBD

180

or the SARS-CoV-2 DRBM RBD demonstrated a significant loss of SARS-CoV-2 neutralization

181

(p = 0.0343) (Figure 4D, S9). This indicates that non-RBM RBD-directed antibodies alone are

182

able to confer significant SARS-CoV-2 neutralization.

183
184

Here, we demonstrate that a cocktail of homotrimeric sarbecovirus RBDs can effectively generate

185

a neutralizing response to all components without a bias resulting from a SARS-CoV-2 imprinting

186

and without compromising SARS-CoV-2 neutralization. We find that this cross-neutralizing

187

antibody response is predominantly directed to RBD epitopes outside of the RBM. This is in

188

contrast to SARS-CoV-2 infection which does not appear to reliably generate cross-neutralizing

189

antibodies (8). Furthermore, previously reported vaccine candidates that aim to generate such a

190

cross-neutralizing response have not been shown to successfully refocus immunity towards cross-

191

neutralizing epitopes following an initial SARS-CoV-2 spike immunization (26). However, our

192

results suggest that following an initial SARS-CoV-2 exposure (e.g., commercial vaccination,

193

infection), subsequent boosting with a surveillance-informed selection of sarbecovirus RBD

194

homotrimers could result in pan-sarbecovirus immunity that protects against future pandemics.

Materials and Methods

212
213

Receptor Binding Domain and Homotrimer Expression and Purification

214

Receptor binding domains (RBDs) were designed based on the following sequences: SARS-CoV-

215

2 RBD (Genbank MN975262.1), SARS-CoV RBD (Genbank ABD72970.1), WIV1-CoV RBD

216

(Genbank AGZ48828.1), and MERS-CoV RBD (Genbank AHI48572.1). Constructs were codon

217

optimized by Integrated DNA Technologies, cloned into pVRC, and sequence confirmed by

218

Genewiz. The spike plasmid was obtained from Dr. Jason McLellan at the University of Texas,

219

Austin. It contained a Foldon trimerization domain as well as C-terminal HRV 3C-cleavable 6xHis

220

and 2xStrep II tags. Proteins were expressed in Expi293F cells (ThermoFisher) using

221

Expifectamine transfection reagents according to the manufacturer’s protocols. All proteins

222

included a C-terminal HRV 3C-cleavable 8xHis tag to facilitate purification. Monomeric RBD

223

proteins also contained SBP tags, while homotrimeric constructs contained a previously published

224

hyperglycosylated GCN4 tag with two additional C-terminal cystines (21). Versions of the MERS-

225

CoV RBD, SARS-CoV-2 DRBM RBD with four additional putative glycosylation sites (Figure

226

S5), and SARS-CoV-2 RBD with C-terminal 8xHis and SNAP tags (27) were also generated.

227
228

Transfections were harvested after 5 days and clarified via centrifugation. Cell supernatants were

229

passaged over Cobalt-TALON resin (Takara) for immobilized metal affinity chromatography via

230

the 8xHis tag. After elution, proteins were passed over a Superdex 200 Increase 10/300 GL (GE

231

Healthcare) size exclusion column in PBS (Corning). Prior to immunization, 8xHis tags were

232

cleaved using HRV 3C protease (ThermoScientific). Cleaved protein was repurified using Cobalt-

233

TALON resin in order to remove the protease, cleaved tag, and any uncleaved protein.

234
235

Fab and IgG Expression and Purification

236

Genes for the variable domains of the heavy and light chains were codon optimized by Integrated

237

DNA Technologies and cloned into pVRC constructs containing the respective constant domains

238

as previously described (28, 29). Heavy-chain Fab constructs contained a HRV 3C-cleavable

239

8xHis tag, while heavy-chain IgG constructs contained HRV 3C-cleavable 8xHis and SBP tags.

240

Transfections and purifications were performed according to the same protocols used for the RBDs

241

and homotrimers.

242
243

Biolayer Interferometry

244

Biolayer interferometry (BLI) experiments were performed using a BLItz instrument (ForteBio).

245

Fabs were immobilized on a FAB2G biosensor (ForteBio), and CoV proteins were the analytes.

246

All proteins were diluted in PBS at room temperature. Titrations were performed to determine

247

binding affinities. Single-hit concentrations at 10 µM were performed to get an approximate KD,

248

and then subsequent titrations at appropriate concentrations (at least three). A final KD estimate

249

was determined using a global fit model with a 1:1 binding isotherm using vendor-supplied

250

software.

251
252

Immunizations

253

C57BL/6 mice (Jackson Laboratory) received 20 µg of protein adjuvanted with 50% w/v Sigma

254

adjuvant in 100 µL of inoculum. All immunizations were administered through the intraperitoneal

255

route. Mice were primed (day 0) and received boosting immunizations at day 21 and day 42.

256

following the initial prime (day 0). Serum samples were collected on day 56 for characterization,

257

with flow cytometry occurring between days 56 and 63. In this study, female mice aged 6-10 weeks

258

were used. All experiments were conducted with institutional IACUC approval (MGH protocol

259

2014N000252).

260
261

Flow Cytometry

262

Spleens were isolated from mice and single cell suspensions were generated by straining through

263

a 70 µm cell strainer. Red blood cells were removed by treating with ACK lysis buffer and washed

264

with PBS. Single cell suspensions were first stained with Aqua Live/Dead amine-reactive dye

265

(0.025 mg/mL) before applying the following B and T cell staining panel using the staining

266

approach described previously (30, 31). This included the following mouse-specific antibodies:

267

CD3-BV786 (BioLegend), CD19-BV421 (BioLegend), IgM-BV605 (BioLegend), IgG-

268

PerCP/Cy5.5 (BioLegend).

270

Streptavidin-conjugated fluorophores were used to label the SBP-tagged proteins as probes for

271

flow cytometry. For the cohorts that received the SARS-CoV-2 spike prime followed by either the

272

SARS-CoV-2 RBD homotrimer boost or the RBD homotrimer cocktail boost, the following probes

273

were generated: SARS-CoV-2 RBD-APC/Cy7 (streptavidin-APC/Cy7 from BioLegend), SARS-

274

CoV-2 spike-StreptTactin PE (StrepTactin PE from IBA Lifesciences), SARS-CoV-2 DRBM

275

RBD-PE/Cy5.5 (streptavidin-PE/Cy5.5 from BioLegend). The panel for the cohort that received

276

the SARS-CoV-2 spike prime followed by the RBD homotrimer cocktail boost also included

277

SARS-CoV RBD-APC (streptavidin-APC from BioLegend) and WIV1-CoV RBD-BV650

278

(streptavidin-BV650 from BioLegend). For the cohort that received three SARS-CoV-2 spike

279

immunizations, the following probes were generated: SARS-CoV-2 RBD-APC/Cy7 (streptavidin-

280

APC/Cy7 from BioLegend), SARS-CoV-2 spike-StreptTactin PE (StrepTactin PE from IBA

281

Lifesciences),

282

Conjugations were performed as previously described (32). Briefly, fluorescent streptavidin

283

conjugates were added in 5 increments with 20 minutes of incubation with rotation at 4°C in

284

between to achieve a final molar ratio of probe to streptavidin valency of 1:1. The final conjugated

285

probe concentration was 0.1 µg/mL. Flow cytometry was performed on a BD FACSAria Fusion

286

cytometer (BD Biosciences). Analysis of the resultant FCS files was conducted using FlowJo

Serum ELISAs

290

Serum ELISAs were performed by coating Corning 96-well clear flat bottom high bind microplates

291

with 100 µL of protein at 5 µg/mL in PBS. Plates were incubated overnight at 4°C. Coating

292

solution was removed, and plates were blocked using 1% BSA in PBS with 1% Tween for 60

293

minutes at room temperature. Blocking solution was removed. Sera were diluted 1:40 in PBS, and

294

5-fold serial dilution was performed. CR3022 IgG at a starting dilution of 5 µg/mL with 5-fold

295

serial dilution was used as a positive control. 40 µL of primary antibody solution was applied to

296

each well. Primary incubation occurred for 90 minutes at room temperature. Plates were then

297

washed three times with PBS-Tween. HRP-conjugated rabbit anti-mouse IgG antibody (Abcam)

300

times with PBS-Tween. 1xABTS development solution (ThermoFisher) was applied as outlined

301

in the manufacturer’s recommendations. Development was stopped after 30 minutes with a 1%

302

SDS solution. Plates were read at 405 nm using a SectraMax iD3 plate reader (Molecular Devices).

303
304

Competition ELISAs

305

Competition ELISAs were performed using a similar protocol to serum ELISAs. The primary

306

incubation consisted of 40 µL of the relevant IgG at 1 µM. Incubation occurred at room

307

temperature for 60 minutes. Mouse sera were then spiked in at a final concentration in the linear

308

range of the serum ELISA titration curve (1:800 for the cohort that received three SARS-CoV-2

309

RBD monomer immunizations, 1:12,800 for all other cohorts). Plates were incubated at room

310

temperature for an additional 60 minutes. The primary solution was removed, and plates were

311

washed three times using PBS-Tween. HRP-conjugated goat anti-mouse IgG, human/bovine/horse

312

SP ads antibody (Southern Biotech) was applied at a concentration of 1:4000 and a volume of 150

313

µL as a secondary antibody. Plates were then incubated, washed, and developed using the same

314

procedure as the serum ELISAs.

315
316

ACE-2 Cell Binding Assay

317

ACE-2 expressing 293T cells (33) (a kind gift from Nir Hacohen and Michael Farzan) were

318

harvested and washed with PBSF. Cells were allocated such that 200,000 cells were labelled for

319

each condition. Cells were incubated with 100 µL of 200 nM antigen in PBS for 60 minutes on

320

ice. Following two washes with PBS supplemented with 2% FBS, cells were incubated with 50

321

µL of 1:200 streptavidin-PE (Invitrogen) on ice for 30 minutes. Cells were washed twice and

322

resuspended in 100 µL of PBS supplemented with 2% FBS. Flow cytometry was performed using

323

a Stratedigm S1000Exi Flow Cytometer. FCS files were analyzed using FlowJo (version 10).

324
325

Serum Adsorption

326

SNAP-tagged (27) MERS-CoV RBD, SARS-CoV-2 DRBM RBD with four additional putative

327

glycosylation sites (Figure S5), and SARS-CoV-2 RBD were conjugated to SNAP-Capture Pull-

328

Down resin (New England BioLabs). For each conjugation, 20 µL of settled resin was resuspended

329

in 100 µL of protein at 1 mg/mL per the manufacturer’s recommendations. Both MERS-CoV RBD

330

and SARS-CoV-2 RBD conjugation reactions also included 1 mM DTT to improve conjugation

331

efficiency. Wildtype-like reactivity to conformationally specific Fabs (CR3022, S309, and B38 for

332

SARS-CoV-2 RBD; m336 for MERS RBD) in the presence of 1 mM DTT was confirmed prior to

333

conjugation (14, 16, 17, 34). Conjugation occurred with rotation overnight at 4°C.

334
335

Following conjugation, the resin was washed 5 times with PBS via resuspension followed by

336

centrifugation and the removal of the supernatant. Sera from the mice in each cohort were pooled

337

and diluted 1:40 in PBS to a total volume of 100 µL. Diluted sera were added to the conjugated

338

resin and incubated with rotation overnight at 4°C. Resin was filtered from the sera following

339

incubation, and the adsorbed sera was used for neutralization assays and ELISAs.

340
341

Serum Adsorption ELISAs

342

Serum adsorption ELISAs were performed using a similar protocol to the serum ELISAs. For the

343

primary antibody incubation, adsorbed serum solution was diluted 1:2, and subsequent serial 5-

344

fold dilutions were generated. The remainder of the assay was performed according to the serum

345

ELISA procedure.

346
347

Pseudovirus Neutralization Assay

348

Serum neutralization against SARS-CoV-2, SARS-CoV, and WIV1-CoV was assessed using

349

lentiviral particles pseudotyped with the respective spike proteins as previously described (8).

350

Lentiviral particles were produced via transient transfection of 293T cells. The titers of viral

351

supernatants were determined via flow cytometry on 293T-ACE2 cells (33) and via the HIV-1

352

p24CA antigen capture assay (Leidos Biomedical Research, Inc.). Assays were performed in 384-

353

well plates (Grenier) using a Fluent Automated Workstation (Tecan). For mouse sera, samples

354

were initially diluted 1:9, with subsequent serial 3-fold dilutions. For sera that had previously been

355

adsorbed, the adsorbed sample was used for the first dilution, and serial 3-fold dilutions were

356

performed. Serum sample volume in each well was 20 µL, and 20 µL of pseudovirus containing

357

125 infectious units was added. The combination was incubated for 60 minutes at room

358

temperature. Afterwards, 10,000 293T-ACE2 cells (33) in 20 µL of media containing 15 µg/mL

359

polybrene was added. The plates were then incubated at 37°C for 60-72 hours.

361

A previously described assay buffer was used to lyse the cells (35). A Spectramax L luminometer

362

(Molecular Devices) was used to quantify luciferase expression. Percent neutralization at each

363

serum concentration was determined by subtracting background luminescence from cells only

364

sample wells, then dividing by luminescence of wells with only virus and cells. GraphPad Prism

365

was used to fit nonlinear regressions to the data, which allowed IC50 values to be calculated using

366

the interpolated 50% inhibitory concentration. IC50 values were calculated for all samples with a

367

neutralization value of at least 80% at the highest serum concentration.

368
369

Statistical Analysis

370

Statistical analyses and curve fitting were performed using GraphPad Prism (version 9). To

371

compare two populations of continuous variables without evidence of conforming to a normal

372

distribution, the non-parametric two-tailed Mann-Whitney U test was used. To compare multiple

373

populations meeting this description, the Kruskal-Wallis test was used with post hoc analysis using

374

Dunn’s multiple comparison testing. The ratio paired t-test was used to compare two populations

375

with evidence of normality. P values were corrected for multiple comparisons, and a p value <

376

0.05 was considered significant.
