38 Abstract
39

Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) was initially described as a viral

40 infection of the respiratory tract. It is now known, however, that several biological systems
41 are also affected, including the central nervous system (CNS). Neurological
42 manifestations such as stroke, encephalitis, and psychiatric conditions have been
43 reported in COVID-19 patients, but the neurotropic potential of the virus is still debated.
44 Herein, we sought to investigate SARS-CoV-2 infection in human neural cells. We
45 demonstrated that SARS-CoV-2 infection of neural tissue is non-permissive, however it
46 can elicit inflammatory response and cell damage. These findings are consistent with the
47 hypothesis that most of the neural damage caused by SARS-CoV-2 infection is due to a
48 systemic inflammation leading to indirect harmful effects on the CNS despite the absence
49 of local viral replication.

51 Author Summary
52

Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is the

53 causative agent of Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). COVID-19 was initially
54 described as a pulmonary disease, however, with an increased number of patients
55 showing neurological manifestations, the SARS-CoV-2 neurotropism became an
56 important issue. It is still unclear whether the new coronavirus causes direct damage to
57 the neural tissue or if the neurological symptoms are the result of systemic vascular and
58 inflammatory responses. Here, we investigated the consequences of the infection of
59 human neurospheres by SARS-CoV-2. Despite SARS-CoV-2 RNA occurrence in the
60 supernatant of neurospheres, we did not detect viral particles with infective capacity.
61 Nevertheless, we observed some neuroinflammatory markers and cell cytotoxicity as a
62 consequence of viral infection. Our study suggests that the impact of virus infection in the
63 CNS is limited and massive damage may be caused by general inflammation.

66 Introduction
67

Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is the

68 causative agent of the 2019 coronavirus disease (COVID-19), an airborne infectious
69 disease. Most affected patients have symptoms of respiratory infections, such as fever,
70 dry cough and dyspnea, and 5 to 10% of them evolve to severity/death. Respiratory
71 failure is the main event that explains fatality in COVID-19. Some authors raised the
72 possibility that at least part of the respiratory manifestations caused by COVID-19 could
73 be due to direct viral damage to the respiratory center located in the brain stem [1].
74

Apart from respiratory symptoms, anosmia and ageusia were identified as

75 hallmarks of COVID-19. Indeed, evidence of neurological disease associated with COVID76 19 is increasing; 30 to 60% of patients further present one or more neurological
77 symptoms, including paresthesia, altered consciousness, and headache [2,3]. Besides,
78 COVID-19 patients are at a 7-fold higher risk to suffer a stroke, and 2-6% progress to
79 cerebrovascular disease [4]. Less frequent neurological manifestations include
80 encephalopathy, encephalitis and Guillain-Barré syndrome [5,6].
81

Neuroinvasive capacity was shown for other highly pathogenic coronaviruses,

82 including the Middle East Respiratory Syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) [7] and SARS83 CoV [8,9]. Similarly to SARS-CoV, SARS-CoV-2 uses the angiotensin‐converting enzyme
84 2 (ACE2) receptor as the main cellular entry [10]. ACE2 is highly expressed in nasal
85 epithelial cells, which underlies the initiation of respiratory tract infection [11], but is also
86 present in multiple tissues [12].
87

Studies dissecting the putative mechanisms whereby SARS-CoV-2 enters the

88 central nervous system (CNS) are still scarce. At first, it was speculated that the virus
89 infects the olfactory neurons and reaches the brain by anterograde axonal transport.
90 However, it was shown in rodents that SARS-CoV-2 infects non-neural cells in the
91 olfactory epithelium rather than olfactory neurons, which could be attributed to the lack of
92 expression of ACE2 in these cells [13,14]. In contrast, a recent postmortem study found
93 viral particles throughout olfactory neuron projections and in the olfactory bulb of a few
94 patients [15]. Therefore, due to these conflicting findings, it is still debatable whether the
95 mechanism of SARS-CoV-2 invasion in the CNS is via olfactory neurons.
96

Viral infections targeting the brain were successfully modeled in vitro using

97 human neurospheres (NP) and brain organoids [16,17], so these models have been
98 chosen to investigate whether SARS-CoV-2 infects the brain tissue. While some
99 researchers found that the virus infects neurons and glia [18–20], others were unable to

100 detect viral antigens in these cells [21], suggesting SARS-CoV-2 neural infection was
101 dependent on experimental conditions and/or viral isolates.
102

Here, we investigated SARS-CoV-2 infection in NP. Although viral infection was

103 found to be non-permissive, it led to inflammatory response and cytotoxicity which was
104 correlated to the amount of virus in the inoculum. Therefore, we suggest that despite
105 insufficient viral infection and replication in the brain parenchyma, there are
106 consequences of the viral presence in the tissue, which may be enhanced by the entry of
107 inflammatory molecules resulting from a generalized inflammatory response.
108
109 Results
110 SARS-CoV-2 replication in neural cells is non-permissive
111

Histopathological analyses of several tissues from an infant deceased with

112 COVID-19 fully described in a case report from our group [22], showed viral presence by
113 immunofluorescence (IF) with anti-SARS-CoV-2 spike protein (SP) in the ChP, LV lining,
114 and in some locations of the frontal cerebral cortex (S1A Fig). SARS-CoV-2 infection was
115 confirmed by quantitative Reverse Transcriptase–Polymerase Chain Reaction (qRT-PCR)
116 (S1B Fig). The heart and the lungs, which have been previously demonstrated to be
117 permissive to SARS-CoV-2 infection [23–26], also showed presence of the virus (S1 Fig
118 and [22]). We sought to verify whether the expression levels of ACE2 receptor could
119 explain the differences in viral infection in different brain areas, compared with the
120 expression in the heart and lungs, which are known to be infected by SARS-CoV-2. Data
121 from Protein Atlas and Allen Brain Atlas databases were used for comparison [27,28]. We
122 found that ChP had higher ACE2 levels than other brain regions assessed (Fig 1A) and
123 the heart and lungs expressed higher levels of ACE2 in comparison with most neural
124 tissues (Fig 1A).
125

NP cultivated in vitro reproduced the low expression of ACE2 mRNA of brain

126 parenchyma, so we decided to compare it to human iPS-derived cardiomyocytes (CM), a
127 cell type know to express higher amount of ACE2 receptor and also used as an in vitro
128 model for cardiac infection [24,29]. NP show lower ACE2 expression (Fig 1B), validating
129 their use as a neural model of SARS-CoV-2 infection in vitro.

SARS-CoV-2-infection in NP was addressed using multiplicity of infection (MOI)

139 (0.01 and 0.1) and time of exposure to the viral particles (1h) known to infect other virus
140 permissive cells, such as CM, Vero and Calu-3 cells [24,29–31]. Five days post infection
141 (d.p.i.), SARS-CoV-2 could not be detected by immunostaining for double-stranded
142 (ds)RNA (Fig 2A). Additionally, infected NP did not stain for SARS-CoV-2 convalescent
143 sera (CS) (S2A Fig). In contrast, NP infected with Zika virus (ZIKV) were immunoreactive
144 for dsRNA (arrows, Fig 2A), and CM infected with SARS-CoV-2 were immunoreactive for
145 dsRNA and CS (arrows, Fig 2A and S2B Fig, correspondingly). Western blotting (WB) of
146 NP at 2 d.p.i. also showed the absence of viral proteins, using both anti-SARS-CoV-2 SP
147 (Fig 2B) and anti-SARS-CoV-2 CS (S2C Fig). On the other hand, infected Vero cells
148 showed prominent bands corresponding to the molecular weights of SARS-CoV-2 spike
149 protein and nucleoprotein, as detected by anti-SARS-CoV-2 SP (Fig 2B) and anti-SARS150 CoV-2 CS (S2C Fig), respectively.
151

Despite the absence of SARS-CoV-2 detection, the supernatant of NP

152 harvested 5 d.p.i. showed approximately 104 and 105 copies of genomic and subgenomic
153 viral RNA, respectively, which were at least 4 orders of magnitude lower than the

154 observed in infected Vero cells (Fig 2C). The infectivity of the viral particles in the
155 supernatant of NP (MOI 0.1), addressed by plaque forming unit (PFU) assay, showed no
156 infective viral progenies at 2 and 5 d.p.i, whereas for CM at 2 d.p.i. there was on average
157 2.8 x 106 PFU/mL (data not shown) (Fig 2D). The analysis of the virus inoculum in NP at
158 day 0 contained on average 3 x 103 PFU/mL, confirming that they were exposed to
159 infectious virus particles (Fig 2D). The aforementioned detection of RNA virus contrasts
160 with the absence of infectious virus progeny and may indicate that neural cells were a
161 dead-end for SARS-CoV-2 infection, or that the viral RNA detected in the supernatant was
162 a residual of the inoculum.

177 from 3 different cell lines in one experimental infection.

179 SARS-CoV-2 infection of neural cells triggers an increase in pro-inflammatory
180 cytokines
181

SARS-CoV-2 infection has been associated with cytokine storm as a poor

182 prognosis of disease progression [32]. Misbalance of cytokine levels in the CNS
183 microenvironment is associated with several pathologies [33–36], hence the need to
184 uncover the brain inflammation associated with SARS-CoV-2 infection. To investigate if
185 SARS-CoV-2 generates a direct inflammatory response in neural tissues, the supernatant
186 of infected NP was collected at 5 d.p.i. and analyzed by Multiplex Luminex assay to
187 measure over 20 cytokines and chemokines (Fig 2E and S3 Fig). The levels of IL-7 and
188 TNF-α in the infected NP were higher compared with mock condition (Fig 2E). The levels
189 of other cytokines and chemokines were not affected by SARS-CoV-2 infection in these
190 conditions (S3 Fig).
191
192 Prolonged exposure to higher inocula of SARS-CoV-2 does not elicit permissive
193 infection of NP.
194

The exposure time of NP to the virus inoculum and the low MOIs are sufficient

195 to detect the virus in permissive cells, including Vero and CM. The same conditions, in
196 contrast, did not prompt the detection of viral particles by neither IF nor WB in NP nor
197 even infective particles in the culture supernatant. Arguably, this evidence of non198 permissiveness could be explained by insufficient exposure time of the cells during viral
199 inoculation. A previous report showed infection of NP after 24 h inoculation time at higher
200 MOIs [37]. Additionally, it is speculated that the initial amount of virus in the inoculum is
201 crucial in determining the severity of COVID-19 symptoms [38]. To clarify these questions
202 and to better compare our results with data published by others, NP were then exposed to
203 a longer infection time and to higher MOIs.
204

We compared the capacity of SARS-CoV-2 to generate infectious viral particles

205 in NP using 1h and 24h incubation times and MOIs of 0.1, 1 and 10. Despite longer
206 exposure and higher viral titer, these conditions also did not support the production of
207 novel infective particles, as measured by plaque forming units assay of the respective
208 supernatants (Fig 3A). However, SARS-CoV-2 SP was detectable by IF in NP incubated
209 for 24h with the virus and analyzed 24h post infection (Fig 3B). On the other hand, after

210 48h and 72h of the same 24h-infection, the NP had no detectable SP immunostaining,
211 suggesting that viral proteins are only present transiently (Fig 3B and S2D Fig).
212 Remarkably, at a time point in which no virus could be detected in NP, LDH
213 measurements of culture supernatants revealed increased cytotoxicity at MOI 1 and 10,
214 irrespective of incubation time with the virus inoculum (Fig 3C). These data indicate that
215 exposure of NP to SARS-CoV-2 at high MOIs is neurotoxic and that, likely, death of
216 infected cells is responsible for the decline of virus titers over time (Fig 3). Also, the
217 incubation time with the inoculum does not seem to affect the outcome of infection, since
218 prolonged exposure time did not increase the production of viral particles or augment the
219 extent of cell damage.

231 Strain differences in SARS-CoV-2 RNA sequence could explain distinct
232 infectivity of neural cells
233

Genetic variation in SARS-CoV-2 isolates has been described and could help

234 to explain differences in the infectivity of neural tissue previously reported [39]. To
235 investigate whether possible genetic components could account for the differences
236 between SARS-CoV-2 infections reported in literature and in the current work, we
237 compared the phylogeny of the nucleotide sequences of our strain with the strains used in
238 these works, by means of the Wuhan strain genome as reference. The analysis showed
239 less than 1% variation among the genetic sequences of our strain, Zhang and
240 collaborators, and Song and collaborators (Table 1) [20,37]. These small variations
241 correlate with mutations in the receptor-binding domain of Spike protein and two non242 structural proteins (nsp) (Table 2).

Our viral isolate presented three missense mutations compared to the Wuhan

259 sequence: D614G on spike protein, S3884L on nsp7 and T265I on nsp2. The D614G
260 spike protein mutation has been correlated with more infectious behavior of the strain
261 [39]. Nsp 7 participates in SARS-CoV-2 replication, being a co-factor for RNA polymerase.
262 The nsp2 role is unknown and may be related to the disruption of intracellular host
263 signaling and mitochondrial biogenesis [40].
264
265 Discussion
266

Neurological manifestations of COVID-19 fueled research on the putative viral

267 infection of the brain. However, absence or low detection of SARS-CoV-2 was described
268 in the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF), and so far many reports have described the presence of
269 SARS-CoV-2 in the brain parenchyma [20,26,41,42]. Here, we bring the attention to
270 SARS-CoV-2 infection in the ChP in its LV lining, and in the frontal cortex of an infant’s
271 brain (S1A Fig), which was confirmed by qRT-PCR for viral RNA (S1B Fig) (pathological
272 analysis of this case was described in detail in [22]).
273

The detection of SARS-CoV-2 was more pronounced in the ChP than in the

274 cortex (S1A Fig). This matches expression data for the SARS-CoV receptor ACE2, which
275 is enriched in ChP both in vivo and in vitro, in comparison to other brain areas, including
276 cortex [18,21] (Fig 1A). Our protocol for differentiating NP generates cortical brain-like

277 tissue [43], which recapitulates the low expression levels of ACE2 mRNA observed in the
278 human cortical tissue (Fig 1B). ACE2 levels are increased in patients with comorbidities,
279 suggesting a relationship between ACE2 expression and susceptibility to severe COVID280 19 [44]. Strategies to regulate the expression of ACE2 have been proposed as therapies
281 to fight viral infection [45,46]. Also, it remains unaddressed if neuropsychiatric conditions
282 and neurodegenerative diseases impact the expression of ACE2 in the brain [47] and how
283 they could interfere with the susceptibility of CNS infection. Indeed, there is an increased
284 risk for mental illness in COVID-19 patients, especially those who had previously
285 psychiatric episodes [48]. In this context, human NP and brain organoids could be a
286 model for in vitro drug testing, including monitoring changes in ACE2 expression and
287 correlation with susceptibility to SARS-CoV-2 infection.

One experimental aspect that drew our attention was the amount of virus used

289 to infect cells in other studies. Previous reports have demonstrated SARS-CoV-2 antigens
290 in NP and brain organoids [19,20,37] using MOIs at least 100 times higher than the lowest
291 MOI used in our investigation. Although productive infection in neural cells was claimed at
292 MOI 10 [37], we did not obtain infectious viral particles at similar experimental conditions
293 (Fig 2D).
294

The genetic comparison between our strain and the strains of other works

295 showed little variations (Table 1) that, nevertheless, caused potentially significant
296 alterations in the amino acid sequence of viral proteins (Table 2). Indeed, most of these
297 variations might reflect the genetic diversity of the SARS-CoV-2 since the original
298 outbreak [49]. The strain used in the current work has a D614G mutation that renders the
299 virus highly infectious by increasing ACE2 interaction [39]. This D614G spike mutation
300 has also been associated with increased binding of neutralizing antibodies [50]. Our strain
301 has also a mutation in a cofactor of SARS-CoV-2 RNA-dependent RNA polymerase,
302 nsp7, that did not lead to impairments in viral replication in permissive cells such as Vero
303 (Fig 2C), however, this mutation could not be excluded as responsible for the differences
304 observed between the studies. Finally, the T265I nsp2 mutation falls within the
305 extracellular N-terminus of the protein [51] and is thought to cause structural changes,
306 and which can now be found in all geographical locations [52]. Similarly to our work,
307 Zhang and collaborators have also used a strain with increased sensitivity to neutralizing
308 antibodies [53]. On the other hand, Song and collaborators used a viral strain that is not
309 world spread [54–56] and it has been reduced in frequency over time since February 2020
310 [56]. In addition, the S5932F mutation on nsp14 (ExoN), could lead to altered
311 proofreading exonuclease activity via weaker interaction with nsp10, facilitating the
312 emergence of diverse viral sequences with potential selective advantage [57].

313

Cells from lungs, intestine, heart and kidney, which have already been

314 demonstrated to be sites of infection [25,58–60], produce infectious viral progeny in vitro
315 with MOIs ranging from 0.01 to 1 [30,31]. Therefore, it seems unlikely that even in severe
316 neuro-COVID cases such as the one cited here, neural cells would be exposed to
317 quantities equal to or more than one plaque forming virus per cell. Our observation that
318 ChP is infected to a much greater extent than other regions of the brain, together with the
319 lack of infectious virus particles in vitro with MOI < 1, argue against the clinical relevance
320 of using high titers of SARS-CoV-2 for modeling the infection in vitro. A study using viral
321 titers of MOI 0.5 showed that SARS-CoV-2 exclusively infects ChP cells in brain
322 organoids, but no other cell types. In the same report, even at higher viral titers (MOI 10),
323 infection of neurons was minor [21]. Our observation that SARS-CoV-2 infects the ChP
324 without significantly spreading to other brain areas (S1 Fig) and the absence of a
325 productive infection in human NP with SARS-CoV-2 at MOI of 0.1, 1 and 10 even at
326 increased inoculation time (Fig 3), corroborate these findings.
327

Despite non-permissiveness to SARS-CoV-2 infection of the brain parenchyma,

328 the data presented here also points to direct pro-inflammatory and cytotoxic response of
329 this tissue. This direct effect is probably related to the number of viral particles able to first
330 get in contact with the CNS. It was observed in NP an increase in IL-7 and TNFα levels
331 following infection with low MOIs, but not of other inflammatory cytokines such as IL-6. IL332 7 has antiviral activity [61] and neurotrophic effects in neurons [62,63] and its increase at
333 MOIs 0.01 and 0.1 may correlate with a protective neuroimmune response dependent on
334 virus titer amount. TNF-α is secreted by astrocytes and microglia in response to injury,
335 including viral infection, inducing neuronal damage [64]. It also regulates the permeability
336 of the blood-brain barrier and neuronal plasticity [65,66]. Certainly, these results are
337 interesting with respect to a direct inflammatory response from neural cells that had been
338 in contact with SARS-CoV-2 and deserve further experiments. It is expected that in the
339 complex scenario of the response to viral infection, multiple cytokines are regulated
340 promoting cell protection and also limiting infection by inducing cell death. Therefore, the
341 extent of neural damage should correspond to a balance between these responses.
342

This work supports the hypothesis that the infection of ChP with SARS-CoV-2

343 may change CNS homeostasis to increase the permeability of the blood-CSF barrier.
344 Virus particles reaching the brain parenchyma can trigger inflammatory response leading
345 to tissue damage. Notably, neurological symptoms are more frequent in severe patients
346 with exacerbated inflammation, compared to mild or moderate ones, suggesting that an
347 overall increase in the inflammatory response may set place for CNS damage [6]. Low
348 type I interferon response in infants’ brains may correlate with higher susceptibility for

349 virus entry in CNS, but also patients with previous neurological and psychiatric disorders
350 which may have weakened immune response or enhanced inflammation should be
351 closely monitored [48,67].

353 Materials and methods
354 Cell cultivation
355

Human induced pluripotent stem (iPS) cells were obtained from the Coriell

356 Institute for Medical Research repository (GM23279A) or produced in house with
357 CytoTune™-iPS 2.0 Sendai Reprogramming Kit (A16517- Invitrogen) from skin fibroblasts
358 [68] or urine epithelial cells [69]. iPS cells were cultured in StemFlex media (A33494 359 Thermo Fisher Scientific01) on top of Matrigel (BD Biosciences, Franklin Lakes, NJ).
360 NSCs are generated from human-induced pluripotent stem cells (hiPSCs) following the
361 published Life Technologies protocol for Induction of Neural Stem Cells from Human
362 Pluripotent Stem Cells (Publication number: MAN0008031). NSCs were grown in neural
363 expansion medium (Advanced DMEM / F12 and Neurobasal medium (1: 1) with 1%
364 neural induction supplement) on a surface previously coated with Geltrex LDEV-Free
365 (Thermo Fisher Scientific, A1413302) and when cells reached 90% confluence the culture
366 was split with Accutase (Merck Millipore, SCR005).
367

NP were prepared in suspension as follows: upon reaching 90% of confluence,

368 3 x 106 NSCs were split and plated in a 6 well-plate well and cultured on an orbital shaker
369 at 90 rpm for 7 days in standard culture conditions. The culture medium was composed of
370 Neurobasal medium/DMEM-F12 1:1, supplemented with 1x N2 (Thermo Fisher Scientific)
371 and 1x B27 (Thermo Fisher Scientific), and it was changed each 3-4 days [70].
372 Alternatively, NP were prepared directly in 96 well plates. After NSCs reached 90% of
373 confluence, cells were split with Accutase (Merck Millipore, SCR005) and counted on the
374 Neubauer chamber. Cells were then centrifuged at 300 xg for 5 minutes and resuspended
375 in neural medium with half DMEM / F12 (Life Technologies, 11330-032) and half
376 Neurobasal medium (Thermo Fisher Scientific, 12348017) supplemented with 1x N2
377 (Invitrogen 17502001) and 1x B27 (Thermo Fisher Scientific, 17504001) supplements.
378 Subsequently, 9 x 103 cells in 150 μL were plated per well of a round bottom Ultra-low
379 attachment 96 well plate (Corning, 7007), followed by centrifugation at 300 xg for 3
380 minutes to assure sedimentation. To minimize neurosphere damage, the medium of each
381 well was changed every other day by only removing 70-100 μL and adding 150 μL of new
382 medium. iPSC derived human cardiomyocytes were purchased from Pluricell (São Paulo,

383 Brazil) [71]. CMs were used between day 25 and day 35 of differentiation, and average
384 cell purity by cardiac specific troponin T protein was 86%.
385 Total RNA isolation
386

Seven days-old NP were cultured in 6-well plates, harvested and immediately

387 frozen at -80°C until further processing. Total RNA isolation was performed using
388 ReliaPrepTM RNA Tissue Miniprep System (Promega Corporation) according to
389 manufacturer’s instructions. For cardiomyocytes, total RNA was isolated using TRIzolTM
390 reagent, according to manufacturer’s recommendations (Thermo Fisher Scientific). RNA
391 concentration and quality were quantified on a NanoDropTM 2000c Spectrophotometer
392 (Thermo Fisher Scientific); and integrity and purity were evaluated by 1.8% agarose gel
393 electrophoresis using a photo documentation device equipped with a UV lamp (L-PIX,
394 Loccus Biotecnologia). Then, samples were digested with DNase I, Amplification Grade,
395 following the manufacturer’s instructions (Invitrogen, Thermo Fisher Scientific). 2 μg of
396 RNA from DNAse-treated samples were reverse transcribed using M-MLV for
397 complementary DNA generation (cDNA) (Thermo Fisher Scientific).
398 Quantitative Reverse Transcriptase–Polymerase Chain Reaction (qRT-PCR)
399

For gene expression analysis of NP and cardiomyocytes, qRT-PCR reactions

400 were conducted in three replicates with a final reaction volume of 10 µL in MicroAmp Fast
401 Optical 96 Well Reaction Plates (Thermo Fisher Scientific) containing 1X GoTaq qPCR

417 method implemented in LinRegPCR v. 2020.0, which considers qPCR mean efficiencies
418 estimated by the window-of-linearity method [72,73]. Briefly, N0 values were calculated in
419 LinRegPCR using default parameters. Then, the arithmetic mean of N0 values from gene
420 of interest (GOI) was normalized by taking its ratio to the N0 geometric mean of the
421 reference genes (REF: GAPDH and HRRT-1; N0GOI/N0REF).
422 SARS-CoV-2 propagation
423

SARS-CoV-2 obtained from a nasopharyngeal swab from a confirmed case in

424 Rio de Janeiro, Brazil (GenBank accession no. MT710714) was expanded in African
425 green monkey kidney cells (Vero, subtype E6). Virus isolation was performed after a
426 single passage in cell culture in a 150 cm2 flask, previously infected with SARS-CoV-2 at
427 multiplicity of infection (MOI) 0.01. All procedures related to virus culture were handled in
428 a biosafety level 3 (BSL3) facility, according to WHO guidelines. Virus stocks were kept at
429 -80°C.
430 Cell infection
431

Seven days-old NP were infected with SARS-CoV-2 at MOI 0.1 (9 x 102 PFU

432 per neurosphere). Following 1h incubation, the inoculum was partially replaced by fresh
433 medium and NP were cultured for additional 2 and 5 days, with orbital shaking at 90 rpm
434 in standard conditions (5% CO2 and 37°C). The medium was not completely replaced to
435 avoid excessive stress as explained above. NP exposed to uninfected Vero’s culture
436 medium were used as controls of infection (Mock). NP (≈ 50 to 200) were used per
437 experimental group for each analysis. Culture supernatants were collected at 2 and 5
438 days post-infection for virus titration by plaque forming units (PFU) assay and/or real time
439 qRT-PCR. The assay was performed in a single experiment, consisting of three cell lines
440 generated from 3 independent donors.
441

In lieu of the formerly described method, seven days-old NP were separately

442 (one per well) infected for 1h or 24h with SARS-CoV-2 at different MOIs (0.1, 1 and 10; 9
443 x 103 cells per neurosphere). After incubation, the inoculum was partially replaced by
444 fresh medium, for the reasons stated above, and NP were cultured in standard conditions
445 (5% CO2 and 37°C). Supernatants and NP were collected at 24h, 48h and 72h post446 infection. NP exposed to uninfected Vero’s culture medium were used as controls of
447 infection (Mock). 5 to 24 NP were distributed by each experimental group.
448

Cardiomyocytes were infected with SARS-CoV-2 at MOI 0.1 for 1h. Next, the

449 inoculum was replaced by fresh medium and cultured in standard conditions for 48-72 h.

450 After that, the monolayer was fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde (PFA) solution and the
451 supernatant was harvested for cytokine evaluation.
452 Immunofluorescence staining
453

NP were fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde solution (Sigma-Aldrich) for 1h, followed

454 by cryopreservation with 30% sucrose solution overnight. Then, samples were embedded
455 in O.C.T compound (Sakura Finetek, Netherland) and frozen at -80˚C. The O.C.T blocks
456 were sectioned at 20 μm-slices with a Leica CM1860 cryostat. After washing with PBS,
457 sections were incubated in permeabilization/blocking solution (0.3% Triton X-100/ 3%
458 goat serum) for 2h. The primary antibody was incubated overnight at 4˚C [anti-double459 stranded RNA (dsRNA) monoclonal antibody (1:200, Scicons)]. Then, sections were
460 incubated with secondary antibody goat anti-mouse Alexa Fluor 488; 1:400, A-11001 461 Thermo Fisher Scientific) for 2h. Nuclei were counterstained with 0.5 μg/mL 40-6-diamino462 2-phenylindole (DAPI) for 10 minutes and the slides were mounted with Aqua-Poly/Mount
463 (Polysciences).
464

After fixation, cardiomyocytes were washed with PBS and then incubated with

465 permeabilization/blocking solution (0.3% Triton X-100 / 3% bovine serum albumin) for 1h.
466 Then, cells were incubated with primary antibody anti-dsRNA (1:200) overnight at 4ºC.
467 Day after, cells were incubated with the secondary antibody goat anti-mouse Alexa Fluor
468 488 (1:400) for 1h. Nuclei were counterstained with DAPI for 5 minutes and mounted with
469 50% PBS-Glycerol.
470

Images of NP and cardiomyocytes were acquired on a Leica TCS-SP8 confocal

471 microscope with the 63x and 20x objective, respectively.
472 Plaque forming unit assay
473

For virus titration, monolayers of Vero E6 cells (2 x 104 cell/well) in 96-well

474 plates were infected with serial dilutions of supernatants containing SARS-CoV-2 for 1
475 hour at 37°C. Semi-solid high glucose DMEM medium containing 2% FSB and 2.4%
476 carboxymethylcellulose was added and cultures were incubated for 3 days at 37 °C.
477 Then, the cells were fixed with 10% formalin for 2 h at room temperature. The cell
478 monolayer was stained with 0.04% solution of crystal violet in 20% ethanol for 1 h. Plaque
479 numbers were scored in at least 3 replicates per dilution by independent readers blinded
480 to the experimental group and the virus titers were determined by plaque-forming units
481 (PFU) per milliliter.

482 Molecular detection of SARS-CoV-2 RNA
483

The total RNA from neurosphere’s supernatant was extracted using QIAamp

484 Viral RNA (Qiagen), according to manufacturer’s instructions. Quantitative RT-PCR was
485 performed using QuantiTect Probe RT-PCR Kit (Quiagen®) in a StepOne™ Real-Time
486 PCR System (Thermo Fisher Scientific). Amplifications were carried out in 25 µL reaction
487 mixtures containing 2X reaction mix buffer, 50 µM of each primer, 10 µM of probe, and 5
488 µL of RNA template. Primers, probes, and cycling conditions recommended by the
489 Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) protocol were used to detect the
490 SARS-CoV-2 (https://www.fda.gov). Alternatively, genomic (ORF1) and subgenomic
491 (ORFE) were detected, as previously described [74].
492 Western blot analysis
493

After 2 days post-infection (d.p.i), 100 µL of sample buffer without bromophenol

494 blue (62.5 mM Tris-HCl, pH 6.8, containing 10% glycerol, 2% SDS and 5% 2495 mercaptoethanol) was added to the NP and, then, samples were frozen at -80°C. Next,
496 samples were gently broken down with a disposable pestle (BAF 199230001- Sigma, Bel497 Art) and cell extracts were boiled at 95°C for 10 min and centrifuged at 4°C 16,000x g for
498 15 min to remove insoluble material. Protein content was estimated using the Bio-Rad
499 Protein Assay (#5000006, Biorad). After addition of bromophenol blue (0.02%), extract
500 samples (40 µg/lane for NP and 15 µg/lane for Vero cells) were separated by
501 electrophoresis on a 10% SDS polyacrylamide gel and transferred to polyvinylidene
502 difluoride (PVDF) membranes. Membranes were blocked in 5% non-fat milk in Tris503 Buffered Saline with 0.1% Tween-20 (TBS-T) for 1 hour at room temperature. Membranes
504 were then incubated overnight at 4°C, in the presence of anti-SARS-CoV-2 SP (1:2,000,
505 #GTX632604 - GeneTex) and anti-actin (1:2000, MAB1501, Millipore) diluted in TBS-T
506 with 5% non-fat milk. Then, membranes were incubated with peroxidase-conjugated
507 antibody goat anti-Mouse IgG (H+L), HRP-conjugate (1:10,000, G21040 -Molecular
508 Probes). The signals were developed using ECL Prime Western Blotting System
509 (#GERPN2232, Sigma) for five minutes and chemiluminescence was detected with an
510 Odyssey-FC System® (Imaging System - LI-COR Biosciences). Membranes were also
511 stripped for re-staining by incubating for three cycles of 10 minutes in stripping buffer (pH
512 2.2, 200 mM glycine, SDS 0,1% and 1% Tween-20), the buffer was discarded, then the
513 membranes were washed for 5 minutes with PBS (three times) and 5 minutes with 0.1%
514 TBS-T (three times). Next, the membranes were blocked again and processed for
515 immunolabeling as described above.

516 Cytokine multiplex assay and LDH cytotoxicity assay
517

A multiplex biometric immunoassay containing fluorescent dyed microbeads

518 was used to measure cytokines in the cell culture supernatant (Bio-Rad Laboratories,
519 Hercules, CA, USA). The following cytokines were quantified: IL-1β, IL-1RA, IL-2, IL-4, IL520 5, IL-6, IL-7, IL-8, IL-9, IL-10, IL-12(p70), IL-13, IL-15, IL-17, basic FGF, Eotaxin, G-CSF,
521 GM-CSF, IP-10, MCP-1, MIP-1α, MIP-1β, PDGF-BB, RANTES, TNF-α, and VEGF; and
522 cytokine levels were calculated by Luminex technology (Bio-Plex Workstation; Bio-Rad
523 Laboratories, USA). The analysis of data was performed using software provided by the
524 manufacturer (Bio-Rad Laboratories, USA). A range of 0.51–8,000 pg/mL recombinant
525 cytokines was used to establish standard curves and the sensitivity of the assay. Cell
526 death was determined according to the activity of lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) in the
527 culture supernatants using a CytoTox® Kit (Promega, USA) according to the
528 manufacturer’s instructions.
529

Statistics were performed using GraphPad Prism software version 8. Numerical

530 variables from NP experiments were tested regarding their distribution using the Shapiro531 Wilk test. For those following a normal (parametric) distribution, One-way analysis of
532 variance (ANOVA) with Dunnet’s post-hoc test was used to compare differences among
533 groups; and for nonparametric data, Kruskal-Wallis test with Dunn’s post-hoc test was
534 used to compare differences.
535 SARS-CoV-2 strains sequence analyses
536

Nucleotide sequences from our strain (GenBank accession No. MT710714),

537 from strains used in others works [20,37], and from SARS-CoV-2 reference genome
538 (Wuhan-Hu-1, GenBank accession No. NC_045512.2) were retrieved from NCBI
539 database and from Multiple Sequence Alignment (MSA). Visualization of SARS-CoV-2
540 sequences was performed using ClustalW [75] implemented in MEGA X program- version
541 10.1.8 [76]. Maximum Likelihood phylogenetic analyses were conducted using the JTT
542 matrix-based model [77] with confidence assessed by bootstrap with 1,000 replicates. For
543 identification of amino acid mutations, the coding data was translated assuming a
544 Standard genetic code and compared to the SARS-CoV-2 reference genome Wuhan-Hu545 1.
