Abstract
Summary: We developed a new online database that contains the most updated published scientific
literature, online news and reports, CDC and National Institutes of Health (NIH) resources. The tool
captures emerging discoveries and applications of genomics, molecular, and other precision medicine
and precision public health tools in the investigation and control of coronavirus diseases, including
COVID-19, MERS-CoV, and SARS.
Availability: Coronavirus Disease Portal (CDP) can be freely accessed via

1 INTRODUCTION

Advances in genomics and precision health continue to influence the evolution of medicine and
public health (Feero, 2017). In particular, the emerging use of pathogen genomics has ushered in a new
era of precision public health (Armstrong, 2019). The COVID-19 pandemic has catalyzed the scientific
research community to investigate the biology, epidemiology, and clinical manifestations of infection
with this novel virus, SARS-CoV-2, as well as potential therapeutic and preventive interventions.
.Hundreds of articles have already been published in the peer reviewed literature and nearly two
thousand more in preprint servers .
How are new tools of genomics and precision health and technologies being used to investigate
and control COVID-19? As part of an effort to help translate new technologies into public health
benefit, our office at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) has created a freely
accessible, web-based application called Coronavirus Disease Portal (CDP) in Genomics and Precision

Health, a component of the CDC Public Health Genomics and Precision Health Knowledge Base
1

(PHGKB).2 PHGKB was launched in 2016 as a tool for researchers, clinicians and public health
professionals interested in the translation of research on human and pathogen genomics, big data and
machine learning, and other precision health technologies into population health benefits. PHGKB has
been described in detail elsewhere and features a suite of curated and continuously updated databases
(Yu et al, 2016).
2 IMPLEMENTATION

CDP is a web-based application based on J2EE technology3 with Java open-source frameworks
including Hibernate4 and Strut.5 As one component of the PHGBKB system, CDP has been integrated
into the overall architecture of PHGKB, described previously (Yu et al, 2007a). PubMed records are
one of main data resources and are e indexed with MeSH terminology;6; the MeSH tree hierarchies and
the Unified Medical Language System 7 metathesaurus enhance the search capacity of the system.
Data in the database are collected mainly through automatic retrieval from PubMed and manual
curation by domain experts at CDC. CDP automatically retrieves scientific literature in genomics and
precision health daily from PubMed with two specifically designed queries: Genomics Precision Health
and Non-Genomics Precision Health (Appendix). An automatic PubMed script using NCBI Eutils8 is
used to retrieve records automatically, based on the two PubMed queries, and to identify records related
to COVID-19. Online news and reports related to coronavirus are selected by CDC staff from our
weekly horizon scan for Genomics Health Impact Update9 and CDC Advanced Molecular Detection
(AMD) Clips.10 A web-based curation pipeline allows CDC domain experts to select and curate
important news, reports, and articles related to COVID-19 and other coronaviruses. A text mining
technique (Yu et al, 2007b) is used to identify and standardize the country information associated with
the authors in PubMed records. All data selection processes are performed daily.
3 DESCRIPTION OF FEATURES

bioRxiv preprint doi: https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.04.21.050922; this version posted April 21, 2020. The copyright holder for this preprint (which
was not certified by peer review) is the author/funder. This article is a US Government work. It is not subject to copyright under 17 USC 105
and is also made available for use under a CC0 license.

The new portal is an online, searchable database of published scientific literature, CDC and NIH
resources, and other information. It is designed to capture emerging discoveries and applications of
genomics, molecular, and other precision health technologies in the investigation and control of
coronaviruses, including MERS-CoV and SARS, with a particular focus on SARS-CoV-2. The records
selected are further classified into categories: SARS-CoV-2 versus other coronaviruses, and genomic
versus non-genomic. The CDP links to other curated contents of PHGKB and selected external
resources. CDP is designed as a user-friendly interface (Figure 1) with the following functionalities: 1)
Free text search can be performed as an option in either the entire PHGKB dataset or limited by
subcategories (e.g., COVID-19 only, genomics only) ; 2) Search results can be further filtered by
publication year, journal, country of the authors; 3) A graph of the number of publications by year is
generated dynamically for the search results; 4) Search results can be downloaded in tab-delimited text
format; 5) User can sign up for a daily email alert that contains any new updated content. As of April 21,
2020, CDP contained 6123 records, including 5610 PubMed abstracts by authors from 111 countries,
published since 2000 in 910 journals. Among these are 465 publications related to COVID-19, most
published by Chinese researchers in 2020. CDP also includes 154 publications on preprint servers
(bioRxiv.org and medRxiv.org), as well as 513 online news stories and reports.

4 EXAMPLES OF THE USAGE

Using CDP, users can dynamically create quick snapshots of research on coronavirus or COVID19 based on any combination of variables available in the dataset including publication type (PubMed vs
other), publication year, publication journal, country of authors, and genomic vs. non-genomic. .
Examples of possible analyses using CDP data as of April 21, 2020 include:
1. Trend in number of PubMed publications by year on all coronaviruses and COVID-19 (Figure 2).
This analysis shows three peaks in the number of scientific publications, reflecting three

major epidemics of coronavirus (SARS, MERS, and COVID-19).

5 DISCUSSION

COVID-19 is the biggest public health challenge of our times. The rapid emergence of a novel
coronavirus has accelerated the application of genomics and big data tools and technologies to its
investigation and control. Our new portal captures diverse examples of such applications, including the
use of whole genome sequencing to track the virusâ€™s origin and spread, including detailed geographic
information at the global, country, and local levels; the use of smartphone based tracking and control;
and rapid characterization of risk factors related to severe disease such as age and underlying medical
conditions. The role of host genomic factors is beginning to be explored. Machine learning and data
science are contributing to diagnosis and prediction of complications. Emerging digital technologies
could augment traditional public-health strategies for tackling COVID-19 including public health
surveillance, detection, and control, and mitigation of impact on healthcare delivery.
The information accessible CDP represents about 15% of the total scientific literature and
resources on COVID-19, selected to focus on the use of genomics and other precision health tools in
scientific studies of COVID-19. We are continuously updating this resource as more data become
available. We hope that CDP can serve as a scientific information portal to facilitate coronavirus
research in genomics and precision public health.
