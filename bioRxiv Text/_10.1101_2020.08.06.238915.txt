ABSTRACT
The design of an immunogenic scaffold that serves a role in treating a pathogen, and can be
rapidly and predictively modeled, has remained an elusive feat. ​Here, we demonstrate that
SARS-BLOCK™ synthetic peptide scaffolds act as antidotes to SARS-CoV-2 spike
protein-mediated infection of human ACE2-expressing cells​. Critically, SARS-BLOCK™
peptides are able to potently and competitively inhibit SARS-CoV-2 S1 spike protein receptor
binding domain (RBD) binding to ACE2, the main cellular entry pathway for SARS-CoV-2, while
also binding to neutralizing antibodies against SARS-CoV-2. In order to create this potential
therapeutic antidote-vaccine, we designed, simulated, synthesized, modeled epitopes, predicted
peptide folding, and characterized behavior of a novel set of synthetic peptides. The biomimetic
technology is modeled off the receptor binding motif of the SARS-CoV-2 coronavirus, and
modified to provide enhanced stability and folding versus the truncated wildtype sequence.
These novel peptides attain single-micromolar binding affinities for ACE2 and a neutralizing
antibody against the SARS-CoV-2 receptor binding domain (RBD), and demonstrate significant
reduction of infection in nanomolar doses. We also demonstrate that soluble ACE2 abrogates
binding of RBD to neutralizing antibodies, which we posit is an essential immune-evasive
mechanism of the virus. SARS-BLOCK™ is designed to “uncloak” the viral ACE2 coating
mechanism, while also binding to neutralizing antibodies with the intention of stimulating a
specific neutralizing antibody response. Our peptide scaffolds demonstrate promise for future
studies evaluating specificity and sensitivity of immune responses to our antidote-vaccine. In
summary, SARS-BLOCK™ peptides are a promising COVID-19 antidote designed to combine
the benefits of a therapeutic and vaccine, effectively creating a new generation of prophylactic
and reactive antiviral therapeutics whereby immune responses can be enhanced rather than
blunted.

MAIN
We developed and characterized four novel synthetic peptide inhibitors, SARS-BLOCK™, to
serve as combined prophylactic, therapeutic, and immune stimulants against the novel
coronavirus. In this study, we utilized computational techniques to design peptides that mimic
the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein’s receptor binding domain (RBD) to ACE2 (Figures 1 & 2), while
displaying neutralizing antibody binding motifs. These peptides were designed and simulated
using SWISS-MODEL, PDBePISA, RaptorX, and Ligandal’s proprietary nanomaterials and
design approaches. After synthesizing the peptides using solid-phase peptide synthesis
(SPSS), we characterized their binding to ACE2 and neutralizing antibodies via biolayer
interferometry (Figures 3 & 4, Table 1). Next, we infected cells expressing ACE2 with
pseudotyped lentiviruses displaying the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein and expressing a luciferase
reporter, and measured infection inhibition and toxicity following exposure to 7 concentrations
(30nM - 20​μM) of peptides (Figures 5 & 7)​. We compared these results to infection inhibition
and toxicity mediated by 6 concentrations of soluble ACE2 (4nM - 1μM), 7 concentrations of
SARS-CoV-2 receptor binding domain (RBD, 1nM - 1μM), and 5 concentrations of a potent
neutralizing antibody against the SARS-CoV-2 RBD (6nM - 500nM) (Figures 6 & 7). At the
highest concentrations measured (20μM), we observed that peptides 1, 4, and 6 completely
inhibited infection without toxicity, while Peptides 5 and 6 exhibited up to ~95% infection
inhibition at 6.66μM and Peptide 5 exhibited statistically significant inhibition of infection with
concentrations as low as 30nM (Figures 5-7). These data correspond to the biolayer
interferometry results showing potent inhibition of viral RBD binding to ACE2 following exposure
to SARS-BLOCK™ peptides.
SARS-CoV-2, which causes COVID-19, is a global pandemic. At the time of this writing, more
than 158,000 people have died from COVID-19 in the United States alone, and over 692,000
worldwide — corresponding to over 4.8M US and 18.2M global confirmed cases. The long-term
health consequences of SARS-CoV-2 infection in recovered individuals remain to be seen,
however include a range of sequelae from neurological to hematological, vascular,
immunological, inflammatory, renal, respiratory, and potentially even autoimmune.​1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10
These long-term effects are particularly concerning when factoring in the known
neuropsychiatric effects of SARS-CoV-1, whereby 27.1% of 233 SARS survivors exhibited
symptoms meeting diagnostic criteria for chronic fatigue syndrome 4 years after recovery.
Furthermore, 40.3% reported chronic fatigue problems and 40% exhibited psychiatric illness.​11,12
An affordable, globally deployable, room temperature stable, and repeatedly administrable
therapeutic would address many of the risks of complications across the general population,
and is urgently needed.
While numerous vaccines are in development, including Oxford’s and Moderna’s, key issues
remain in assessing the long-term immune responses to both infections and vaccination.
Additionally, the rapid spread and questionable long-term immunity towards the virus suggest

that “herd immunity” strategies will both compromise population health and result in cumulative
burden with associated long-term complications. At this time, consistent and persistent immune
response across the entire population is speculative, and vaccine approaches have a likelihood
of proving to be inadequate long-term solutions without immunomodulators and therapeutics to
offset infection. Additionally, considerations of appropriate epitope display, glycosylations, T cell
responses, antibody responses, innate immune responses, and immune evasive techniques of
the virus must be taken into account across various demographics, both with and without
vaccination.​13,14,15,16,17 An ideal therapeutic strategy must take into account the root cause of
infection, rather than attempting to treat specific downstream symptoms, given the measurable
effects of various portions of the virus on extensive and specific cascades of physiological,
intracellular and biological systems, as has been suggested with whole-interactome mass
cytometry studies.​18 ​SARS-CoV-2 has evolved numerous mechanisms for cloaking itself from
the innate and adaptive immune systems.
To create a novel “antidote-vaccine” with potential utility as a prophylactic, immune-stimulant
and therapeutic against the virus, we utilized several approaches to generate peptides modeled
off the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein receptor-binding motif (RBM). We then performed binding and
competitive association assays, as well as SARS-CoV-2 pseudotyped lentiviral infections of
ACE2-expressing cells. ​We demonstrate that SARS-BLOCK™ peptides potently reverse ACE2
binding to viral spike proteins, with as much as ~95-100% reduction in infection in cells
expressing ACE2 receptors without causing toxicity (Figures 5-7). SARS-BLOCK™ prevents
RBD binding to ACE2 (Figure 3) and binds to neutralizing antibodies with micromolar affinity
(Figure 4a - 4d). We discover that soluble ACE2 potently inhibits binding of neutralizing
antibodies (Figure 4g) to SARS-CoV-2 receptor binding domains, and that SARS-BLOCK™
peptides are also able to reverse this immune-evasive technique.
In other words, we set out to develop a technology that could 1) block infection by inhibiting
interaction of the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein with ACE2, as well as concomitant viral entry into
ACE2-expressing cells, while 2) promoting binding of the virus and SARS-BLOCK™ peptides to
neutralizing antibodies in order to stimulate a more efficacious immune response during
infection. To this end, we also directly measured the binding of RBD and ACE2 with each other,
as well as in the presence of SARS-BLOCK™ peptides (Figures 3 and 4), and discovered that
soluble ACE2 forms an “immune cloak” upon the viral spike protein RBD, occluding the virus
spike protein RBD from recognition by a potent (6nM Kd) neutralizing antibody against the RBD
(Figure 4g). We also validated that SARS-CoV-2 RBD binds to ACE2 with 2.3±0.3 nanomolar
affinity, in contrast to the whole spike protein in “open” conformation being reported to bind as
strongly as ~700 picomolar with ACE2, which we posit is a critical mechanism for immune
evasion of the virus.​19
ACE2, commonly known as the viral entry receptor for SARS-CoV-2, exists in both
membrane-bound and soluble forms. In its soluble form, ACE2 potently prevents infection of
ACE2-expressing cells ​in vitro​, causing a ~95% reduction in infection at ~333.3nM and >98%
reduction in infection at 1​μM (Figure 6b). We observe statistically significant inhibition of

bioRxiv preprint doi: https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.08.06.238915; this version posted August 6, 2020. The copyright holder for this preprint

SARS-CoV-2 pseudotyped lentiviral infections with ACE2 concentrations as low as 4nM, yet we
also determine that soluble ACE2 prevents neutralizing antibodies from binding to the spike
protein’s receptor binding domain (RBD). We posit that soluble ACE2 contributes to the immune
cloaking and immune-evasive properties of the virus ​in vivo​, essentially shielding the spike
protein in its open conformation from recognition by the adaptive immune system.
In patients with heart failure, soluble ACE2 exists in plasma concentrations of 16.6 - 41.1ng/mL
(1st and 4th quartile ranges), which corresponds to ~193 - 478pM, while some studies report
concentrations of 7.9ng/mL in acute heart failure patients and 4.8ng/mL in healthy volunteers,
which corresponds to ~92 and ~56pM, respectively.​20,21 Other studies report that male and
female patients with type 1 diabetes (~27.0 and ~21.1ng/mL soluble ACE2, respectively) with
comorbidities of diabetic nephropathy (~27.7 - 30.2ng/mL and ~19.9 - 21.5ng/mL, respectively),
and/or coronary heart disease (~35.5 and ~27.0ng/mL, respectively) had higher circulating
ACE2 concentrations than controls (~25.6ng/mL and ~20.3ng/mL, respectively), with higher
arterial stiffness and microvascular or macrovascular disease also being positively associated
with soluble ACE2 concentrations.​22
In such ranges, it’s likely that ACE2 could enhance infection ​in vivo ​due to occluding the
receptor binding domains of the S1 spike protein in open conformation, given that an individual
virus spike only takes on this “open” conformation after exposure to furin (during biosynthesis)
and TMPRSS2 (during membrane association).​23,24 Additionally, the higher concentrations of
ACE2 in patients with cardiovascular, diabetic, renal and vascular disease may further be
associated with increased pathogenicity of SARS-CoV-2. Because of ACE2’s extremely potent
binding affinity for SARS-CoV-2’s receptor binding domain, which we hypothesized would
interfere with neutralizing antibody binding to the virus, the virus may avoid detection by the
immune system as a function of soluble ACE2. SARS-CoV-2 viral titers in the blood of clinical
specimens are lower relative to bronchoalvaeolar lavage, fibrobronchoscope brush biopsy,
sputum, nasal swab, pharyngeal swab, and feces (an average of 2^4.6 reduction versus a cycle
threshold of 30 corresponding to <2.6 x 10​4 copies/mL), corresponding to ~1000 viral copies per
mL in the blood.​25
Assuming ~100 spikes per virus, this corresponds to ~100,000 possible ACE2-binding sites per
mL of blood if all spikes are in open conformation (~1.66x10​-16 M spike protein concentration in
blood). However, given that the open conformation only occurs after TMPRSS2 cleavage, the
starting position of each spike must be assumed as being closed, and likely only a fraction of
these ~100,000 sites are exposed for ACE2 or neutralizing antibody binding at any given point
in time. Therefore, a ~193 - 478pM soluble ACE2 concentration corresponds to 1.6x10​14 ​2.9x10​14 molecules/mL (greater than one-billion-fold higher concentration than occupiable sites
on the viral surface), which, when coupled to the ~720pM - 1.2nM Kd of ACE2 to the spike
protein in open conformation, suggests that SARS-CoV-2 would primarily exist with its “open”
spikes occluded by ACE2 in blood. ACE2 is predicted to bind to certain SARS-CoV-2 RBD
mutants with as little as 110 - 130pM Kd, and, importantly—when in fully “open”
conformation—the SARS-CoV-2 spike proteins exhibit comparable binding affinity to

neutralizing antibodies that compete for this same binding site.​19,26,27 This is particularly troubling
when considering the ability of ACE2 to hinder neutralizing antibody binding to this site, and that
neutralizing antibodies are a product of B cell maturation, whereby B cells must mature
antibodies and BCRs to reach single-digit nanomolar or picomolar binding affinities comparable
in strength to ACE2-spike binding. It could be reasoned that any approach or endogenous
mechanism that reduces neutralizing antibody binding to the SARS-CoV family spike proteins
would result in less persistent B cell mediated immunity.
Indeed, SARS-CoV-2’s binding affinity to ACE2 is comparable to that of even potently
neutralizing antibodies, and in our study we demonstrate that ACE2 severely abrogates
antibody binding to the spike RBD as well as serving as potent inhibitor of infection of
SARS-CoV-2 pseudotyped lentivirus in ACE2-expressing cells ​in vitro​. Therefore, ACE2 serves
both a protective function against infection and inhibitory function on immune recognition of the
virus, acting as a competitive inhibitor of neutralizing antibody recognition against the spike
protein (with binding affinities ranging from ~676pM and 33.97nM).​28
In our own studies, we found that the receptor binding domain (RBD) of SARS-CoV-2 spike
bound to ACE2 with ~2.3nM affinity, and that ACE2 could prevent association of a neutralizing
antibody with the RBD that would otherwise have a ~6nM binding affinity, even when ACE2 is
presented in fractional concentrations to RBD (Figure 4). In sum, ACE2 binding to “open”
conformation spike proteins is a viable mechanism at physiological ACE2 concentrations for
inhibiting neutralizing antibody formation and binding against the spike protein RBD, and this
bears further investigation as an ​in vivo​ neutralizing antibody avoidance technique of the virus.
The most recent spike protein mutation, D614G, seems to further increase the density of “open”
spike proteins on the surface versus the original sequence, as well as the density of spikes in
general, which notably makes this mutant likely to be more sensitive to neutralizing antibodies
versus the aspartic acid (D) containing variant, while also increasing infectivity.​29,30 In fact, the
D614G variant seems to display ~5x increased infectivity in ACE2-expressing cells with
SARS-CoV-2 pseudotyped lentiviral infection assays.​31 This likely relates to multivalent avidity
increases associated with binding to cells expressing multiple membrane-bound ACE2
receptors, as is well characterized to be the case with viruses and other multivalent surface
presentation substrates such as nanoparticles.​32,33,34 As SARS-CoV-2 and COVID19 continue to
ravage the world, it will be important to monitor the emergence and susceptibility of various
mutants to “immune cloaking” by avoidance of neutralizing antibody recognition or recognition of
the spike protein in “open” conformation, as well as any changes in avidity and affinity resulting
from mutations at the binding interface or alterations in spike protein density.
Here, after modeling key interacting motifs of the spike protein and its receptor binding domain
with ACE2 (Figure 1), we describe the simulation (Figure 2), design, synthesis and
characterization (Figures 3 and 4, Table 1) of synthetic SARS-BLOCK™ peptides designed to
block viral binding to cells expressing ACE2, prevent ACE2 association and subsequent
cloaking of the viral spike protein, and stimulate an immune response due to binding to

neutralizing antibodies and/or facilitating neutralizing antibody binding to the viral surface.
Importantly, SARS-BLOCK™ is designed to expose the spike protein for recognition by the
immune system, due to its potent inhibition of spike protein receptor binding domain (RBD) from
binding to ACE2 (Figure 3). In summary, in contrast to neutralizing antibody therapies and other
approaches that seek to target the virus, we developed a biomimetic virus decoy peptide
technology that would compete for viral binding to cells, and expose the virus for binding to
neutralizing antibodies.

Figure 1
Initially, an “align” command was utilized in PyMOL with SARS-CoV-1 bound to ACE2 (PDB ID
6CS2) in order to approximate the binding interface of the SWISS-MODEL simulated
SARS-CoV-2 (a). Selected MHC-I and MHC-II epitope regions for inclusion in Peptide 5 are
colored pink and represent P807-K835 and A1020-Y1047 in the S1 spike protein, and were
further refined by IEDB immune epitope analysis (a). Next, the receptor-binding domain of the
SARS-CoV-2 S1 spike protein was truncated from the larger structure in its bound state to
ACE2 (b). The resulting RBD structure was run through PDBePISA to determine interacting
residues, highlighted in green on ACE2 (a and b). In b, green residues on the RBD indicate
predicted thermodynamically favorable interactions between ACE2 and the S1 spike protein
RBD, yellow indicate predicted thermodynamically neutral and orange indicate predicted
thermodynamically unfavorable interactions. Cyan residues indicate the outer bounds of amino
acids used to generate SARS-BLOCK™ peptides (V433 - V511). While the predicted binding
residues did not overlap completely with subsequently empirically-validated sequences, the
stretches of amino acids reflected in our motifs accurately reflected binding behavior (whereby
N439, ​Y449​, ​Y453​, Q474, G485, ​N487​, Y495, ​Q498​, P499, and Q506 were suggested to be
critical ACE2-interfacing residues by our PDBePISA simulation, while other groups’ subsequent
mutagenesis studies determined that G446, ​Y449​, ​Y453​, L455, F456, Y473, A475, G476, E484,
F486, ​N487​, Y489, F490, Q493, G496, ​Q498​, T500, N501, G502, and Y505 are critical for
binding within the stretch of S425 - Y508).​35 In sum, these residue predictions can be assessed
as being precise, and accurate to within a few amino acids of actual binding behaviors—and
represent a rapid and computationally minimalistic way to predict binding protein stretches
without a structure when sufficiently long amino acid sequences are employed. Critically, we did
not have to refine the amino acid sequences of SARS-BLOCK™ peptides to arrive at stretches
of amino acids that were not empirically validated at the time of design.

Figure 2
Peptides simulated via RaptorX were aligned with the SARS-CoV-2 binding interface of ACE2
(ACE2 in red, with PDBePISA-predicted binding interfaces in green). Shown from left to right
(top) are SARS-BLOCK™ Peptides 1 (a), 4 (b), 5 (c), and 6 (d) bound to ACE2. Of note, all
peptides exhibited two mutations introducing a disulfide bond to recreate the beta sheet
structure of the SARS-CoV-2 receptor binding motif (RBM). Otherwise, Peptides 1 and 4 utilized
the wildtype sequence, while Peptide 5 utilized MHC-I and MHC-II epitopes, and Peptide 6
utilized a GSGSG linker (white) in one of its non-ACE2-interfacing loop regions. Peptides 4, 5
and 6 exhibited additional, proprietary modifications to their sequences to facilitate appropriate
folding, while Peptide 1 lacked this modification. Taking into account the 9 possible folded states
generated for each peptide, we utilized PyMOL align commands which take into account
multiple potential conformations of each peptide and may serve as a basis for future studies
exploring more advanced molecular dynamics approaches for relaxing and simulating
intramolecular interactions at the binding interface (e). In essence, the overlay of many possible
folded states represents an electron distribution cloud of possible states that can be simulated
for the minimal interfacial free energy of binding, and this approach requires vastly fewer
computational resources than typically required for modeling binding pockets of ​de novo
peptides or protein-protein interfaces without existing interfacial structures.

Figure 3
Biolayer interferometry was used to determine dissociation constants of SARS-BLOCK™
peptides associated with dimeric ACE2, and the inhibitory effects of peptides on ACE2 binding
to RBD. All peptides exhibited potent inhibition of RBD binding to ACE2 at 10μM concentrations.
Peptides were associated with ACE2 at 1, 3 and 10μM concentrations until saturation was
observed (a-d). After peptide binding to ACE2, we measured ACE2 association of SARS-CoV-2
RBD at 35μM in the absence of peptides (e-h). Curiously, association of ACE2 with Peptide 5 at
1uM and 3uM enhanced RBD binding, while 10uM concentrations strongly abrogated binding
(g). All other peptides exhibited a dose-response-like behavior in preventing RBD binding,
including at 1 and 3μM concentrations (e,g,h). Of note, peptides were not included within the
final solution of 35μM RBD, ​meaning that this assay was more of a measure of competitive
irreversible antagonism versus IC50 determination​. Finally, we compared these results to
RBD-biotin captured on streptavidin sensor tips, and subsequently bound to monomeric ACE2
(i).

Figure 4
Biolayer interferometry was used to determine dissociation constants of SARS-BLOCK™
peptides associated with an IgG neutralizing antibody. Of note, Peptide 5 exhibited nonspecific
binding to the sensor tip (c), preventing determination of Kd against the neutralizing antibody,
and this was observed in all studies that did not utilize biotinylated substrates with biotin
blocking of the sensor surface. However, we determined single-micromolar binding affinities for
all other peptides with the neutralizing antibody (a,b,d). Next, we measured the dissociation
constant of increasing concentrations of RBD with anti-RBD neutralizing antibody (e). Finally,
117nM RBD was mixed with increasing concentrations of ACE2 prior to introduction to
immobilized neutralizing antibody, in order to demonstrate ACE2’s inhibition of neutralizing
antibody binding to the RBD (g). The IC50 of ACE2 inhibiting interaction of RBD with the
neutralizing antibody is interpolated to be ~30-35nM for ACE2 when the RBD concentration is
117nM, confirming that ACE2 binds more potently to the RBD than the neutralizing antibody
does, and that soluble ACE2 can act as a potent “cloak” against neutralizing antibody
recognition even at fractional molarities to SARS-CoV-2 spike RBDs.

Peptides 1 and 4 did not block SARS-CoV-2 spike protein pseudotyped virus infection of

Peptide 5 significantly exhibiting this blocking effect in the nanomolar range (80 nM and 30 nM,

Figure 6
Peptide 5 exhibited an IC50 in the sub-micromolar range and an IC95 of ~2.22uM. Of note, in
parallel, we observed virtually complete inhibition of SARS-CoV-2 spike protein pseudotyped
virus infection by soluble RBD and soluble ACE2 at 0.33uM, while a SARS-CoV-2 neutralizing
antibody inhibited infection to a similar extent at concentration as low as 6nM. Intriguingly, 12nM
RBD enhanced infection. (*, p < 0.05; ***, p < 0.001; unpaired student’s t-test, technical

Figure 7
Importantly, with the exceptions of 20uM dose of Peptide 5 causing cell death (and leading to
visible aggregation of the peptide in solution, due to poor aqueous solubility at this
concentration), the addition of peptides, soluble ACE2, or soluble RBD at different
concentrations did not result in statistically significant changes in cell viability in the presence of
virus, ca. 50%. The SARS-CoV-2 neutralizing antibody exhibited a statistically significant (p <
0.05) survival-enhancing effect at 166nM.

DISCUSSION
To our knowledge, this is the first instance whereby a synthetic peptide has been utilized to
block a virus from associating with cells, while also including epitopes for antibody and T cell
receptor formation. We demonstrate that SARS-BLOCK™ effectively blocks 95-100% of
infection of pseudotyped lentiviruses displaying the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein infecting
ACE2-expressing cells, and that SARS-BLOCK™ prevents association of the SARS-CoV-2
receptor binding domain (RBD) with ACE2 even at extremely high RBD concentrations (35μM).
Due to their binding to neutralizing antibodies against the RBD, SARS-BLOCK™ peptides are
also expected to enhance immune response to SARS-CoV-2 rather than blunting it. In contrast,
approaches such as ACE2-mimetic and antibody therapies are likely to reduce neutralizing
antibody response to the virus, since they coat the virus and prevent binding of the adaptive
immune system to the portion that is bound, which is the same segment of the spike protein
necessary for B cell receptor (BCR) maturation into neutralizing antibodies targeting the spike
protein RBD in its “open” conformation.
Importantly, SARS-BLOCK™ peptides are not expected to interfere in the activity of ACE2, due
to binding to the face of the enzyme that does not metabolize angiotensin II. Critically for
vaccine design and immune response promotion, these peptides are also designed to have
modular epitopes for MHC-I and MHC-II recognition, which can be customized to the haplotypes
of various patient populations, in addition to the inclusion of antibody-binding epitopes within the
peptide sequences. Promisingly, recovered COVID-19 patients form dominant CD8+ T cell
responses against a conserved set of epitopes, with 94% of 24 screened patients across 6 HLA
types exhibiting T cell responses to 1 or more dominant epitopes, and 53% of patients exhibiting
responses to all 3 dominant epitopes.​36,37 Furthermore, patients with various HLA genotypes
form MHC-I mediated responses to varying SARS-CoV-2 epitopes, and this can be predicted
with bioinformatics approaches.​38 While bioinformatic predictions of MHC loading corresponding
to various HLA genotypes do not predictively reveal which peptide sequences will or will not be
loaded, they do create a comprehensive overview of the possible state-spaces for empirical
validation. SARS-BLOCK™ peptides are designed to display modular motifs for priming clonal
expansion of selective TCR repertoires, which can be facilitated by sequencing of recovered
patient TCR repertoires, insertion into these scaffolds, and finally assessing HLA genotypes of
target populations, which we aim to assess in future studies.​39 This affords a facilitated method
for rapid vaccine and antidote design, coupling bioinformatics with structural and patient-derived
omics data to create an iterative design approach to treating infectious agents.
Our future studies will also examine the role of altered epitope presentation and multivalent
displays in creating enhanced antidote-vaccine technologies, while we demonstrate proof of
principle for antibody recognition and effective viral blockade in this current study. Notably,
using the approaches herein, we only synthesized four peptides, and all were “hit” compounds
requiring minimal compute resources to design. The synthetic nature of SARS-BLOCK™ affords
utility in tethering these peptides to a variety of multivalent substrates via click chemistry, which

include but are not limited to C60 buckminsterfullerene, single and multi-walled carbon
nanotubes, dendrimers, traditional vaccine substrates such as KLH, OVA and BSA, and the like
— though we examine the bare alkyne-terminated peptides in this study. The synthetic nature,
in silico screening, and precise conformation of these peptides allows for rapid synthesis without
traditional limitations of recombinant, live-attenuated, gene delivery system, viral vector, and/or
inactivated viral vaccine approaches. Due to the click chemistry nature of SARS-BLOCK™, it
may also serve as a drug and gene delivery carrier by modifications with electrostatic
sequences, or by click chemistry onto lipidic or other nanoparticles. We envision
SARS-BLOCK™ and future permutations of these compounds vastly facilitating the design,
development and scale-up of precise antidotes and vaccines against a variety of infectious
agents as part of broader biodefense initiatives.
SARS-BLOCK™ peptides are designed to overcome many limitations associated with antibody
therapies, ACE2-Fc therapies, and other antiviral therapeutics. Though neutralizing antibodies
may be used as “stopgap” therapeutics to prevent the progression of disease, the transient
nature of administered antibodies leaves the organism susceptible to reinfection. Furthermore,
as we demonstrate in this study, ACE2 is a potent inhibitor of neutralizing antibody binding to
the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein receptor binding domain, and this may relate to why short-lived
antibody responses are a hallmark component of SARS-CoV-1 infections in many patients,
whereby SARS-CoV-2 exhibits as much as 10-15x stronger binding to ACE2 than SARS-CoV-1
and would likely exhibit even stronger antibody maturation issues according to this
hypothesis.​40,41,42,43 Therapeutics that mimic ACE2 and shield this key epitope are likely to bias
antibody formation towards off-target sites, which could contribute to antibody-dependent
enhancement (ADE), vaccine-associated enhanced respiratory distress (VAERD), and a host of
other immunological issues upon repeat viral challenge.​44,45,46,47,48,49,50,51,52,52 With SARS-CoV-1, a
marked lack of peripheral memory B cell responses was observed in patients 6 years following
infection.​53 These key issues are also important to consider in vaccine development, as there is
precedent for enhanced respiratory disease in vaccinated animals with SARS-CoV-1.​54 Thus,
any approach that promotes a specific and neutralizing immune response, whether freestanding
or in conjunction with another vaccine approach or infection, should be considered as an
alternative to immunosuppressant and potentially off-target antibody forming approaches.
In particular, any approaches that have potential to limit endogenous antibody formation should
be carefully reconsidered, due to the viral immune-evasive techniques already spanning a
gamut of mechanisms, including but not limited to the S1 spike protein switching between
“open” and “closed” conformations, heavy glycosylation limiting accessible regions, and also the
presentation of T cell evasion due to MHC downregulation on infected cells and potential
MHC-II binding of the SARS-COV-2 spike protein limiting CD4+ T cell responses, which all may
be factors in contributing to T cell exhaustion and ineffective and/or transient antibody and
memory B cell responses in infected patients.​55,56,57,58 Indeed, severe and critically ill patients
exhibit extreme B cell activation and, presumably, antibody responses.​59,60 Yet, poor clinical
outcomes are seen, suggesting that immune evasion and/or off-target antibody formation is
dominant. The extent to which various factors individually play in contributing to these

phenomena remains poorly understood. Surely, COVID-19 presents itself as a multifactorial
disease with a cascade of deleterious effects. Also, the potential for reinfection across cohorts
of varying disease severity remains to be fully elucidated, though numerous clinical and
anecdotal reports indicate that immunity to coronaviruses is markedly short-lived, with seasonal
variations in susceptibility to reinfection with alpha- and betacoronaviruses being frequently
observed, and some antibody responses lasting for no longer than 3 months.​61 ​With
SARS-CoV-2 in particular, patients developing moderate antibody responses are seen to have
undetectable antibodies in as little as 50 days.​62 Additionally, one study on 149 recovered
individuals reported that 33% of study participants did not generate detectable neutralizing
antibodies 39 days following symptom onset, and that the majority of the cohort did not have
high neutralizing antibody activity.​63 ​In sum, any strategy that risks further contributing to these
immune-evasive properties warrants caution. An ideal therapeutic strategy should enhance
neutralizing antibody formation, not blunt it, while also preventing the virus from entering cells
and replicating. In our study, we offer clues as to the role of soluble ACE2 in abrogation
neutralizing antibody binding to the viral spike protein RBD, and a potential therapeutic solution
to this immune evasion.
Importantly, we believe that SARS-BLOCK​™ ​peptides will be useful as both antidotes and
vaccines, due to the presence of key epitopes for antibody formation, and the performance of
Peptide 5 (which exhibits one MHC-I and one MHC-II epitope) within these experiments
suggests future utility for our multifunctional scaffolds in eliciting T cell responses against
dominant viral epitopes, including ones that are not on the spike protein. The MHC-I and MHC-II
domains can be flexibly substituted to match HLA types in various populations, or pooled across
panels of peptides exhibiting multiple domains. Because SARS-BLOCK​™ mimics the virus,
rather than binding to it, and also due its its ability to displace ACE2 from cloaking the virus
spike protein, we believe that these multifunctional peptides will prove to be an effective
immune-enhancing strategy in infected patients, with additional potential to serve as a
prophylactic vaccine.
Therefore, SARS-BLOCK​™ ​peptides are an elegant solution towards preventing viral
association with ACE2 and infection, while also contributing to a decrease in soluble ACE2
shielding of the virus. The thermodynamically favorable interaction of an antibody with the virus
(~6nM kD with the neutralizing antibody we studied) versus our peptides (~1uM kD) suggests
that the peptides can dissociate ACE2, promote antibody formation against the virus during
infection, and preferentially train the immune system to eliminate the virus. Additionally,
SARS-BLOCK™ effectively blocks infection by viruses displaying SARS-CoV-2 spike proteins.
Our future studies will examine the improvements and therapeutic/vaccine utility of these
peptides when displayed multivalently versus as free peptides, as well as refinements to
structure and binding to further improve binding affinity and physiological behavior.

MATERIALS AND METHODS
SIMULATION AND DOCKING OF SARS-COV-2 SPIKE PROTEIN IN THE ABSENCE OF
STRUCTURAL DATA
In order to elucidate the binding motif of the receptor binding domain, in the absence of
structural data, it was necessary to utilize the results of prior crystallography experiments on
SARS-CoV-1 with ACE2. SWISS-MODEL was utilized to generate a SARS-CoV-2 spike protein
structure prior to the availability of Cryo-EM or X-ray crystallography data in February of
2020.​64,65,66,67,68,69
The SARS-CoV-2 spike protein structure was aligned with SARS-CoV-1 spike protein bound to
ACE2 (PDB ID 6CS2) using PyMOL (The PyMOL Molecular Graphics System, Version 2.3.5
Schrödinger, LLC.). This structure was then run through PDBePISA to determine the Gibbs free
energy (∆G) and predicted amino acid interactions between the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein and
the ACE2 receptor.​70 Upon the availability of structural data, this approach was compared and
determined to have correctly identified the stretches of amino acids necessary for binding to
ACE2.
DESIGN AND SIMULATION OF SYNTHETIC PEPTIDES MIMICKING SPIKE PROTEIN
RECEPTOR BINDING MOTIF
Following the simulation of structure and binding of the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein receptor
binding domain (RBD), a truncated receptor binding motif (RBM) was gathered. This sequence
was designed to recreate the structure of the larger protein in this motif, with key modifications
performed to facilitate beta sheet formation. These modified peptide sequences were then
simulated using RaptorX.
RaptorX is an efficient and accurate protein structure prediction software package, building
upon a powerful deep learning technique.​71,72 ​Given a sequence, RaptorX runs a homology
search tool HHblits to find its sequence homologs and build a multiple sequence alignment
(MSA), and then derives sequence profile and inter-residue coevolution information.​73
Afterwards, RaptorX feeds sequence profile and coevolution information to a very deep
convolutional residual neural network (of ~100 convolution layers) to predict inter-atom distance
(i.e., Ca-Ca, Cb-Cb and N-O distance) and inter-residue orientation distribution of the protein
under prediction. To predict inter-atom distance distribution, RaptorX discretizes the Euclidean
distance between two atoms into 47 intervals: 0-2, 2-2.4, 2.4-2.8, 2.8-3.2,..., 19.6-20, and > 20A.
To predict inter-residue orientation distribution, RaptorX discretizes the orientation angles
defined in into bins of 10 degrees.​74
Finally, RaptorX derives distance and orientation potential from the predicted distribution and
builds 3D models of the protein by minimizing the potential. Experimental validation indicates
that such a deep learning technique is able to predict correct folds for many more proteins than

ever before and outperforms comparative modeling unless proteins under prediction have very
close homologs in PDB (Protein Data Bank).
For our studies, the peptides in their 9 possible folded states were overlaid with the
SARS-CoV-2 receptor binding domain docked to ACE2 using PyMOL align commands to
approximate binding, and then exported to PDBePISA to estimate binding pockets before
synthesis and analytical characterization.
IMMUNE EPITOPE MAPPING AND INCLUSION WITHIN PEPTIDES
IEDB is a predictive epitope discovery tool for determining possible MHC-I, MHC-II, and
non-classical MHC restricted binding epitopes across various HLA genotypes.​75 We utilized
IEDB to predict key epitopes prior to clinical data emerging on various T cell receptor (TCR)
responses across populations with various HLA alleles, and compared epitopes on
SARS-CoV-1 with known immunogenicity to predicted and conserved epitopes for MHC-I and
MHC-II

SARS-CoV-2.​76
A
key
region
of
SARS-CoV-1
(LPDPLKPTKRSFIED​LLFNKVTLA​DAGFMKQYG)
was
defined
based
on
known
immunogenicity of the monovalent peptide in terms of its ability to elicit an MHC-I response and
antibody response, whereas many other peptides were only immunogenic while present
multivalently. Next, a known MHC-II domain from SARS-CoV-1 was also defined
(ASANLAAT​KMSECVLGQSKRV​DFCGKGYH). These two peptides were compared to the
stretches in SARS-CoV-2, and shown to have a high degree of homology in SARS-CoV-2, with
sequences
QILPDPSKPSKRSFIEDLLFNKVTLADAGFIK
(804-835)
and
ASANLAATKMSECVLGQSKRVDFCGKGY (1020-1047). IEDB determined that sequences
KMSECVLGQSKRV and LLFNKVLTA of SARS-CoV-2, representing MHC-II and MHC-I binding
domains for HLA-A*02:01, respectively, would be immunogenic with percentile ranks of 0.9 and
1.2, respectively. These sequences were included within a non-interfacing loop structure of
Peptide 5, whereas Peptide 4 included a GSGSG linker and Peptide 6 included the wildtype
receptor binding motif (RBM) sequence for the loop. Other epitopes may be flexibility included
within these modular stretches of Peptide 5 and homologues, representing 9- and 13-mer amino
acid sequences corresponding to MHC-I and MHC-II binding, respectively.​77,78
PEPTIDE SYNTHESIS
The best performing ​in silico p
​ eptides were synthesized via microwave-assisted solid-phase
peptide synthesis (SPSS) by a commercial manufacturer, sb-PEPTIDE (France). Mass
spectrometry was utilized to confirm the appropriate peptide molecular weights.

BIOLAYER INTERFEROMETRY
Biolayer interferometry is a label-free method for measuring the wavelength shift of incident
white light following loading of a ligand upon a sensor tip surface, and/or binding of soluble
analytes to that ligand or the sensor tip surface.​79 The wavelength shift corresponds to the
amount of analyte present, and can be used to determine dissociation constants and
competition between multiple analytes and the immobilized ligand. An Octet® RED384 biolayer
interferometer (Fortebio) was utilized with sensor tips displaying anti-human IgG Fc (AHC),
streptavidin (SA), nickel-charged tris-nitriloacetic acid (NTA), or anti-penta-his (HIS1K) in 96-well
plates. For streptavidin tips, we utilized 1mM biotin to block the surface after saturation with a
given immobilized ligand. After protocol optimization with his-tagged vs. biotin-tagged variants of
ACE2 and RBD, we determined that peptide analytes in solution exhibited nonspecific binding to
the sensor tip surface with NTA and HIS1K tips, whereas biotinylated surfaces minimized this
non-specific binding. Furthermore, ACE2-his (Sino Biological) and RBD-his (Sino Biological)
exhibited extremely weak binding to HIS1K tips, so we opted to utilize dimeric-ACE2-biotin
(UCSF) and RBD-biotin (UCSF) on SA tips, as well as neutralizing monoclonal IgG antibody
against the SARS-CoV-2 spike glycoprotein (CR3022, antibodies-online) on AHC tips for all
studies. Non-specific binding was still observed with Peptide 5 binding to a neutralizing antibody
on AHC tips, which complicated efforts of determining the Kd of the Peptide 5 analyte vs. the
neutralizing antibody ligand. All stock solutions were prepared in 1X PBS containing 0.2% BSA
and 0.02% Tween20. Next, the following ligands and analytes were studied:
1) Dimeric ACE2-biotin was immobilized on SA tips (~2.5nm capture).
a) Peptides 1, 4, 5 and 6 were introduced to immobilized ACE2 in concentrations of
1, 3 and 10μM (Figure 3a - 3d).
b) Sensor tips were removed from peptide solutions and introduced to 35μM
RBD-his (Sino Biological) (Figure 3e - 3h).
2) RBD-biotin was immobilized on SA tips (~5nm capture).
a) ACE2-his (Sino Biological) was introduced to immobilized RBD in concentrations
of 1.3, 3.9, 11.7, 35 and 105μM (Figure 3i).
3) Neutralizing IgG antibody was immobilized on AHC tips (~1nm capture).
a) Peptides 1, 4, 5 and 6 were introduced to immobilized ACE2 in concentrations of
0.37, 1.11, 3.33 and 10μM (Figure 4a - 4d).
b) RBD-his (Sino Biological) was introduced to immobilized neutralizing antibody
(CR3022, antibodies-online) in concentrations of 1, 3, 9, 27 and 81μM.
c) 117nM RBD-his (Sino Biological) was mixed with ACE2-his in concentrations of 0
(RBD-only), 2.88, 8.63, 25.9, and 77.7μM, and then introduced to immobilized
neutralizing antibody (CR3022, antibodies-online).

INFECTION OF ACE2-HEK293 WITH SARS-COV-2 SPIKE PROTEIN PSEUDOTYPED
LENTIVIRUS
ACE2-HEK293s (BPS Bioscience) were cultured and transduced in opaque 96-well white plates
(Corning®) with pseudotyped lentivirions displaying the SARS-CoV-2 spike glycoprotein (BPS
Bioscience). A neutralizing monoclonal IgG antibody against the SARS-CoV-2 spike
glycoprotein (CR3022, antibodies-online), ACE2 (Sino Biological), receptor-binding domain
(RBD) of spike glycoprotein (Sino Biological), and SARS-BLOCK​™ ​peptides (Ligandal) were
used as inhibitors of infection. Infection was quantitated via bioluminescence, and toxicity was
characterized via a trypan blue absorbance assay utilizing a Synergy™ H1 BioTek
spectrophotometer 60h following viral transduction. The cells were stained with trypan blue for
15 minutes, washed 3x with ice-cold calcium- and magnesium-containing 1x PBS, and lysed
before transfer to a clear-bottom plate for absorbance measurements as described elsewhere.​80
