Abstract
The COVID-19 pandemic has demonstrated the serious potential for novel zoonotic coronaviruses to
emerge and cause major outbreaks. The immediate animal origin of the causative virus, SARS-CoV-2,
remains unknown, a notoriously challenging task for emerging disease investigations. Coevolution with
hosts leads to specific evolutionary signatures within viral genomes that can inform likely animal origins.
We obtained a set of 650 spike protein and 511 whole genome nucleotide sequences from 225 and 187
viruses belonging to the family Coronaviridae, respectively. We then trained random forest models
independently on genome composition biases of spike protein and whole genome sequences, including
dinucleotide and codon usage biases in order to predict animal host (of nine possible categories, including
human). In hold-one-out cross-validation, predictive accuracy on unseen coronaviruses consistently
reached ~73%, indicating evolutionary signal in spike proteins to be just as informative as whole genome
sequences. However, different composition biases were informative in each case. Applying optimised
random forest models to classify human sequences of MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV revealed evolutionary
signatures consistent with their recognised intermediate hosts (camelids, carnivores), while human
sequences of SARS-CoV-2 were predicted as having bat hosts (suborder Yinpterochiroptera), supporting
bats as the suspected origins of the current pandemic. In addition to phylogeny, variation in genome
composition can act as an informative approach to predict emerging virus traits as soon as sequences are
available. More widely, this work demonstrates the potential in combining genetic resources with
machine learning algorithms to address long-standing challenges in emerging infectious diseases.

Background
The ongoing COVID-19 pandemic remains a significant public health emergency. Since the first identified
cases in China in December 2019, this outbreak of respiratory disease has developed into a global crisis,
with over 43 million cases worldwide to date (WHO, 2020). The causative virus was termed ‘severe acute
respiratory syndrome-related coronavirus 2’ (SARS-CoV-2) (Gorbalenya et al., 2020) and is a previously
unknown betacoronavirus that likely emerged through zoonotic transmission from contact with nonhuman animals (Andersen et al., 2020; Zhou et al., 2020). However, the precise origins of the current
pandemic remain inconclusive at present (Zhang and Holmes, 2020).
Two other betacoronaviruses have zoonotically emerged to cause significant human epidemics. Severe
acute respiratory syndrome-related coronavirus (SARS-CoV) emerged in China in 2002 via an intermediate
host of masked palm civets (Paguma larvata) in live animal markets (Guan et al., 2003; Song et al., 2005),
and Middle East respiratory syndrome related coronavirus (MERS-CoV) emerged in Saudi Arabia in 2012
via an intermediate host of dromedary camels (Alagaili et al., 2014; Chu et al., 2014), with considerable
evidence that both originated in bats (Anthony et al., 2017; Cui et al., 2007; Hu et al., 2015; Lau et al.,
2005). Four additional coronaviruses are known to be endemic within humans, causing mild common coldlike illness (Alphacoronavirus: Human coronaviruses 229E and NL63; Betacoronavirus: Human
coronaviruses HKU1 and OC43).
All viruses in the family Coronaviridae feature similar structural proteins, including a spike glycoprotein on
the outer viral surface. This protein attaches to host cell receptors and subsequently initiates cell entry.
While SARS-CoV-2 shows high genetic similarity to bat coronaviruses, particularly bat coronavirus RaTG13
(matching 96% sequence identity) (Zhou et al., 2020), its spike protein instead exhibits differences among
key amino acid residues of the receptor binding domain (RBD) (Andersen et al., 2020; Wan et al., 2020),
the region which directly interacts with host receptors. Based on this region, SARS-CoV-2 is predicted
through structural (Wan et al., 2020; Wrapp et al., 2020) and in vitro experimental models (Hoffmann et
al., 2020; Letko and Munster, 2020) to have highly efficient binding to the human angiotensin-converting
enzyme 2 (ACE2) receptor, a feature that has likely contributed to its efficient human-to-human
transmissibility. As the key molecular determinant of host range (Graham and Baric, 2010), adaptation of
coronavirus spike proteins therefore represents a key opportunity to further understand their host range
constraints.
Beyond selection acting at specific loci, viral adaptation can also manifest through broad-scale genomic
signatures. Viruses exhibit biased genome composition, for example, in non-uniform use of synonymous
codons (Jenkins and Holmes, 2003). Furthermore, coevolution within different hosts may indirectly lead
to selection for particular compositions, as reported for nucleotide and dinucleotide usage within avian
and human influenzaviruses (Greenbaum et al., 2008; Rabadan et al., 2006) and codon pair usage of
arboviruses within their insect vectors and mammalian hosts (Shen et al., 2015). The Coronaviridae are
no exception - different coronaviruses (including SARS-CoV-2) vary in their genome composition, with
particularly complex patterns of codon usage in spike protein coding sequences (Dilucca et al., 2020; Gu
et al., 2020), which could potentially contain important evolutionary signal regarding host origin.
Machine learning has recently gained substantial attention as a methodology in comparative modelling
of emerging diseases. These methods are capable of decomposing signal in high-dimensional genomic
information (a limitation of regression frameworks) without the need for sequence alignment. Genomic
machine learning analyses have demonstrated the ability to not only classify viruses from recurring viral
genome motifs (Randhawa et al., 2020), but also classify their broad host origins (Babayan et al., 2018;
Bartoszewicz et al., 2020; Young et al., 2020; Zhang et al., 2019). Specifically considering coronaviruses,

support vector machines and random forests have been trained on various genomic features to predict
host group, including nucleotide and dinucleotide biases (Tang et al., 2015), amino acid composition
(Qiang et al., 2020) or sequence k-mers (Li and Sun, 2018). However, previous model predictions are
mostly concentrated upon bats or humans, and few analyses explicitly address the spike protein (but see
Li and Sun, 2018). The exact potential of genome composition to predict host origin therefore remains
unclear.
We aimed to use machine learning to understand how the complex genomic signatures of coronaviruses
might predict their hosts and determine the importance of such signature in the spike protein.
Specifically, we trained random forest models on compositional biases for spike protein and whole
genome nucleotide sequences and compared their performance. A limitation of these approaches is that
model predictions can be strongly influenced by viral sampling biases and reflect virus lineage rather than
host (Di Giallonardo et al., 2017). Therefore, we undersample sequences to create balanced training data
and control for similarity between related sequences during hold-one-out validation. We demonstrate the
use of machine learning as a reliable method to estimate host origins of future novel coronaviruses in
humans and livestock.

Methods
Data extraction and processing
Spike protein or whole genome sequence data for coronaviruses were identified within GenBank, using
search terms
‘txid###[Organism:noexp] AND (spike[Title] OR "S gene"[Title] OR "S protein"[Title] OR "S
glycoprotein"[Title] OR "S1 gene"[Title] OR "S1 protein"[Title] OR "S1 glycoprotein"[Title] OR
peplomer[Title] OR peplomeric[Title] OR peplomers[Title] OR "complete genome"[Title]) NOT
(patent[Title] OR vaccine OR artificial OR construct OR recombinant[Title])’
where successive searches were conducted replacing ### with taxonomic identifiers for each species and
unranked sub-species belonging to the family Coronaviridae within the NCBI taxonomy database
(Federhen, 2012) (n = 1585 taxonomic ids total). Matching sequences were then extracted and further
filtered to exclude incomplete or truncated sequences based on a) metadata labels and b) length
restrictions, discarding any spike protein sequences < 2 kilobases (kb) and any whole genome sequences
outside a range of 20kb – 32kb. We accepted both spike protein coding sequences within whole genome
sequences and standalone complete spike protein sequences, excluding those only covering individual S1
or S2 subunits. All sequence data searching, filtering and extraction was conducted with R package
`rentrez` v1.2.2 (Winter, 2017; see also Brierley, 2020).

Host classification
For each spike protein or whole genome sequence, host names were extracted from the host organism
metadata field before being resolved to the standard NCBI taxonomy using the R package `taxizedb`
v0.1.9.93 (Chamberlain and Arendsee, 2020; see also Brierley, 2020). Host names were automatically
resolved to the highest taxonomic resolution possible and any unmatched host names were resolved
manually, discarding sequences with missing/unresolvable names.
We then constructed a new variable broadly describing host category of each sequence, defined at various
taxonomic levels: human (species Homo sapiens), camelid (family Camelidae), swine (family Suidae),
carnivore (order Carnivora), rodent (order Rodentia), and bird (class Aves). Following a previous analysis
(Babayan et al., 2018), we included two categories to represent bats (order Chiroptera): suborder
Yinpterochiroptera (families Craseonycteridae, Hipposideridae, Megadermatidae, Pteropodidae,
Rhinolophidae, and Rhinopomatidae) and suborder Yangochiroptera (all other families), based on their
evolutionary divergence (Tsagkogeorga et al., 2013) and differences in ecology and hosted viruses
(Moratelli et al., 2015; Young and Olival, 2016). Sequences not conforming to any of the above host
categories were excluded from further analysis.

Genomic feature calculation
We then calculated several features describing genome composition biases of each spike protein and
whole genome coding sequence at nucleotide, dinucleotide or codon level. Firstly, nucleotide biases were
calculated as simple proportion of A, C, G or U content. Dinucleotide biases were calculated as the ratio
of observed dinucleotide frequency to expected based on nucleotide frequency, following (Babayan et al.,
2018):

𝑑𝑥𝑦
𝐷
𝑛𝑥 𝑛𝑦
(𝑁 . 𝑁 )
where 𝑑𝑥𝑦 denotes frequency of dinucleotide 𝑥𝑦, 𝑛𝑥 and 𝑛𝑦 denote frequency of individual nucleotides
𝑥 and 𝑦, and 𝐷 denotes total dinucleotides and 𝑁 total nucleotides for length of the given sequence.
Biases were calculated separately for each dinucleotide at each position within codon reading frames (i.e.
at positions 1-2, 2-3 or 3-1) as dinucleotides spanning adjacent codons may be subject to more extreme
biases (Kunec and Osterrieder, 2016; Tulloch et al., 2014). Finally, Relative Synonymous Codon Usage
(RSCU) was also calculated for each codon including stop codons, following (Sharp and Li, 1987):

𝑐𝑖𝑗
1 𝑛𝑖
∑
𝑛𝑖 . 𝑗 𝑐𝑖𝑗
where 𝑛𝑖 denotes number of codons synonymous for amino acid 𝑖 and 𝑐𝑖𝑗 denotes frequency of 𝑗 𝑡ℎ codon
encoding for such amino acid. In total, this gave 116 genomic features for use in predictive models. The
Effective Number of codons (ENc) (Wright, 1990) was also calculated for each sequence as a summative
metric of magnitude of codon bias. All calculations for whole genomes considered nucleotide sequences
as-is rather than as-read; sequence strings duplicated by frameshifting among ORF1a and ORF1b replicase
protein were discarded to avoid disproportionate weighting in modelling analyses.

Machine learning analysis
To quantify the potential for genome composition biases to predict coronavirus host category, we used
random forests, an ensemble machine learning approach that aggregates over a large number of
individual classification tree models (Breiman, 2001). Such predictive modelling methods are often
sensitive to class imbalances in outcome variables (He and Garcia, 2009), as well as training data
composition. As several viruses (e.g. Porcine epidemic diarrhea virus) and host categories (e.g. human)
appeared highly over-represented, we therefore conducted stratified random undersampling prior to
modelling, retaining a maximum of 20 sequences per host category per virus (Supplementary Figure S1).
Zoonotic or epizootic coronavirus sequences from their novel host (i.e. SARS-CoV, SARS-CoV-2, MERS-CoV
in humans, totaling m = 9 taxonomic identifiers, full list in Supplementary Data Files; swine acute diarrhea
syndrome coronavirus in swine) were held out from model training as their evolutionary signature in
genome composition is much more likely to instead reflect the original or donor host, having experienced
comparatively little coevolution within the novel host following cross-species transmission. We also
excluded human enteric coronavirus, the zoonotic potential of which remains unclear.
All random forests were constructed using 1000 trees and implemented using R package `ranger`, v0.12.1
(Wright and Ziegler, 2017). Model parameters were optimized within an inner loop of 10-fold crossvalidation (Supplementary Figure S1), retaining the parameter set yielding the highest prediction
accuracy. This approach was repeated in an outer loop through hold-one-out validation applied to
coronaviruses (Supplementary Figure S1), i.e., rather exclude a single sequence in each instance, we
exclude all sequences from a single virus to control for the similarity of genome composition within-virus.
This allows host predictions for novel viruses based on values of compositional bias, rather than indirectly
predicting host by the proxy of viral identity.

Model performance was then assessed by applying each random forest to its respective held-out
coronavirus sequences as a test set. Probabilities of host categories were obtained by dropping sequences
down each individual tree model within the random forest and averaging host category prevalence of
resulting terminal nodes (see Malley et al., 2012)). To investigate explanatory relationships between
genomic biases and hosts of coronaviruses, variable importance (calculated as relative mean decrease in
Gini impurity) and partial dependence (calculated as marginal probability of each host category)
associated with each genomic feature were averaged across all random forests. Host category predictions
were also generated for each zoonotic coronavirus sequence by averaging predicted probabilities across
all random forests to investigate model utility in application to a newly-identified human epidemic
coronavirus.
All data processing and modelling were conducted within R v4.0.0 (R Development Core Team, 2020).

Results
Genome composition across the Coronaviridae
In total, we identified n = 4960 nucleotide sequences for coronavirus spike proteins and n = 2987 whole
genome sequences that met inclusion criteria. These were undersampled to n = 650 spike protein
sequences from m = 225 coronaviruses and n = 511 whole genome sequences from m = 187 coronaviruses
for use in further analysis (Supplementary Figure S1, Supplementary Table S1), spanning 40 identified host
genera and 58 identified host species (Supplementary Data Files 1 & 2).
Broadly consistent genome composition biases were observed across the diversity of all coronavirus
sequences examined. Specifically, ACU, AGA, GGU and GUU codons were over-represented among both
coronavirus spike protein sequences and whole genomes (Figure 1). Hierarchical clustering based on RSCU
values suggested codon usage was less distinct between genera within spike protein sequences (Figure
1A) than within whole genomes (Figure 1B). However, clear separation of deltacoronaviruses was
observed for both cases, as these appeared to have less extreme biases in codon usage. This was
confirmed by ENc calculation; deltacoronaviruses had higher ENc values than other coronavirus genera
(Table 1). Considering dinucleotide biases, compositional bias was typically more extreme for
dinucleotides spanning adjacent codons, i.e. position 3-1 (Supplementary Figure S2), and the
characteristic coronavirus CpG suppression was also observed.

Patterns of host-specific predictive performance were evident during hold-one-out cross-validation.
Random forests trained on both spike protein and whole genome sequence compositional features most
easily distinguished bird, carnivore and rodent host categories (Figure 2, see also Supplementary Tables
S2 & S3). Less powerful predictive performance was obtained for livestock (i.e., swine and camelid) host
categories with these sequences often predicted as having bat (suborder Yangochiroptera) hosts,
including all MERS-CoV sequences sampled from camels.
Human host origins appeared particularly difficult to characterise, with model-predicted hosts appearing
more uncertain using spike protein features than whole genome features (Figure 2); while human
coronaviruses HKU1 and NL63 were more confidently correctly classified based on whole genomes,
human coronaviruses OC43 and 229E were more confidently misclassified as having camelid or
Yinpterochiroptera hosts. The reciprocal also only occurred using whole genomes, i.e. several camel
coronaviruses were predicted to have human hosts.

spike protein and B) whole genome composition features. Colour coding denotes model-predicted host
category. Stacks represent individual coronavirus sequences.
We then applied random forests to those sequences of zoonotic viruses sampled from humans and
excluded from model training: SARS-CoV, SARS-CoV-2, and MERS-CoV (Supplementary Figure S1,
Supplementary Data Files 3 & 4). As these viruses have experienced little coevolution following zoonotic
spillover, their genome composition signal likely gives indications about their ultimate or proximate
animal host origins. MERS-CoV was overwhelmingly predicted to have camelid hosts (Figure 3) and SARSCoV was predicted with less certainty as having carnivore hosts, consistent with the respective known
intermediate hosts of camels and palm civets (order Carnivora). Contrastingly, SARS-CoV-2 was predicted
mostly strongly to have a bat (suborder Yinpterochiroptera) host. Host predictions for zoonotic viruses
were consistent between models using spike protein and whole genome features (Figure 3).

Variable importance of random forest models
The most informative genomic features towards predicting coronavirus hosts were a mixture of
dinucleotide and codon biases (Figure 4), with dinucleotide biases appearing slightly more informative for
spike protein sequences and codon biases appearing slightly more informative for whole genome
sequence. However, predictive power of individual genomic features did not hold between spike protein
and whole genome sequences; only weak correlation was observed between ranked variable importance
from both analyses (Spearman’s rank, ρ = 0.191, p = 0.042; Figure 4, see also Supplementary Figures S4 &
S5). Partial dependence plots suggested the strongest individual discriminating feature to be GG
dinucleotides at positions 1-2; an overrepresentation of this dinucleotide within the spike protein
sequence clearly distinguished bird hosts from mammalian hosts (Supplementary Figure S4), consistent
with the greatest predictive performance for bird coronaviruses (Supplementary Table S2).

Discussion
We observe biased dinucleotide and nucleotide usage across the family Coronaviridae, and demonstrate
that these genome composition biases contain sufficient evolutionary signal such that they can predict
animal host origin. We show that training random forests on these features of spike proteins is equally as
informative as using whole genome sequences in predicting hosts of novel (i.e., unseen) coronaviruses,
with bird, carnivore and rodent viruses having the highest prediction accuracy. When applied to human
coronavirus sequences from previous epidemics (SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV), random forest model predictions
consistently represented the intermediate hosts. In the case of SARS-CoV-2, where the exact transmission
pathway remains unknown, models predicted sequences to have a bat host (suborder
Yinpterochiroptera).

Variability in genome composition
Among our dataset of 225 coronaviruses, we observed A- and U-ending codons to be overrepresented
and G- and C- ending codons to be underrepresented (Figure 1), a commonly noted trait in other studies
(Dilucca et al., 2020; Tort et al., 2020). Elsewhere, CpG dinucleotide bias has been proposed as a specific
determinant of host (and tissue) range of coronaviruses (Xia, 2020), on the basis that CpG dinucleotides
are targeted by zinc finger antiviral proteins and their suppression is therefore linked to immune evasion.
We observed consistent CpG suppression (Supplementary Figure S2) and CG dinucleotides (positions 1-2)
ranked 6th and 8th in feature importance for spike proteins and whole genomes (Figure 4), respectively.
However, spike proteins display different patterns of codon usage from other viral proteins (Gu et al.,
2020), reflected in the lack of correlation between genome composition feature importance in random
forests trained on spike proteins versus whole genomes (Figure 3, see also Supplementary Figures S4 &
S5). This indicates spike proteins contain complex and distinct evolutionary signatures indicative of hostvirus coevolution, supporting our approach in using many features beyond single dinucleotides (Pollock
et al., 2020).

Model predictions of human coronaviruses
During model validation, human hosts appeared more challenging to correctly predict than other host
types. Although the endemic human coronaviruses are common, they are also thought to have their
ultimate evolutionary origins within non-human animals (Cui et al., 2007), which may explain this
difficulty. In particular, human coronaviruses NL63 and HKU1 were more consistently predicted as having
human hosts than human coronaviruses OC43 and 229E, especially when using whole genome sequences
(Figure 2). Human coronavirus NL63 is estimated to have a more ancient common ancestor with bat
coronaviruses than 229E (Huynh et al., 2012; Pfefferle et al., 2009), implying longer coevolutionary history
within human hosts has resulted in a more consistently identifiable genomic signature.
Although several mutations of SARS-CoV-2 are becoming fixed in the population, e.g. D614G in the spike
protein (Grubaugh et al., 2020), the virus has experienced only weak purifying selection (MacLean et al.,
2020) and sequences remain extremely similar over the course of the pandemic. As such, our approach
cannot identify host adaptation “in real-time”; rather, we examine variation generated over much longer
macroevolutionary histories.
Instead, we would expect viruses that have transmitted cross-species more recently to retain the genome
composition signature of their previous hosts, having experienced little coevolution within the novel host.
Applying our finalised models to zoonotic human virus sequences may therefore give an indication of their

Human sequences of SARS-CoV were predicted to have a carnivore host, consistent with the known
intermediate host of palm civets (Paguma larvata). Much previous work has shown human and civet
SARS-CoV sequences to have high similarity, with adaptive mutations concentrated within the spike
protein (specifically, the receptor binding domain) (Graham and Baric, 2010; Guan et al., 2003; Song et al.,
2005), which may explain the stronger prediction of carnivore hosts when using spike protein sequences.
Similarly, human sequences of MERS-CoV were strongly predicted as having camelid hosts, consistent
with the intermediate host of dromedary camels. The detection of evolutionary signatures corresponding
to these intermediate hosts implies that these coronaviruses circulated in those hosts for sufficient time
for coevolution to shape genome composition before cross-species transmission to humans. For MERSCoV, camel infections have been recognised as far back as at least the 1980s (Müller et al., 2014; Sabir et
al., 2016).
The origins of SARS-CoV-2 have been heavily speculated upon since its discovery, though there remains
no compelling evidence towards the animal source of the first human infections. Our random forest
models trained on genome composition of both spike protein and whole genome sequences predicted
SARS-CoV-2 as having a bat host (suborder Yinpterochiroptera). Alignment-based and phylogenetic
approaches showed the most closely related virus to be bat coronavirus RaTG13, a virus sampled from a
horseshoe bat (Rhinolophus affinis) belonging to this suborder (Zhou et al., 2020), and more widely, the
Rhinolophidae family are the most likely ancestral hosts of the Sarbecovirus genus (Latinne et al., 2020).
While our model predictions support bats as the ultimate origin of SARS-CoV-2, the involvement of
intermediate hosts remains unclear. Although the Malayan pangolin (Manis javanica) was proposed early
in the pandemic (Liu et al., 2020; Xiao et al., 2020), recent analyses have argued there is absence of
evidence for this (Boni et al., 2020; Zhan et al., 2020). The methods used here are unable to identify
intermediate hosts without sufficient sequence availability, and lack of such from pangolins (order
Pholidota) preclude us from directly testing this hypothesis. However, selection analyses indicate SARSCoV-2 could reasonably have exhibited efficient human infectivity and human-to-human transmissibility
following direct transmission from bats (MacLean et al., 2020; Zhan et al., 2020), i.e., without strict need
for prolonged selection within an intermediate host.

Future directions
A natural comparison to these methods is phylogenetic analyses, which can estimate traits such as host
type from reconstructing viral ancestry based on sequence similarity. There is challenging confounding
between molecular characteristics and sequence similarity, i.e., variation in genome composition may
actually be predictive of viral lineage rather than host type (Di Giallonardo et al., 2017), essentially acting
as a proxy for phylogenetic relatedness. To separate these signals, phylogeny needs to be considered in
model construction (Young et al., 2020); by using a cross-validation procedure holding out individual
coronaviruses rather than individual sequences, we attempt to distinguish genomic signatures arising
from convergent evolution within specific hosts, rather than from viral similarity. A more generalised
scope of study across multiple viral families would allow holdout of entire families during cross-validation
(Young et al., 2020), further removing any phylogenetic proxy effects.
Additional challenges are created by the unavoidable, systematic gaps in sampling coverage. For example,
disproportionate sampling to identify viruses in wildlife similar to those already known to affect humans
or livestock may introduce bias to predictive models. Although we address this by undersampling, our
model predictions, particularly for zoonotic coronaviruses, are likely influenced by the range of known
viruses with available sequence data. These issues highlight the need for a careful choice of training

dataset in modelling studies, but also for wider sampling and surveillance of coronaviruses among the
wild virome (Carroll et al., 2018), especially considering their high public health risks.
Although we focus on compositional features, predictive approaches using other sequence properties
may improve more mechanistic understanding of host range. For example, amino acid composition and
physiochemical similarity between contiguous amino acid residues can predict human origin of
coronavirus spike sequences (Qiang et al., 2020). Similarly, Young et al. (2020) have recently
demonstrated the use of multiple types of genomic features in combination to predict infected hosts and
found physicochemical classification of amino acid k-mers to achieve similar predictive power to
nucleotide k-mers. More widely, hydrophobic and hydrophilic composition of host receptors shows some
predictive signal towards virus sharing (Bae and Son, 2011), hydropathy being of mechanistic importance
during virus-receptor binding, e.g. for murine coronavirus (Thackray et al., 2005). These properties could
be used as additional features and improve machine learning model-derived predictions.
This emphasises an additional key question for future modelling studies distinct from host origin - whether
genomic traits can predict the zoonotic potential of newly discovered animal coronaviruses. As this is
strongly determined by molecular mechanisms of virus-host receptor interactions (Graham and Baric,
2010), these predictions may be best inferred by model frameworks combining genomic features of both
spike proteins and host receptors.

Conclusion
By training machine learning models on genome composition across the Coronaviridae, we demonstrate
a detectable evolutionary signature predictive of host type rooted in a region of the genome that is key
to host shifts. Our random forest predictions add to the growing evidence COVID-19 ultimately originated
within bats, though further work is needed to understand the potential for intermediate hosts.
Characterising spike proteins (and by extension, their interaction with host receptors) may provide a
fruitful path to further understanding zoonosis risk among coronaviruses.
