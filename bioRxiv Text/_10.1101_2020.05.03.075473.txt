ABSTRACT

19

The severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), the causative agent of the

20

COVID-19, is spreading globally and has infected more than 3 million people. It has been

21

discovered that SARS-CoV-2 initiates the entry into cells by binding to human angiotensin-

22

converting enzyme 2 (hACE2) through the receptor binding domain (RBD) of its spike

23

glycoprotein. Hence, drugs that can interfere the SARS-CoV-2-RBD binding to hACE2 potentially

24

can inhibit SARS-CoV-2 from entering human cells. Here, based on the N-terminal helix α1 of

25

human ACE2, we designed nine short peptides that have potential to inhibit SARS-CoV-2 binding.

26

Molecular dynamics simulations of peptides in the their free and SARS-CoV-2 RBD-bound forms

27

allow us to identify fragments that are stable in water and have strong binding affinity to the SARS-

28

CoV-2 spike proteins. The important interactions between peptides and RBD are highlighted to

29

provide guidance for the design of peptidomimetics against the SARS-CoV-2.

Introduction

35

Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2, also known as 2019-nCoV)

36

caused the COVID-19, which has been declared by the World Health Organization to be a global

37

pandemic. The COVID-19 has caused over 219,000 fatalities (as of April 29th, 2020) with more

38

than 3.1 million people testing positive for the coronavirus1. The virus causes influenza-like

39

symptoms in patients with mild symptoms while severe cases are reported to develop severe lung

40

injury that leads to multi-organ failures, eventually death2–5. The rapid growth of COVID-19

41

infections all over the world requires global efforts to fight against the virus1,6.

42
43

The phylogenetic analysis revealed that the SARS-CoV-2 belongs the genus betacoronavirus and

44

possesses about 96% nucleotide sequence identity with the closest bat coronavirus RaTG13, which

45

was identified in horseshoe bats (Rhinolophus species) in 2013. It shares 79% similarities with

46

SARS-CoV genome, and its genome has 89% identity to two other bat SARS-like viruses (Bat-

47

SL-CoVZC45 and Bat-SL-CoVZXC21)7,8. Both SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 utilize the human

48

angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (hACE2) to initiate the spike protein binding and facilitate the

49

viral attachment to host cells. In vitro and in vivo studies have confirmed hACE2 as the functional

50

receptor of SARS-CoV9–14. For SARS-CoV, it has been shown that the overexpression of ACE2

51

enhances disease severity in mice infected with the virus. This revealed that ACE2-dependent

52

entry of SARS-CoV into the host cells is a critical step15. Other studies on SARS-CoV have also

53

reported that injecting SARS-CoV spike glycoproteins into mice decreased ACE2 expression

54

levels and worsened lung injury16,17. Therefore ACE2 is critical as both the entry receptor of

55

SARS-CoV and in SARS-CoV pathogenesis ACE2 protects the lungs from injury13. Given the

56

close relation between the spike proteins from SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2, the roles of hACE2

bioRxiv preprint doi: https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.05.03.075473; this version posted May 4, 2020. The copyright holder for this preprint (which

57

are crucial in the virus infection. Without affecting the ACE2 expression levels, designing

58

molecules that can interfere the virus binding to hACE2 is highly desirable in the fight against the

59

COVID-19.

60

Structural studies of SARS-CoV-2 spike glycoprotein show that the spike protein directly binds to

61

ACE2 and their binding affinity is higher than that of SARS-CoV18,19. Studies have further shown

62

that the 193-residue RBD of the SARS-CoV or SARS-CoV-2 spike protein is sufficient to bind to

63

the human ACE210,20. Based on these facts, the RBD of SARS-CoV-2 is considered a critical

64

protein model for drug development to treat the COVID-19. Recently, both computational and

65

experimental studies have reported the usage of ACE2 proteins as a method to block SARS-CoV-

66

2 entry21–23. Clinical-grade human-recombinant ACE2 was demonstrated to markedly inhibit

67

SARS-CoV-2 infections of the infected vascular organoids. The study also showed human-

68

recombinant ACE2 reduced SARS-CoV-2 recovery levels from Vero cells by a factor of >1000,

69

demonstrated to be effective in blocking virus infections22. The spike protein binding to hACE2

70

was also investigated in another study, which aims to develop molecules that interfere the binding

71

of SARS-CoV-2 RBD to hACE221. Their results showed that a 23-residue peptide (residues 21-

72

43) of hACE2 N-terminal helix was able to bind to the RBD with nanomolar affinity, comparable

73

to that of full length hACE2. They also reported that a 12-residue peptide (residues 27-38) failed

74

to bind to the SARS-CoV-2 RBD. In a computational study, a 31-residue peptide derived from

75

hACE2 with residues 22-44 and 351-357 (another critical binding site for the RBD) linked via a

76

glycine was designed. The peptide binding affinity was improved by optimizing the peptide

77

sequences through sequence substitutions23. These studies demonstrate that recombinant ACE2

78

and short peptides derived from hACE2 can provide a line of defense against SARS-CoV-2

79

infection. Furthermore, studies on SARS-COV binding with hACE2 reported that hACE2

80

fragments composed of residues 22-44 or 22-57 inhibited the binding of SARS-CoV RBD to the

81

human ACE2 with IC50 values of about 50 μM and 6 μM, respectively24, implying that the longer

82

peptide fragment of residues 22-57 had stronger binding affinity to the SARS-CoV RBD,

83

providing a more wiggle room for longer peptide design.

84

In the present work, we have designed nine peptides derived from the N-terminal helix of human

85

ACE2, the α1 helix, with various lengths (from 12 to 70 residues), with an aim to maintain the

86

direct interactions observed between the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein and hACE2 in the crystal

87

structure 11,20. These peptides, or Spike Interacting Fragments (SIFs), were modeled and simulated

88

in water and in complex with the RBD of SARS-CoV-2 spike protein. The stability and binding

89

affinities are quantified from the simulation data, providing molecular basis for the SIF design.

90

Materials and methods

91

The crystal structure of SARS-CoV2-RBD/ACE2 complex (PDB ID: 6ZLG11) was used as the

92

template to design peptides, which are subject to extensive MD simulations. Each SIF was

93

simulated in a solvent box in its free form to study the peptide structural and dynamical stability

94

in solvent. For those peptides exhibiting expected structure characteristics and high stability in

95

solution, they are modelled in complex with SARS-CoV-2 RBD to further investigate the binding

96

affinities. For all systems, parameterization and equilibration input files were prepared using the

97

CHARMM-GUI webserver25. Each system was solvated in TIP3P water and sodium chloride ions

98

to neutralize the systems to a salt concentration of 150 mM. The molecular systems were modeled

99

with the CHARMM36 force field26.

100

After energy minimization using the steepest descent algorithm, each system was equilibrated at

101

human body temperature 310.15 K, which was maintained by Nose-Hoover scheme with 1.0 ps

102

coupling constant in the NVT ensemble (constant volume and temperature) for 125.0 ps under

103

periodic boundary conditions with harmonic restraint forces applied to the complex molecules

104

(400 kJ mol−1 nm−2 on backbone and 40 kJ mol−1 nm−2 on the side chains).In the subsequent step,

105

the harmonic restraints forces were removed and the NPT ensemble were simulated at one

106

atmosphere pressure (105 Pa) and body temperature. The pressure was maintained by isotropic

107

Parrinello-Rahman barostat at 1.0 bar, with a compressibility of 4.5 × 10−5 bar−1 and coupling time

108

constant of 5.0 ps. In all simulations, a time step of 2.0 fs was used and the PME (particle mesh

109

Ewald) was applied for long-range electrostatic interactions. The van der Waals interactions were

110

evaluated within the distance cutoff of 12.0 Å. Hydrogen atoms were constrained using the LINCS

111

algorithm27. Each SIF peptide system was simulated for 300 ns and for the SARS-CoV2-RBD-SIF

112

peptide complexes, simulation trajectories of 500 ns were propagated, using the GROMACS 5.1.2

113

package28.

114

Analyses were carried out with tools in the GROMACS (such as rmsd, rmsf and do_dssp) to

115

examine the structural and dynamical properties, including the overall stability, residue and

116

general structure fluctuations through the simulations. The VMD29 and Chimera30 software were

117

used to analyze the hydrogen bonds, molecular binding interface, visualization, and to render

118

images.

122

100ns MD simulations were used to calculate MM-GBSA interaction energies. In the case of SIF-

123

RBD complex, SIF and RBD were considered as ligand and receptor respectively. Prime MM-

124

GBSA uses OPLS-AA force field and VSGB 2.0 implicit solvation model to estimate the binding

125

energy of the receptor-ligand complex. The binding energy is calculated as:

126

ΔG (bind) = Ecomplex - (Eligand + Ereceptor)

127

Where ΔG (bind) is the energy difference between the complex and sum of the energies of receptor

128

and ligand alone. Energy for complex, receptor and ligand can be further divided into molecular

129

mechanical and solvation (polar and non-polar) components.

Native interactions between SARS-CoV-2 RBD with human ACE2

134

Analysis of crystal structure of SARS-CoV-2 spike protein with human ACE2 revealed that the

135

residues of the spike RBD makes extensive interactions with the N-terminal residues of hACE2

136

(19-83) (Figure 1A). The RBD-ACE2 interface contains a mixture of charged, polar and non-polar

137

residues. We classified interactions into three types, hydrogen bonds, salt bridges and van der

138

Waals (vdW) interactions. In the crystal structure, several hydrogen bonds and salt bridges exist

139

at the interface between the RBD and hACE2. Apart from the hydrogen bonds, we also observed

140

vdW contacts that contribute to the binding of RBD to hACE2. Major interactions listed in the

SARS-Cov-2 RBD interactions with the SIFs derived from hACE2

152

Based on the crystal structure and MD simulations of RBD-hACE2 complex, we designed the

153

peptides that potentially bind to the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein by grafting the sequences from the

154

N-terminal region of the hACE2. Several fragments with lengths ranging from 12 to 70 were

155

selected for analysis (Figure 2). We analyzed all trajectories in terms of conformational changes,

156

occupancies of H-bonds, and number of contacts between RBD and SIFs. Among 9 peptides, SIF5

157

and SIF8 have been reported in previous work21. SIF5 contains residues 21-43 of hACE2, while

158

SIF8 is composed of hACE2 residues 27-38. The short SIF8 (12-residue) was reported to fail

Short peptides lose helicity in the water

164

Structural stabilities of peptide fragments in the water were analyzed based on MD simulation

results. Helical contents of all fragments are listed in Table 2. We observed that three peptide

166

fragments, SIF3, SIF4 and SIF5 (residues 19-54, 19-88 and 21-43), maintained helicity higher than

167

75% in the water. Peptides composed of residues 19-38, 19-43 and 24-42 exhibited helicity

168

between 60 and 70%. Interestingly, three short peptides 24-38, 27-38 and 27-42 lost more than 50%

169

of the helical contents in the water, as shown in Figure 3. For all designed SIFs, their interactions

170

with the spike RBD strongly depend on conformations, which were designed to be mostly helices

171

as they are in the full hACE2 protein. The SIF’s with higher helical contents are stronger

172

competitors with full hACE2 for spike protein binding (see the binding energy analysis), therefore

173

they are more likely to be drug candidates for inhibiting the binding.

185

The final conformations for the SIF/RBD complexes are shown in Figure 4 for all nine designed

186

peptides. Some peptides remained closely bound to the RBD, while some other peptides went

187

through large conformational changes, ended with different structures from helices, which are the

188

starting structures for these SIFs. We carried out quantitative analysis for these SIF’s, in both cases

189

with and without the Spike RBD of SARS-CoV-2 (Table 2). The longest peptide (SIF4), which is

190

70-residue long and has 3 helices, showed an average RMSD 2.48±0.59Å in water, with respect

191

to its conformation in the crystal structure of the full hACE2. In contrast, the peptide SIF-8 was

192

found to be unstable is solvent with average RMSD of 4.43±1.17Å, indicating large deviation from

193

its conformation in the full hACE2. Several SIF peptides (SIF3, SIF7, SIF8, and SIF9 in particular)

194

exhibited larger conformational changes when they are bound to the RBD than in the free peptide

195

forms. This observation suggests that those peptides prefer a similar helical conformation as they

196

were in the full hACE2 protein in solution, and the binding to the RBD resulted induced

197

conformational changes, which are more pronounced for shorter peptides, such as SIF8 and SIF9.

198

Under the consideration of peptide stability, longer peptides are preferred according to the

199

simulation results.

200

The SIF stability was also measured with their helicity contents in the free and bound forms (Table

201

2). The peptides SIF1 to SIF4 showed high helical contents (~80%) when they are in complex with

202

the spike protein RBD. It is interesting to observe that longer peptides tend to maintain stable helix

203

conformations (Figure 5). For example, the two longest peptides, SIF3 and SIF4, are stable in

204

helical conformations in solution as well as bound to RBD. The SIF1 and SIF2 showed enhanced

205

helical conformations when bound to spike RBD, making them potential candidates for peptide

206

drug design.

Interactions between ACE2 N-terminal fragments and the spike protein RBD open a door

210

for the design of peptidomimetics

211

MD simulations provided important information about the critical interactions between peptide

212

fragments and RBD. As discussed earlier, residues in RBD interacts with the human ACE2 N-

213

terminal domain mainly via hydrogen bonds and vdW contacts. Compared to the full hACE2, the

214

SIF3 showed stronger binding affinity, reflected in the lower binding energy (Table 3). The SIF5

215

reported in the previous study appeared as the third strongest binder to the RBD, after the SIF4.

216

The free energy calculated from the 300 ns MD simulation data of the SIF5/RBD complex is

217

consistent with the previously reported binding affinity of about 47nM for this peptide21.

218

Furthermore, the same study found that the SIF8 did not show binding activities, which can be

219

explained as the unstable helical conformation of the SIF8, which becomes the coiled

220

conformation in solution (Figure 3). Even started with the helical conformation in the bound form

221

with the SARS-CoV-2 RBD, the SIF-8 became unfolded and dissociated from the binding pocket

222

of the RBD (Figure 6). Combined with experimental data, the simulations not only provide

223

molecular explanations to observations, but also verified the design principles for the hACE2

224

derived peptides, which are good candidates for binding to spike proteins if the original secondary

225

structures of full hACE2 can be preserved.

Discussions and Conclusions

234

It is very encouraging to learn the progress in designing hACE2 derived peptides to inhibit the

235

SARS-CoV-2 spike protein binding to hACE2, such as the hACE2 fragment composed of residues

236

21-43 (SIF5 in this study) with a disassociation constant (Kd) of 47 nM21, and the engineered

237

peptide fragment (based on residues 22-44 and 351-357) that promises higher potency23. We have

238

shown that the peptides with the secondary structures as in their hACE2 protein have better chance

239

to be effective in inhibiting the hACE2 binding. Figure 7 illustrates the binding energy

240

dependency on helical contents, especially the helicity of free peptides (solid black circles in

241

Figure 7). Among the strong binders, whose binding energy are lower than -50 kcal/mol, there is

242

a shared sequence segment composed of the residues (24-39). The major difference for SIF’s with

243

stronger binding affinity compared to the common sequence in all SIF’s are the residues of (24-

244

26) and (39-42) (see Figure 2), indicating the important roles of these seven residues for the

245

stability and binding affinity for the hACE2 derived peptides. By investigating the properties of

246

free peptides and peptides in complex with the RBD, our approach ensures higher probability of

247

identifying good binders to SARS-CoV-2 RBD. We also demonstrated that the secondary structure

248

preservation and stability in solvent can be probed via MD simulation methods.

Figure 7. The helical contents and the binding energy are strongly correlated.

251

SARS-CoV-2 utilizes its spike proteins to gain entry to human cells. The RBD of spike protein is

252

known to interact with the human ACE2 receptor. Hence the disruption of interaction between

253

RBD and ACE2 is an attractive therapeutic option for the treatment of SARS-CoV-2 related

254

disease. In present study, we have identified peptide fragments from the N-terminal region of

255

human ACE2 and investigated their interactions with the spike RBD. MD simulations of peptide

256

fragments with RBD provided insights into important interacting residues at the interface between

257

ACE2 and RBD. We analyzed the conformational stabilities of peptide fragments in water. Three

258

peptide fragments, SIF6, SIF8 and SIF9 appeared to be unstable in water and also showed weak

259

binding with RBD. Among all fragments, the SIF3 showed strongest binding to the RBD. MD

260

simulation data suggest that residues (24-26 and 39-42) of the ACE2 play important roles in the

261

binding of peptides to the RBD. Therefore, these residues should be kept when designing potent

262

peptides. Moreover, binding energies of peptides showed strong correlation with their helical

263

contents in the water. The findings may pave a way for the design of peptidomimetics against

264

SARS-CoV-2.
