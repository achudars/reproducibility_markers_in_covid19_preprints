Abstract

12

Human coronaviruses (HCoVs) are mainly associated with respiratory infections. However, there

13

is evidence that highly pathogenic HCoVs, including severe acute respiratory syndrome

14

coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) and Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS-CoV), infect the

15

gastrointestinal (GI) tract and are shed in the fecal matter of the infected individuals. These

16

observations have raised questions regarding the possibility of fecal-oral route as well as

17

foodborne transmission of SARS-CoV-2 and MERS-CoV. Studies regarding the survival of

18

HCoVs on inanimate surfaces demonstrate that these viruses can remain infectious for hours to

19

days, however, to date, there is no data regarding the viral survival on fresh produce, which is

20

usually consumed raw or with minimal heat processing. To address this knowledge gap, we

21

examined the persistence of HCoV-229E, as a surrogate for highly pathogenic HCoVs, on the

22

surface of commonly consumed fresh produce, including: apples, tomatoes and cucumbers.

23

Herein, we demonstrated that viral infectivity declines within a few hours post-inoculation (p.i)

24

on apples and tomatoes, and no infectious virus was detected at 24h p.i, while the virus persists

25

in infectious form for 72h p.i on cucumbers. The stability of viral RNA was examined by

26

droplet-digital RT-PCR (ddRT-PCR), and it was observed that there is no considerable reduction

27

in viral RNA within 72h p.i.

Introduction

33

Coronaviruses that infect humans (HCoV) belong to alpha and beta genera of the coronaviridae

34

family. Four common HCoVs (229E, OC43, HKU1, and NL63) are responsible for 10-30% of

35

common cold symptoms that can be mild to moderate

36

for the COVID-19 pandemic, is a betacoronavirus that uses angiotensin conversion enzyme 2

37

(ACE-2) for entry. ACE-2 is abundantly expressed in the epithelium of the respiratory tract as

38

well as the oral cavity, intestine and colon

39

of COVID-19 patients demonstrate gastrointestinal symptoms including nausea, vomiting,

40

diarrhea, and abdominal pain

41

50% of patients’ stool specimens (2, 11, 27, 30), and several studies have confirmed that the virus

42

detected in stool is infectious

43

observed in pediatric patients

44

productively in human enteroids and enterocytes

45

that multi-route mucosal inoculation (including oral inoculation) of African green monkeys with

46

SARS-CoV-2 results in infection in both the respiratory and gastrointestinal tract (10), and orally

47

inoculated golden Syrian hamsters develop respiratory and intestinal infection

48

these observations suggest that fecal-oral transmission of SARS-CoV-2 is possible.

49

Although the primary route of transmission for HCoVs is inhalation of contaminated respiratory

50

droplets and possible direct contact with contaminated fomites, there is concern that food could

51

also act as a vehicle of transmission if contaminated with HCoVs. Food may become

52

contaminated with HCoVs by contact with body secretions or fluids or by contact with soiled

53

hands. Also, HCoVs may become aerosolized via talking, sneezing, or coughing of food-

54

handlers and then be deposited on food surfaces. Food not only may act as a fomite, but can also

transport the virus to the potentially susceptible oral cavity and the GI tract

56

evidence that certain HCoVs including HCoV-229E and MERS can survive GI conditions

57

including low pH, digestive enzymes and bile

58

relatively high viral titre in stool and rectal swabs of the infected individuals could be explained

59

by active viral replication in the GI tract. Furthermore, fecal-oral is the main route of

60

transmission for enteric coronaviruses such as swine coronaviruses (26), canine coronaviruses (7),

61

and equine coronavirus (19) , demonstrating that these viruses are not sensitive to the GI fluids.

62

Contamination of fresh produce may result in the transmission of not only the enteric viruses that

63

are traditionally considered foodborne pathogens, but also possibly respiratory viruses such as

64

adenoviruses, coronaviruses, and influenza viruses that can infect via contact with mucosal

65

membranes {{640 O'Brien,B. 2020;}}. This is of particular concern for uncooked fruits and

66

vegetables. Additionally, food handlers infected with respiratory viruses could still pose a

67

potential health risk for food consumers, while preparing “cold foods” such as salads and

68

sandwiches

69

and on food contact surfaces.

70

Since working with SARS-CoV-2 requires biosafety level 3 laboratory containment conditions,

71

the use of surrogate HCoVs have been suggested to expand the current knowledge on

72

coronavirus survival and inactivation under various conditions

73

HCoV-229E as a surrogate virus, since it has similar physicochemical properties to the more

74

virulent HCoVs responsible for MERS and SARS (29). In this study, we examined the ability of

75

HCoV-229E to retain infectivity on the surface of select fruits and vegetables, and thus obtained

76

representative survival data that can be used to conduct risk assessments of SARS-CoV-2

77

transmission via food.

Materials and Methods

79

Cells and Viruses:

80

HCoV-229E and human embryonic lung cell line MRC-5 were obtained from the American

81

Type Culture Collection (CCL-171 and VR-740, respectively). Cells were grown at 37°C and

82

5% CO2 in culture media composed of Eagle’s minimal essential medium, supplemented with

83

0.23% (w/v) sodium bicarbonate, 500 µg/mL Penicillin-Streptomycin (ThermoFisher scientific),

84

Glutamax-1, non-essential amino acids, and foetal bovine serum (FBS) 5% (v/v).

85

Sample preparation:

86

Three different produce types were tested: Royal Gala apples, Traditional Series tomatoes and

87

English cucumbers (PLU code 4173, 4799 and 4593 respectively). Ten time points were

88

selected, in triplicates: 0h, 0.5h, 1h, 2h, 4h, 6h, 16h, 24h, 48h and 72h. Each of the produce

89

items was rinsed with water, dried with Kimwipes and disinfected with 70% ethanol. On the

90

surface of each produce item, a 5cm by 5cm square was delimited using tape. This area was

91

inoculated with 100µL of HCoV-229E (ATCC VR-740, 5×105 PFU/mL). The liquid was spread

92

using the tip of the pipette, then allowed to fully dry for 1h. After the appropriate time lapse at

93

ambient conditions (22°C; relative humidity, 30% to 40%), the surface was sampled with a

94

cotton swab, which was then placed into the MRC-5 culture media previously described

95

Samples were processed immediately after swabbing.

98

Viral quantification and survival time were determined by plaque assay using MRC-5 cells. Cells

99

were grown at 37 °C and 5% CO2 in the culture medium previously described for up to three

100

days, before being seeded, transferred into 12-well plates at a targeted concentration of 5×105

101

cells/mL and incubated to reach a confluency of 80-90%. Samples were diluted in culture

102

medium and 100µL of at least two dilutions were used in duplicate to infect the prepared plates

103

for 90 min at 35°C and 5% CO2. Plates were manually rocked every 10 min during the infection

104

phase. Cells were then washed with phosphate buffered saline (PBS) and covered with 2mL of

105

overlay media, composed of a 50/50 mix of 2× culture medium previously described and 0.5%

106

agarose. Plates were incubated at 35°C and 5% CO2 for 3-4 days. Cell monolayers were fixed

107

using 3.7% paraformaldehyde for 4-24h, freed from overlay plugs by running under tap water

108

and stained with 0.1% crystal violet for 20 min. Plaques were counted for each dilution to

109

determine the viral titre.

Determining limit of detection

111

Each produce item was artificially inoculated with a serial dilution of the viral stock in triplicate.

112

At T0, the virus was extracted and assayed by plaque assay as described above. The plaques were

113

counted for each dilution and results were analyzed to determine the highest dilutions (lowest

114

titre) for which plaques were still obtained in triplicate experiments.

Recovery rate calculation

116

The recovery efficiency was determined by calculating the ratio between the viral titre recovered

117

at T0 and the viral titre that was used to inoculate the sample.

Results

145

Recovery Efficiency from Produce

146

As shown in Table 1, the recovery efficiency of HCoV-229E from all the tested commodities is

147

well above 1%, with the highest recovery rate (10.8%) from tomatoes and the lowest (4.1%)

148

from cucumbers. The limit of detection (LOD) for each commodity is determined as the lowest

149

spiking concentration that produced plaques for all three replicates. As indicated in Table 2, the

150

LOD was approximately 125 PFU for tomatoes and apples, and 50 PFU for cucumbers.

151

Persistence of infectivity

152

We artificially inoculated the surface of apples, tomatoes and cucumbers with 5×104 PFU of

153

HCoV-229E, which is consistent with the amount of virus that is typically exhaled by an infected

154

individual

155

p.i. The change in infectious viral titre is similar in apples and tomatoes with a progressive

156

decline in infectivity up to 16h p.i. (Figure 1, Table 3). No infectious viral particles were isolated

157

from tomatoes and apples at 24 h p.i., which demonstrates that viral infectivity is reduced below

158

the LOD (i.e. >3 log reduction). However, infectious viral particles were detected on cucumbers

159

up to 72 h p.i. Within the first 4 h p.i, viral infectivity reduces over 1 log on tomatoes and apples

160

(1.18 and 1.27 log, respectively), while the reduction on cucumbers is only 0.75 log (Table 3).

161

The reduction in infectivity is less than 2 log at 24 h p.i on cucumbers and by 72 h p.i. reaches

162

approximately 2.5 log. No infectious viral particles were detected on cucumbers at 96 h p.i.

. Figure 1 shows the persistence in infectivity of HCoV-229E at RT within 72 h

163

The median decay rate of HCoV-229E on apples and tomatoes was similar at 30%/h and 34%/h

164

respectively, while the median decay rate on cucumbers was considerably lower at 7.7%/h. The

165

median half-life of the virus on apples and tomatoes was 2.3h and 2.05h respectively and the

166

median half-life on cucumbers was 9.05h (Table 4).

167

Persistence of viral RNA

168

We next set out to investigate the persistence of viral RNA on the examined produce over 72

169

h.p.i. at ambient temperature. As demonstrated in Figure 2, no drastic reduction in viral RNA

170

titre was observed over a 72h p.i. period. On apples, tomatoes, and cucumbers, viral RNA

171

decreased by approximately 0.7 log, 0.5 log, and 0.3 log, respectively compared to T0,.

172

Altogether, these observations demonstrate that viral RNA is more resistant to degradation

173

compared to viral infectivity on the surface of produce.

174

Discussion

175

To date, there is no conclusive evidence of foodborne transmission of SARS-CoV-2, however,

176

the traditional epidemiological foodborne investigation is unlikely to be employed with COVID-

177

19 patients. For example, it is unlikely that infected people are asked to recall foods that they

178

may have consumed during the period when they became infected. Without this information, any

179

association between SARS-CoV-2 and foods cannot be made, and understanding the role of

180

foodborne transmission remains elusive. Obtaining this epidemiological information would be

181

helpful for efficient contact-tracing and source-tracking as more than 54% of COVID-19 patients

182

can not recall how and where they contracted the virus (23).

183

Environmental persistence of HCoVs has been examined by different groups, who have obtained

184

contradictory results

. One study has shown that the stability of SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-

185

CoV-1 on dry surfaces at RT is similar, with no infectious virus being retrieved after 72h p.i.

186

(24)

187

days p.i. (5). Keevil and coworkers reported that HCoV-229E remains infectious for 5 days at RT

188

on a range of surface materials including glass and PVC, while it is rapidly inactivated on the

189

surface of copper alloys (28). In another study, more relevant to this work, it was shown that the

190

infectivity of HCoV-229E is completely abolished within 4 days p.i. on lettuce at 4°C

191

Recently, it was demonstrated that SARS-CoV-2 remains infectious on salmon at RT for 2 days

192

(15)

193

infectivity of HCoV-229E is reduced to below LOD followed by 24h incubation on tomatoes and

194

apples, and 96h on cucumbers.

195

At this point, we speculate that the longer survival on cucumbers compared to apples and

196

tomatoes could be partly explained by the difference in surface pH of these commodities. The

197

influence of pH on the stability of several coronaviruses has been studied and it has been shown

198

that in general, coronaviruses are more stable at near neutral pH as compared to acidic or

199

alkaline pH

200

acidic surface pH of tomatoes and apples (4.2 and 3.9, respectively), could be more suitable for

201

the survival of HCoV-229E

202

compared to apples and tomatoes (50 PFU compared with 125 PFUs, respectively). Thus, it is

203

possible that HCoV-229E remained infectious by 24 h p.i. on apples and tomatoes but the titre

204

was below the LOD. However, the decay rate on cucumbers is considerably slower compared to

205

apples and tomatoes (Figure 1 and Table 4), and the viral half-life on cucumbers is very close to

206

the viral half-life on plastic

207

to determine whether the surface of apples and tomatoes has some virucidal properties, not found

, while, Chin et al recovered infectious SARS-CoV-2 from plastic and stainless steel up to 7

.

(34)

. Herein, we only examined viral survival at ambient temperature and we have shown the

. As such, the near neutral surface pH of cucumbers (5.7), compared to the more

(1)

. It should also be noted that the LOD on cucumbers was lower

(16)

(24)

(9.05h and 9.04h, respectively). Further investigation is needed

208

on inanimate surfaces, that may lead to a more rapid viral inactivation. Thus, our results are in

209

accordance with the previous findings that HCoVs lose their infectivity within a few days on

210

inanimate surfaces at RT (22). Therefore, if produce becomes contaminated with HCoVs through

211

irrigation or contaminated hands during pre- or post-harvest, while being stored at ambient

212

temperature, the risk will be considerably reduced by the time it reaches the consumers.

213

However, if the contamination occurs at the end of the food processing chain, for example by

214

infected personnel in a restaurant setting, where the prepared food is consumed within a few

215

minutes, there is a potential risk for infection. In such scenarios, the risk of super-spreading

216

events is high as well (6, 35).

217

The persistence of viral RNA on the studied produce for several days despite the loss of

218

infectivity, can be explained by the high environmental resilience of the coronavirus shell, which

219

protects the viral genome (8).

220

It should be noted that our study involved experimental inoculation of fresh produce with HCoV-

221

229E, and thus may not be fully representative of potential natural contamination. However, the

222

infectious titre of virus used for inoculation of samples in the current study is representative of a

223

worst-case scenario, if virus was found to be present on fresh produce. Herein, we attempted to

224

address an important knowledge gap regarding the survival of human coronaviruses on fresh

225

produce at ambient temperature. Potential foodborne transmission poses important public health

226

implications and may partly explain the possible recurrence of the disease and its persistent

227

transmission. Thus, our results could support more robust decision‐making concerning risk

228

assessment for foodborne transmission of human coronaviruses.

Approximately 5×104 PFU HCoV-229E (100 µl viral stock) was applied to the tested surface and

363

incubated at ambient conditions (22°C; relative humidity, 30% to 40%). Virus was extracted and

364

assayed for infectivity at various time points as described in the text. The data represent the

365

average of three independent experiments. Error bars represent standard deviation.
