Abstract
The ongoing novel coronavirus (COVID-19) outbreak as a global public health
emergency infected by SARC-CoV-2 has caused devastating loss around the world. Currently,
a lot of diagnosis methods have been used to detect the infection. The nucleic acid (NA)
testing is reported to be the clinical standard for COVID-19 infection. Evidence shows that a
faster and more convenient method to detect in the early phase will control the spreading of
SARS-CoV-2. Here, we propose a method to detect SARC-Cov-2 infection within two hours
combined with Loop-mediated Isothermal Amplification (LAMP) reaction and nanopore
Flongle workflow. In this approach, RNA reverse transcription and nucleic acid amplification
reaction with one step in 30 minutes at 60-65°C constant temperature environment,
nanopore Flongle rapidly adapter ligated within 10 minutes. Flongle flow cell sequencing and
analysis in real-time. This method described here has the advantages of rapid amplification,
convenient operation and real-time detection which is the most important for rapid and
reliable clinical diagnosis of COVID-19. Moreover, this approach not only can be used for
SARS-CoV-2 detection but also can be extended to other respiratory viruses and pathogens.

Introduction
Until April 2020, the outbreaking COVID-19 around the world caused by SARS-CoV-2
have resulted in almost 3,000,000 infection cases and more than 200,000 deaths. Early studies
show that COVID-19 have an incubation period time when you catch a virus until your
symptoms start. During the incubation period time SARS-CoV-2 can also occur Human-ToHuman COVID-19 transmission. At this moment, there is no effective vaccine or drugs for the
COVID-19. Therefore, rapidly and conveniently diagnosis of the patients in the early phase
was supposed to the most effectively way to control the COVID-19 epidemic.
Here, we use nanopore Flongle workflow combined with LAMP reaction to propose a
faster and more convenient method to detect SARS-CoV-2 and other respiratory viruses in
two hours. LAMP amplification is a rapid, convenient, highly sensitive and specific technique
for clinical samples. Amplification reaction can be done less than 30 minutes in a friendly
environment. Nanopore Flongle is designed to be the quickest, most accessible and costefficient for real-time sequencing. We use the nanopore Flongle workflow for genome
sequencing and analysis after sequencing 30 minutes for SARS-CoV-2 identification.
This study presents a LAMP based method combined with nanopore Flongle rapid realtime sequencing workflow to detect COVID-19 as low as 3.25×10^2 copies/mL of SARSCoV-2 in both laboratory and wild-caught environment. It takes less then two hours to
diagnose the COVID-19 from the RNA isolate. In additional, it does not require highly trained
people and does not involve expensive and sophisticated equipment for amplification. In
summary, this approach can be used at the point of care by field and local personnel for the
rapid diagnosis of SARS-CoV-2 as well as the investigation of outbreaks of other respiratory
diseases in the future.

Methods
We propose a fast and efficient method (Figure 1) for the detection of COVID-19
infection and other respiratory viruses. The method described here can detect SARS-CoV-2
and Influenza B virus within two hours at a low copy to 3.25×10^2 copies/mL in a friendly

environment.
LAMP Primer Design
The species-specific genes (Suppl. Table 1) were chosen as target genes for SARS-CoV2 and Influenza B virus. All the target genes were synthesized and then cloned into a pGEMT easy vector by TsingKe (Wuhan, China). Primers for LAMP reaction were synthesized by
Invitrogen biotech (Shanghai, China). Each primer (Suppl. Figure 1) contain 6 oligonucleotides
respectively forward inner primer (FIP) 、backward inner primer (BIP)、 forward outer primer
(F3)、 backward outer primer (B3)、 loop forward primer (LF)、 loop backward primer (LB).
FIP、 BIP、 F3、 B3,、these 4 primers involve 6 independent sequences of the target region .All
primers were aligned to the published SARS-CoV-2 sequences and others respiratory using
BLAST. Results show the primers chosen were specific.
LAMP Reaction
Using Bst 2.0 DNA polymerase (NEB, M0537) by self-recycling strand displacement to
synthesize DNA. Since the plasmids were used as amplification template, the reverse
transcription (RT) can be omitted (approximately 15 minutes). The plasmids of SARS-CoV-2、
Influenza B virus target genes were equimolar pooling into one tube and diluted at
concentration of 3.25×10^4, 3.25×10^3, 1.1×10^3, 6.5×10^2, 3.25×10^2 copies/mL . All the
dilution gradient and pure water (negative control) were amplified by LAMP. A LAMP reaction
contains 2.5 µL 10X Isothermal Amplification Buffer, 1.5μL MgSO4 (100 mM), 3.5 µL dNTP Mix
(10 mM each), 1 µL Bst 2.0 DNA Polymerase (8,000 U/ml) , primers (final concentration: inner
primers 1.6 µM, outer primers 0.2 µM, loop primers 0.4 µM), 10µL target DNA sample, adjust
the volume to 25 μL with nuclease-free water. The reaction was run in a thermal cycler (65°
C, 30 minutes). The gel electrophoresis image (Suppl. Figure 2) of amplification was smear
band, which like staircases, and the longest fragment was up to 10 kb. The reaction solution
was purified by 35μL AMPure XP beads (Beckman, A63881), and quantified with Qubit®
dsDNA HS Assay Kit (Invitrogen, Q32854).
Nanopore Sequencing and Basecalling
200 ng input 3.25×10^5 copies/mL amplification products was used to construct ONT
rapid sequencing library (Oxford Nanopore, SQK-RBK004) according to the manufacturer's
instructions. 10μL total reaction mixture containing 7.5μL of purified amplification DNA and

water, 2.5μL Fragmentation mix (FRA) were added together to the reaction tube. Mix well and
incubate the reaction tube at 30°C for 1 minute and then at 80°C for 1 minute. Briefly put the
tube on ice to cool it down. The FRA is a barcoded transposome complex, which can cleave
randomly DNA and add barcoded transposase adapters to the cleavage sites. 1μL Rapid
Adapter (RAP) add to 10 μL previous reaction to attach sequencing adapter. Mix well, and
incubate the reaction for 5 minutes at room temperature. Then the nanopore library was
loaded into Flongle flowcell for real-time sequencing. The sequencing data were processed
as describe for pathogen identification after running 30 minutes.
To test the limit of detection, the amplification products of dilution gradient 3.25×10^4,
3.25 × 10^3, 1.1 × 10^3, 6.5 × 10^2, 3.25 × 10^2 copies/mL and negative control total 12
samples were constructed another barcoding library (Oxford Nanopore, SQK-RBK004) as
described above and sequenced using a PromethION flowcell to achieve more data.
At the same time of real-time sequencing basecalling is doing in the nanopore platform
with high accuracy mode by Guppy (version 3.2.10). Quality control was processed by
MinKNOW (version 3.6.5) software pipeline in the machine with reads quality value score
cutoff 7.
Detection Method
The reads after quality control called passed reads generated by the nanopore platform
was processed in real-time. We use qcat (version 1.1.0) to demultiplex the barcoding samples.
Statistical analysis of nanopore long reads sequencing data about reads length distribution,
reads count, reads score was processed with an in-house pipeline. We align nanopore long
reads to virus genome database with minimap2 (version 2.1) and use samtools (version 1.9)
to demonstrate the coverage and depth. We confirm the sample is positive or not for the
virus by count the aligned reads ratio, aligned reads count, aligned reads identity.

Result
Study design for SARS-CoV-2 detection
The study design (Figure 2) for SARS-CoV-2 detection is based on LAMP rapid
amplification of specific genes and sequenced by nanopore Flongle workflow. We use
standard plasmids of orf1ab gene, N gene from SARS-CoV-2, plasmids of HA gene, M gene
from influenza B virus as a mixed sample. Furthermore, homo sapiens GAPDH gene was
added to the mixed genes as one of the reaction controls. The amplified products of those
target genes were ligated by nanopore Flongle rapidly adapter, followed by sequencing on
nanopore Flongle workflow. For the detection sensitivity of SARS-CoV-2 identification by
LAMP reaction and different reaction times, we diluted the mixed sample to 3.25×10^4, 3.25
×10^3, 1.1×10^3, 6.5×10^2, 3.25×10^2 copies/mL and with LAMP reaction 20 minutes and
40 minutes. Total 11 dilution samples and a negative control (pure water) were prepared for
LAMP PCR amplification. In order to generate more data and improve detection sensitivity,
we barcoding the samples and pooling together for nanopore PromethION platform.
Compared with qPCR testing our method will output nucleic acid sequence from target genes
if the sample is positive. So, we can identify whether the sample is the positive or negative by
aligned reads ratio, aligned reads count, aligned coverage and identity.
To avoid amplification failure and improve the sensitivity of detection. For each microbe
we choose two genes as target gene to design primers and dilute the mixed samples to
different gradients. We choose SARS-CoV-2 (NC_045512.2), orf1ab gene region (genome
16,500 bp-18,000 bp), N gene region (genome 1 bp-1260 bp) to design LAMP primers. For
influenza B virus is HA gene (MT040795), M gene (MT040797) as target gene.
After amplification, we use nanopore Flongle workflow to generate sequences data in
real-time. This sequencing model allowed us to align the reads to the genome and process
the data in real-time, so we can identify the COVID-19 infection after sequencing in few
minutes.

LAMP Primer design and reaction for SARS-CoV-2
In order to detect the SARS-CoV-2, the species-specific genes orf1ab and N gene were
chosen as target genes after aligned to other HCOVID (Human Coronavirus) such as MERS,
SARS, OC43, HKU1 that happened to human. LAMP primers were designed by using NCBI
Primer-BLAST. The primers were aligned to other coronaviruses and published SARS-CoV-2
sequences in genebank by BLAST alignment on line in NCBI. The aligned results showed the
primers we chosen were species-specific. The Influenza B virus primers take the same
approach HA gene and M gene were chosen as target gene.

Nanopore platform sequencing and quality control
A nanopore Flongle flowcell sequencing library was prepared using 200 ng of DNA
amplification product (amplification 30 minutes) as input to SQK-RBK004 kit (Oxford
Nanopore Technology, UK). This library was sequenced on nanopore GridION device with
running 30 minutes, 1 hour, 2 hours, 12 hours for real-time analysis (Suppl. Figure 3A).
Nanopore reads were base called using Guppy (version 3.2.10) at a high accuracy mode.
Output fastq files were quality controlled by filtering reads quality value 7 called passed reads
(Suppl. Figure 3B). For running 30 minutes we got more then 2000 passed reads to detect
COVID-19, the max read length is 3038 bp, average reads length is 481 bp, mean reads
quality score is 15. After 12 hours finished sequencing total generated 27000 reads, the reads
length and quality have the same performance when sequencing 30 minutes (Suppl. Table 2).
Multiplex sequencing libraries after amplification reaction were constructed using 4.4 ng
– 200 ng of DNA (amplification 15 minutes to 30 minutes) from up to 12 samples (Table 1) as
input to SAK-RBK004 kit and barcoded individually. This library was sequenced on the
PromethION device with running 24 hours. After base calling and based quality control, we
demultiplex the barcoding libraries by using qcat (version 1.1.0) with min-score (Suppl. Figure
4) 80. The nanopore PromethION is a high-throughput sequencer compare with Nanopore
Flongle, we take more stringent barcode score to 80 when using qcat to improve
demultiplexed accuracy. The negative control (amplification 30 minutes) after demultiplexed

generate 209 reads, probably caused by nanopore barcode demultiplexed error. Compared
with other positive samples about reads count the order of magnitude is very small.

SARS-CoV-2 detection using nanopore Flongle
In order to achieve a rapid detection of COVID-19 infection, the sequenced data were
analysed in real-time. We compare the results by data sequenced time line 30 minutes, 1
hour, 2 hours, 12 hours. Minimap2 (version 2.1) was used to map the nanopore long reads
against the reference genome to count the detected reads count with aligning identity 85%.
For different running time more than 90% (Figure 3A) of the sequenced reads were aligned to
reference genome and have a high identity against the reference. Then the detected reads
(Table 2) of each time line was assigned to each target gene (Figure 3B). Aligned reads and
assigned reads show uniform performance to target species and target genes (Suppl. Figure
5).
Compared with sequencing 12 hours, sequencing 30 minutes output more than 2000
nanopore reads used to SARS-CoV-2 detection showed the same performance and results.
So, we can identify SARS-CoV-2 infection by sequencing few minutes with this method.

Sensitivity of SARS-CoV-2 identification by nanopore platform
To confirm the detection sensitivity of SARS-CoV-2 by nanopore platform, we use the
mixed sample diluted to different gradients (from 0- 3.25 ×10^4 genome copies/mL) with
different reaction time from 15 minutes to 30 minutes together a negative control total 12
samples. After amplification (Table 1) all the samples were barcoded and loaded to a
nanopore PromethION chip sequencing 24 hours.
Barcode after demultiplexing positive samples (Figure 4 )from different gradients and
reactions generate reads range from 21.2×10^3 to 505.3 ×10^3 reads. For positive samples
the detected reads of all sequenced reads ratio approach to 90%. Negative control as an
experimental control which should have no reads output, but we got 14 reads among 209

Discussion
The outbreaking COVID-19 infection by SARS-CoV-2 around the world has caused
devastating loss of economics and thousands of people died. Rapid, accurate and
convenient diagnosis for COVID-19 infection and then take a strict restrictive isolation
measures is the best way to control COVID-19 threating public health. Here, we proposed a
new method to detect SARS-CoV-2 and other respiratory viruses by using LAMP
amplification and then incorporated it into a nanopore Flongle sequencing workflow to
virus species identification within two hours from sample receipt.
Our workflow for COVID-19 and other respiratory samples detection includes DNA
depletion, microbial DNA extraction, target gene amplification, nanopore Flongle
sequencing, data analysis. We design primers for detecting orf1ab gene, N gene of SARSCoV-2 and HA gene, M gene of influenza B virus, GAPDH gene of Homo sapiens as control.
The LAMP can complete target nucleic acid amplification in 30 minutes at 60-65°C constant
temperature environment. Furthermore, products after LAMP reaction were loaded into
nanopore Flongle adpater to sequence and analysis in real-time. To confirm the LAMP have
a highly sensitivity, we dilute the samples to 3.25×10^4, 3.25×10^3, 1.1×10^3, 6.5×10^2,
3.25×10^2 copies/mL, results show that for SARS-CoV-2 N gene can be detected after
diluted to 10^1 copies/mL.
within two hours have a high sensitivity at 3.25×10^2 copies/mL. As we known LAMP
and RT-LAMP have been established for use as a highly sensitive methods for pathogen
detection also contain SARS in 2003. We combine LAMP and nanopore Flongle workflow to
detect SARS-CoV-2 in two hours.
In conclusion, we report a rapid, accurate and convenient method for COVID-19
infection detection by using LAMP amplification with nanopore Flongle workflow. The LAMP
reaction has been demonstrated to be a simple, fast, and highly sensitive method for
sequence specific viral nucleic acid detection. The nanopore Flongle workflow was designed
to offer rapid, low cost and on demand sequencing in real time. By additional barcoded

design on LAMP and individual samples , this method can be scaled to detect millions of
samples one day by using Nanopore GridION or PromethION platform. Moreover, this
method for COVID-19 rapid detection can also extend to other pathogens by additional
primer design.
