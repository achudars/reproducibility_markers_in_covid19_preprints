Abstract
Severe acute respiratory syndrome-coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), which is the cause of a present
global pandemic, infects human lung alveolar cells (hACs). Characterising the pathogenesis is crucial
for developing vaccines and therapeutics. However, the lack of models mirroring the cellular
physiology and pathology of hACs limits the study. Here, we develop a feeder-free, long-term threedimensional (3D) culture technique for human alveolar type 2 (hAT2) cells, and investigate infection
response to SARS-CoV-2. By imaging-based analysis and single-cell transcriptome profiling, we
reveal rapid viral replication and the increased expression of interferon-associated genes and proinflammatory genes in infected hAT2 cells, indicating robust endogenous innate immune response.
Further tracing of viral mutations acquired during transmission identifies full infection of individual cells
effectively from a single viral entry. Our study provides deep insights into the pathogenesis of SARSCoV-2, and the application of long-term 3D hAT2 cultures as models for respiratory diseases.

Main
Several members of the family Coronaviridae are transmitted from animals to humans and cause
severe respiratory diseases in affected individuals1. These include the severe acute respiratory
syndrome (SARS) and the Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS) coronavirus. Currently,
Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2
(SARS-CoV-2), is spreading globally2 and more than 11.8 million confirmed cases with ~542K deaths
have been reported worldwide as of 7th Jul 20203. The lung alveoli are the main target for these
emerging viruses4.

To develop strategies for efficient prevention, diagnosis, and treatment, the characteristics of new
viruses, including mechanisms of cell entry and transmission, kinetics in replication and transcription,
host reactions and genome evolution, should be accurately understood in target tissues. Although
basic molecular mechanisms in SARS-CoV-2 infection have been identified5-8, most findings have
been obtained from experiments using non-physiological cell lines9, model animals, such as
transgenic mice expressing human angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2)10, ferrets11 and golden
hamsters12, or from observation in clinical cohorts13 and/or inference from in-silico computational
methods14-16. As a consequence, we do not fully understand how SARS-CoV-2 affects human lung
tissues in the physiological state.

Development of three-dimensional (3D) stem cell-derived organotypic culture models, conventionally
called organoids, has enabled various physiologic and pathological studies using human-derived
tissues in vitro17-19. Organoid models established from induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs), or adult
stem cells in the human kidney, intestine, and airway have been used to investigate SARS-CoV-2
pathogenesis20-23. Although human alveolar type 2 cells (hereafter referred to as hAT2s) are believed
to be the ultimate target cells for SARS-CoV-2, their infection model has not previously been
introduced.

Long-term 3D culturing of hAT2s without mesenchymal niche
We have established feeder-free, 3D hAT2 organoids (hereafter referred to as hAOs; definition of
organoid is available at ref. 24) with defined factors which support molecular and functional identity of

bioRxiv preprint doi: https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.07.10.194498; this version posted July 10, 2020. The copyright holder for this preprint

hAT2 cells over multiple passages, showing substantial improvements from the previous application
of co-culture models25-27. Briefly, single-cell dissociated hAT2 cells were isolated by fluorescenceactivated cell sorting (FACS) for the hAT2 surface marker HTII-280 (CD31-CD45-EpCAM+HTII280+)25,28(Fig. 1a; Extended Data Fig. 1a). Isolated HTII-280+ cells showed higher expression of AT2
cell marker SFTPC, while HTII-280– cells revealed higher expressions of basal cell marker TP63 and
secretory cell marker SCGB1A1 (Extended Data Fig. 1b). We then plated HTII-280+ hAT2 cells into
Matrigel for 3D cultures with our expansion medium, supplemented with CHIR99021, RSPO1 (Rspondin 1), FGF7, FGF10, EGF, NOG (Noggin), and SB431542, that are known to support the growth
of human embryonic lung tip cells29. HTII-280– cells were also cultured under conditions supporting
human bronchial (airway) organoids (hereafter referred to as hBOs) that have previously been
reported30. hAOs established from single hAT2 cells grew up to 4 weeks with heterogeneous
morphology including budding-like and cystic-like structures consisting of mature AT2 cells expressing
pro-SFTPC, HTII-280, and ABCA3, as well as exhibiting uptake of Lysotracker, a fluorescent dye that
stains acidic organelles such as lamellar bodies25 (Fig. 1b and 1c). In contrast, hBOs grew quickly by
day 14 with cystic-like structures consisting of a number of airway cell types, including KRT5+TP63+
basal cells and SCGB1A1+ secretory cells, as previously reported30 (Fig. 1d and 1e). WNT activation
was identified as an essential factor for hAO formation, because no colony formation was found in the
absence of WNT activator CHIR99021 in culture (Extended Data Fig. 1c). Importantly, our culture
system allows the long-term expansion (>10 months) of hAT2s, although colony forming efficiency
varied between tissue samples and reduced at later passages (Extended Data Fig. 1d). Over
passaging via single cells, hAT2s consistently formed organoids, exhibiting SFTPC expression
following 9 months of continuous cultures, although growth began to slow, as evident by reduced
organoid size and lower forming efficiencies (Extended Data Fig. 1d and 1e). Alveolar type 1 cells
(hAT1s) expressing HOPX and PDPN were also observed during early cultures, demonstrating
differentiation capacity of hAT2 cells in our hAOs (Extended Data Fig. 1f), although later passages
exhibited loss of these cells.

Robust infection of SARS-CoV-2 into hAOs
The expressions of ACE2 and TMPRSS2, which are necessary for SARS-CoV-2 infection, were
observed in the membrane and cytoplasm of hAO cells (Fig. 1f and 1g; Extended Data Fig. 1g). We

next infected hAOs and hBOs with SARS-CoV-2 at a multiplicity of infection (MOI) of 1. The viral
particles were prepared from a patient (known as KCDC03) who was diagnosed with COVID-19 on
26th Jan, 2020, after traveling to Wuhan, China31. Vero cells were also infected as a positive control,
although this was not directly comparable to our 3D models due to different technical procedures.

Infectious virus particles increased to significant titers in hAOs (Fig. 1h-1k; Extended Data Fig. 2),
reaching maximum levels within the 1st day post infection (dpi), suggesting that full infection occurs
within 1 day from viral entry to hAOs. In hBOs, the increment of viral particles was observed as
consistent with another study32, but their titers were <100 times lower than hAOs (Fig. 1h and 1i;
Extended Data Fig. 2). In line with viral particles, the amount of the viral RNA in hAOs and in its
culture supernatant reached a plateau at 1 dpi (Fig. 1j and 1k). Although infected Vero cells exhibited
significant cytopathic effects at 1 dpi, typically cell rounding, detachment, degeneration and syncytium
formation9, SARS-CoV-2 infected hAOs and hBOs did not show prominent macroscopic pathologies
up until 10 dpi.

Structural changes of hAOs to SARS-CoV-2 infection
Immunostaining for double-stranded viral RNA (dsRNA) and nucleocapsid protein (NP) of SARSCoV-2 identified widespread viral infection in hAT2 cells co-expressing pro-SFTPC and ACE2 in
hAOs (Fig. 2a and 2b; Extended Data Fig. 3). To further determine subcellular events at a higher
resolution, transmission electron microscopic analysis was performed at 2 dpi (Fig. 2c-2l; Extended
Data Fig. 4). Most cells (~80%), containing secretory vesicles and surfactant proteins (lamellar
bodies25), showed discernible viral particles in the cytoplasm. A fraction of cells in hAOs showed
much higher viral burdens than other cells, with as many as 500 copies in the 100 nm section,
implying that >10,000 SARS-CoV-2 particles per cell. Aggregated viral proteins, which appeared as
electron-dense regions near nuclei33, were also detected (Fig. 2c). Accordingly, several key
pathogenic phenotypes were observed in the infected hAOs. Alveolar cells with enormous vacuoles
were frequently observed (Fig. 2c, 2f, 2h, 2i), similar to cytopathic signals in Zika virus34. Doublemembrane vesicles (DMVs), subcellular structures known as viral replication sites frequently seen in
the early phase of infection35,36, were observed in the vicinity of zippered endoplasmic reticulum in a
small fraction of hAO cells (Fig. 2j and 2k). Viral particles were dispersed in the cytosol (Fig. 2e) or

enclosed in the small vesicular structures (Fig. 2f and 2i). Diverse forms of viral secretion were also
observed mainly through the apical surfaces of hAT2 cells (Fig. 2g and 2l). More ultrastructural
pathologies are available at Extended Data Fig. 4 and the EMPIAR data archive (see Data
availability).

Transcriptional changes of hAOs to SARS-CoV-2 infection
From strand-specific deep RNA-sequencing, we explored gene expression changes in the infected
hAOs. Indeed, a set of human genes were differentially expressed as infection progressed (i.e., 0, 1
and 3 dpi), although most genes showed good correlations (Extended Data Fig. 5a and
Supplementary Table 1). Cytokeratin genes (including KRT16, KRT6A, KRT6B, and KRT6C), genes
involved in keratinization (including SPRR1A), cytoskeleton (including S100A2) and cell-cell adhesion
genes (including DSG3), were significantly reduced to ~2-3% in hAOs at 3 dpi (Fig 3a and 3b). Many
more genes were upregulated in the infected hAOs specifically at 3 dpi. In particular, transcription of a
broad range of interferon-stimulated genes (ISGs), known to be typically activated by type I and III
interferons37, were remarkably increased (Fig. 3a and 3b). These genes include interferon induced
protein genes (such as IFI6, IFI27, IFI44, IFI44L), interferon induced transmembrane protein genes
(such as IFITM1), interferon induced transmembrane proteins with tetratricopeptide repeats genes
(IFIT1, IFIT2, IFIT3), 2’-5’-oligoadenylate synthetase genes (OAS1, OAS2), and miscellaneous genes
known to be involved in innate cellular immunity (MX1, MX2, RSAD2, ISG15). These genes were
expressed to >20 times higher levels in hAOs at 3 dpi than at 0 dpi. Many other known ISGs also
showed moderate inductions (2-20 times) at 3 dpi, including BTS2 (~15 times), OAS3 (~11 times),
HERC5 (~15 times), HERC6 (~12 times) and USP18 (~12 times). Antiviral functions are known for
these ISGs38 including (1) inhibition of virus entry (MX genes, IFITM genes), (2) inhibition of viral
replication and translation (IFIT genes, OAS genes, ISG15, HERC5, HERC6, USP18) and (3)
inhibition of viral egress (RSAD2 and BST2). Of note, given that immune cells are absent in our
culture system, the innate immune response was completely autologous to alveolar cells, mimicking
the initial phase of SARS-CoV-2 alveolar infection. In line with the notion, innate induction of some
type I and type III interferons was observed. Of the 20 interferon genes, an interferon beta gene
(IFNB1) and three interferon lambda genes (IFNL1, IFNL2, and IFNL3) showed significant
transcriptional induction, although their absolute changes were not substantial (Fig. 3c). The surface

receptors of interferons were stably expressed in hAO cells without reference to viral infection (Fig.
3c). Downstream signalling genes of the receptors were also upregulated such as STAT1 (~3.5
times), STAT2 (~2.5 times) and their associated genes IRF1 (~2.4 times) and IRF9 (~6.4 times). Of
note, IRF1 is known to be specific to type I interferon responses39, while type I and type III ISGs are
generally overlapping 40.

In addition to ISGs, genes in the viral sensing pathway in cytosol showed increased expression in the
infected hAOs at 3 dpi, for example, DDX58 (official gene name of RIG-1, from 1.9 to 25.0 TPM),
IFIH1 (also known as MDA5, from 5.8 to 30.3 TPM), and TLR3 (Toll-like receptor 3, from 1.3 to 3.7
TPM), IRF7 (Interferon regulatory factor 7, from 4.4 to 29 TPM) and IL6 (0.6 to 2.5 at 1 dpi;
proinflammatory factor).

Notably, these transcriptional changes were much stronger in hAOs than in hBOs. In the similar
transcriptome profiling of the infected hBOs, the genes aforementioned were not significantly altered
(Supplementary Table 2 and Extended Data Fig. 5b). In addition, we identified few hBO specific
differentially expressed genes (Extended Data Fig. 5c). This finding implies cellular tropism of SARSCoV-2 viral infection.

Expression of SARS-CoV-2 genes in the infected organoids
We further analysed the viral RNA sequences obtained from the infected models. In agreement with
the plaque assay (Fig. 1h and 1i), relative transcription of SARS-CoV-2 genes plateaued by 1 dpi
(Fig. 3d), which is earlier than the host gene expression changes. Approximately 50% of the RNA
sequencing reads were mappable to the SARS-CoV-2 genome in hAOs from 1 dpi (Fig. 3d),
indicating prevailing viral gene expression in infected hAO cells as observed in Vero cells6. Of note,
the proportion of viral transcripts was much lower in the infected hBOs.

Transcripts from SARS-CoV-2 were not mapped uniformly to the viral genome sequence, but 3’
genomic regions, where canonical subgenomic RNAs are located, showed much higher read-depth in
all samples, consistent with the previous report6 (Fig. 3e). The vast majority of viral RNA sequences

produced from the infected hAOs and hBOs was in the orientation of positive-sense RNA strands
(Fig. 3e; for example, 99.98% vs 0.02% for positive- and negative-sense RNAs, respectively, from
hAO at 1 dpi). This is in good agreement with the nature of SARS-CoV-2, which is an enveloped, nonsegmented, and positive-sense RNA virus.

By cross-comparison of viral RNA sequences produced from a total of 11 infected hAOs (n=5) and
hBCs (n=6), we identified 20 viral base substitutions (Supplementary Table 3). No mutation was at
100% variant allele fraction (VAF) and exclusive to an infected sample. Instead, sequence alterations
showed a broad range of quasispecies heterogeneity in each culture (VAF ranges from 0.1% to 73.1%;
Fig. 3f), and a large proportion of the mutations (n=16; 80%) were shared by two or more infected
models (by the cut-off threshold of 0.1%). Therefore, we speculate that most of these sequence
changes were originally present in the pool of viral particles before their inoculation. Given the fact that
these viral particles were prepared from one of the earliest COVID-19 patients, our finding suggests
that mutations can accumulate in the viral genomes in a small number of rounds of viral transmissions,
and appear with dramatic changes in quasispecies abundance. A substantially higher proportion of
specific mutations in a sample may suggest a bottleneck in viral entry or stochasticity in viral replication.

Transcriptome changes at single-cell resolution
To understand transcriptional changes of the infected hAOs at a single-cell resolution, we employed
two 10X Genomics single-cell RNA-seq experiments for uninfected and infected hAOs at 3 dpi (to a
throughput of 21.3 Gb and 28.5 Gb, respectively). We captured 3,435 and 3,475 single-cells,
respectively, with 15,703 UMIs and 3,414 detectable genes per cell on average. Using a total of 6,910
single-cells, we performed unsupervised clustering using UMIs of the human origin, and identified four
distinct clusters (Fig. 4a): Cluster 1, mostly with uninfected alveolar cells (3,133 cells); Cluster 2,
mostly with airway-like cells (361 cells; Supplementary Discussion); Cluster 3, alveolar cells with
moderate levels of viral RNA transcripts (2,143 cells); and Cluster 4, cells disintegrating and likely
close to cell death (n=1,273). The cells in the experiment of infected hAOs were mostly distributed in
Cluster 3 (2,142 cells; 61.6% of infected hAOs) and Cluster 4 (1,154 cells; 33.2% of infected hAOs)
(Fig. 4b). Viral transcripts were found in the vast majority of infected hAO cells (99.9%; 3,471 out of

bioRxiv preprint doi: https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.07.10.194498; this version posted July 10, 2020. The copyright holder for this preprint

3,475 infected hAOs), validating our previous observation that most cells in the infected hAOs harbor
viral transcripts (Fig. 2). The number of viral transcripts, however, was not uniformly distributed in all
infected hAO cells, but enriched in Cluster 4 cells. Infected cells in Cluster 4 exhibited 13.7 times
more viral UMI counts than cells in Cluster 3, on average (Fig. 4c; 1,904 vs. 139 UMIs, respectively),
despite cells in Cluster 4 containing relatively lower total UMI counts than ones in Cluster 3 (5,040 vs.
17,843 UMIs, respectively). When normalised with UMI counts for human genes, cells in Cluster 4
showed a >30 times higher viral RNA burden than cells in Cluster 3 (Fig 4d). Interestingly, the
infected cells in Cluster 4 showed reduced expression of canonical hAT2 marker genes, including
SFTPB (Surfactant Protein B) and NKX2-1 (NK2 homeobox 1) (Fig. 4e; Extended Data Fig. 6a).
Compared with infected cells in Cluster 3, expression levels of ISGs, such as IFI44L and OAS3, were
also highly reduced. Instead, these cells showed transcriptional induction of apoptosis mediator,
GADD45B (growth arrest and DNA-damage-inducible, beta) and anti-apoptotic TNFAIP3 (tumor
necrosis factor, alpha-induced protein 3), suggesting a catastrophic cellular pathway operating in a
cell due to the extreme viral burdens.

Despite active protein expression (Fig. 1f and 1g; Extended Data Fig. 1g), we found 14 cells (0.4%)
showing ACE2 transcripts, 579 cells (16.7%) expressing TMPRSS2 transcripts, and 4 cells (0.1%) coexpressing both in single-cell transcriptome sequencing (Fig. 4e). These proportions are low at face
value, but are consistent with a previous observation41. Although the previous report also suggested
that ACE2 RNA expression can be stimulated as an infection-mediated response, particularly in
human airway cells, such a trend was not observed in our dataset.

Effective number of viral entry for infection of an alveolar cell
Finally, we statistically inferred the number of viral particles effectively entering each alveolar cell for
infection. Although we incubated cells at an MOI of 1 on average, it is generally not known how many
viral particles are necessary for effective infection of an alveolar cell. In an extreme scenario, one viral
particle is sufficient. Alternatively, infection may be initiated with the entry of multiple viruses. We
tracked the effective viral number of cellular entry using a mutation (NC_045512.2: 23,707C>U) as a
viral barcode. From our sequencing, the mutation was estimated to be present at 4.3% VAF in the
initial viral pool for innoculation. If the first scenario dominantly applies, the infected alveolar cells will

be dichotomized, i.e., 95.7% cells with solely wild-type virus and the rest of the cells with solely
mutant virus, exclusively. Alternatively, if multiple viruses are effectively entering a cell, a large
proportion of alveolar cells harbouring detectable mutant virus will have intermediate VAF for the
mutation. In our single-cell transcriptomes of infected hAOs, 212 cells were informative with the viral
mutation, containing at least two independent transcripts for the mutant locus. The majority of the
cells harbouring the mutant allele did not have the wild-type allele present (n=8 vs. 4 for cells showing
solely mutant allele vs mixture of the quasispecies, respectively; Fig. 4f). In a more sophisticated
statistical analysis, infection by single viral entry is estimated as >2 times more frequent than by
multiple viral entry (69% vs. 31%, respectively; Fig. 4g). Our calculation indicates that a single viral
particle is mainly responsible for SARS-CoV-2 infection in most alveolar cells, although multiple viral
entry is also possible. It may also reflect the viral interference in SARS-CoV-2 alveolar infection.

Discussion
In this study, we established conditions for optimised 3D long-term cultures of adult hAT2 cells, which
provided an essential tool for studying initial intrinsic responses of SARS-CoV-2 infection. Single
hAT2 cells were capable of self-constructing alveolus-like structures consisting of AT2 cell and
differentiated AT1 cells. Mature hAT2 cells were maintained >10 months over multiple passages
although self-renewal capacity and growth rate was reduced after 6 month in cultures. hAT1 cells
were also lost from later culture, likely due to the persistent exposure to high WNT conditions allowing
expansion of hAT2 cells over differentiation. Alteration of WNT activity in culture media (differentiation
media) may enable to induce further AT1 cell differentiation.

hAOs showed remarkable phenotypic changes in the first few days after SARS-CoV-2 innoculation.
Our single-cell transcriptome profiling identified two clusters of infected cells (Clusters 3 and 4),
suggesting a distinct switch between cell states occurring during infection. If in vivo SARS-CoV-2
infection transforms hAT2 cells into Cluster 4-like cells showing the loss of hAT2 identity, the integrity
and function of alveoli will be highly compromised. The route towards the quantum cellular change is
of significant interest to be answered in future studies. To this end, we need more single-cell RNA
sequencing from infected cells at earlier time points in combination with comprehensive highresolution imaging.

The interferon response is the first line of host antiviral defense40. Contrary to a recent report42, we
observed substantial ISGs in the alveolar cells induced by endogenously produced type I and III
interferons. However, the induction of interferon responses was seen at 3 dpi in hAO models, 1-2
days later than the timing of viral amplification at 1 dpi. The timing of ISG induction may be earlier in
vivo in concert with exogenous interferons from immune cells. For more physiological understanding,
co-culturing SARS-CoV-2 infected hAO models with immune cells obtained from the same donor will
be helpful.

In summary, our study highlights the power of feeder-free hAOs to elucidate the intrinsic responses of
tissue damage including virus infection. Our data, including high-resolution electron microscopic
images and the list of gene expression changes following infection, will be a great resource for the
biomedical community to provide a deeper characterisation of SARS-CoV-2 infection specifically
within adult hAT2 cells. We believe that our hAO models will enable more accurate and sophisticated
analyses in the very near future, especially for studying the response of viral infection within
vulnerable groups such as aged or diseased lungs, providing the opportunity to elucidate individual
patient responses to viral infection. Furthermore, our models can be applied to other techniques, such
as co-culture experiments with immune cells and robust in vitro screening of antiviral agents
applicable to alveolar cells, in addition to being applicable for the study of the basic biology of alveolar
cells as well as chronic disorders of the lung.

Methods

Human Tissues
For the establishment of human lung organoid models, human distal lung parenchymal tissues from
deidentified lungs not required for transplantation were obtained from adult donors with no
background lung pathologies from Papworth Hospital Research Tissue Bank (T02233), and
Addenbrookes Hospital (Cambridge University NHS foundations trust) under the collaboration of
Cambridge Biorepository for Translational Medicine (CBTM) project. Appropriate Human Tissue Act
(HTA) guidance was followed; For organoids used for viral infection and following analysis, human
lung tissue was obtained from patients undergoing lobectomy surgery at Seoul National University
Hospital (SNUH) with written informed consent from approval of the ethical committee (approval no.
C-1809-137-975). Organoids for infection studies were established from adjacent normal tissues in
lung cancer patients or an idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) patient.

Virus particle preparation for infection
SARS-CoV-2 viral particles known as BetaCov/Korea/KCDC03/20206,31 were used for the infection
study. The patient (KCDC03) was diagnosed with COVID-19 on January 26, 2020, after traveling to
Wuhan, China. The viral particles were prepared from Vero cells infected with MOI 0.01 and grown
under DMEM (Sigma) with 2% FBS(Gibco), 1% P/S(Gibco) for 48 hours at 37°C 5% CO2. Media was
centrifuged with 2500rpm for 25min, and supernatant without cell debris was stocked at -80°C with 4 x
106 pfu / ml.

Human lung tissue dissociation and flow cytometry
Distal lung parenchymal tissue was processed as soon as possible in order to minimize cell yield loss
and maintain cell viability. Briefly, fresh tissue was washed in cold PBS and minced into small (1 mm)
pieces with a scalpel, followed by further dissociation using pre-warmed digestion buffer containing
2U/ mL Dispase II (Sigma, Corning), 1 mg/mL Dispase/Collagenase (Sigma) and 0.1 mg/mL DNase I
(Sigma) in PBS at 37 ºC for 1 hr with agitation. Tissue cell suspensions were filtered through a 100
mM cell strainer into a 50 mL falcon tube to remove cell debris, and washed with 10 mL of DMEM

(Gibco, Thermofisher). Cells were centrifuged at 350 g for 10 min, supernatant carefully aspirated,
and cell pellet resuspended in 5 mL RBC lysis buffer for 5 min at room temperature (RT). The reaction
was quenched using 5 mL of DMEM, and the entire 10 mL of cell suspension was transferred to a 15
mL falcon tube, followed by 10 min centrifugation at 350 g. Supernatant was removed, and the cell
pellet was resuspended in 10% FBS in PBS (PF10 buffer) for counting. Cells were prepared for flow
cytometry with primary antibodies CD31-APC (Biolegend, 303116), CD45-APC (Biolegend, 368512),
EpCAM-FITC (Biolegend, 324204) and HTII-280-IgM (Terrace Biotech, TB-27AHT2-280) at 1:40 per
4 million cells for 30 min on ice. Following two washes with cold PF10 buffer and centrifugation at 350
g for 5 min, cells were stained with secondary PE goat anti-mouse IgM (eBioscience, 12-5790-81) for
HTII-280 at 1:100. Stained cells were washed with PF10 buffer, and counted using a hemocytometer
to assess dilution required for final volume. Cells were diluted at a concentration of 30 million cells/
mL and filtered through a 35 µM cell strainer into polypropylene FACS tubes. Cell sorting was
performed on an Aria III fusion (BD Biosciences) using a 100 µM nozzle, and data were analysed with
FlowJo software (Tree Star, Inc.).

In vitro organoid culture and passage
Freshly isolated HTII-280+ and HTII-280- cells derived from CD31 CD45 EpCAM+ cells of human distal

lungs were resuspended in Advanced DMEM/F12 (Thermofisher) base medium supplemented with
10 mM Hepes (Gibco), 1 U/mL Penicillin/Streptomycin (Gibco), 1 mM N-Acetylcysteine (Sigma), and
10 mM Nicotinamide (Sigma). Growth factor-reduced (GFR-) Matrigel (Corning) was added to the cell
suspension at a ratio of 1:1, and 100 µL of suspension was added to a 24-well transwell insert with a
0.4 µM pore (Corning) so that there were approximately 10 x 103 cells per insert. GFR-Matrigel was
allowed to solidify for 1 hr at 37 ºC, after which 500 µL of pre-warmed alveolar media (base media
supplemented with 1 x B27 (ThermoFisher), 10% R-SPONDIN-1 (Cambridge Stem Cell Institute
tissue culture core facility, manually produced), 50 ng/ml human EGF (Peprotech), 100 ng/ml human
FGF7/KGF (Peprotech),100 ng/ml human FGF10 (Peprotech), 100 ng/ml NOGGIN (Peprotech),10 µM
SB431542 (Tocris) and 3 µM CHIR99021 (Tocris)) was added to each lower chamber. For
assessment of the effect of Wnt activity on hAT2 culture ability, primary cultures were also established
without CHIR99021. Cultures were maintained under standard cell culture conditions (37 °C, 5%
CO2), with media changes every 2-3 days. Y-27632 (10 µM, Sigma) was added for the first 48 hr of

culture to promote cell survival. To avoid the growth of fungal and bacterial infection, 250 ng/mL
Amphotericin B and 50 µg/mL gentamicin were added to culture medium for 5 days. For culture in 48well plates, 5 x 103 cells were resuspended in 100% GFR-Matrigel, and allowed to solidify in a 20 µL
droplet per well at 37 ºC for 20 min, followed by submersion in 250 µL of pre-warmed medium.
Organoids larger than 45 µM in size were counted at day 14 of culture to assess organoid forming
efficiencies, and were either fixed and stained at day 21 for analysis, or enzymatically dissociated into
single cells for further culture without sorting. Organoid lines were passaged at different days
depending on size, with culture days varying from 21-35 days. For passaging, Matrigel was disrupted
by incubation with Dispase (Sigma) at 37 ºC for 45 min, followed by single cell-dissociation through
addition of trypLE (Gibco) for 5 min at 37 ºC. The reaction was quenched with base medium, and cells
were centrifuged at 350 x g for 5 min. Cells were resuspended in fresh GFR-Matrigel at a ratio of 5 x
103 (48-well plates) or 10 x 103 (24-well transwell inserts) cells as before. HTII-280- cells were cultured
as with HTII-280+, although with a few minor differences. Bronchial organoids (hBOs) were passaged
every 21-28 days due to accelerated growth compared with alveolar organoids (hAOs), and were
cultured in previously reported medium conditions30 with the following concentration/factor edits;
100 ng/ml human FGF10, 10% R-SPONDIN-1, 10 µM SB431542 (instead of A83-01).

Virus infection to organoids and Vero cells
For hAO and hBO, cells were recovered from Matrigel with a Recovery solution (Corning). Organoids
were sheared with 1000 p pipette tips or incubated with Accutase (Stem cell technology) at 37 °C for
5 minutes. Organoids were resuspended with each organoid’s media and were infected with virus
multiplicity of infection (MOI) of 1 for 2 hrs at 37 °C 5% CO2. After virus infection, organoids were
washed twice with Advanced DMEM/F12 with 1 U/ml Penicillin/Streptomycin, 10 mM Hepes, and 1%
Glutamax (v/v) (hereafter referred to as ADF+++) and embedded with 50 µl of GFR-Matrigel (Corning)
in 24-well plate (TPP). At least each well contained 10,000 cells. Media and cells resuspended in
ADF+++ with Matrigel were taken at indicated time points. For viral particle release inside cells, cells
were lysed by freezing at -80 °C and thawing. Live virus titers were determined by plaque assay and
viral RNA titer was calculated using qPCR. For Vero cell infection, a virus with MOI 1 was poured on
Vero cells directly, and cells with viruses were incubated for 1 hr at 37 °C 5% CO 2. After infection,
infection media was removed and cells were incubated in normal media in 37 °C 5% CO condition. All

work was performed in a Class II Biosafety Cabinet under BSL-3 conditions at Korea Center for
Disease Control (KCDC).

Immunofluorescence staining of paraffin-embedded organoids
Organoids were fixed and embedded in a paraffin block 43. Pre-cut 7 µM paraffin sections were dewaxed and rehydrated (sequential immersion in xylene, 100% EtOH, 90% EtOH, 75% EtOH, distilled
water) and either stained with hematoxylin and eosin (H&E) or immunostained. For antigen retrieval,
slides were submerged into pre-heated citrate antigen retrieval buffer (10 mM sodium citrate, pH 6.0)
and allowed to boil for 15 min. Slides were cooled in a buffer for 20 min, washed in running water for 3
min, and permeabilised with 0.3% Triton-X in PBS for 15 min. Following permeabilisation, organoid
sections were blocked for 1 hr in 5% normal donkey serum in PBS at RT, and incubated with primary
antibody mixes overnight at 4 °C at the following dilutions; rabbit pro-SFTPC (1:500, Millipore,
Ab3786), mouse anti-HTII-280 (1:500, Terrace Biotech, TB-27AHT2-280), rat anti-SCGB1A1 (1:200,
R&D systems, MAB4218), rabbit anti-KRT5 (1:500, Biolegend, 905501), mouse anti-ABCA3 (1:300,
Seven Hills Bioreagents, WRAB-ABCA3), and mouse anti-TP63 (1:500, Abcam, ab735), rabbit antiHOPX (1:200, Santa Cruz Biotechnologies, sc-30216), and sheep anti-PDPN (1:200, R&D, AF3670).
Antibodies were removed with three PBS washes, and samples were incubated with Alexa Fluorcouple secondary antibodies (1:1000, Jackson Laboratory) for 1 hr at RT. Following PBS washes,
nuclei were stained with DAPI for 5 min, slides mounted with Rapiclear (Sunjin lab), and sealed with
clear nail polish. For Lysotracker™ staining of lysosomes, live organoids in 48-well plates were
incubated in situ with 50 ng/µL of Lysotracker™ (Invitrogen, L12492), diluted in pre-warmed
expansion medium, for 1 hr at 37 °C. Lysotracker was removed, and organoid/matrigel suspension
was carefully washed for 5 min in PBS, followed by addition of fresh, pre-warmed expansion medium.
Cells were protected from light and imaged immediately using an EVOS cell imaging system.

Immunofluorescence staining of infected organoid with cryosection
Organoids were fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde (PFA) for 3 hrs at ice, and then dehydrated in PBS
with 30% sucrose (v/v) (Sigma). Organoids were embedded with optimal cutting temperature (OCT)
compound (Leica) and cut with 10 µM. Organoid section was blocked with 5% normal donkey serum
in PBS 1% triton-X (Sigma). Sections were incubated with primary antibodies overnight at 4 °C,

washed three times with PBS. Organoids were incubated host matched Alexa Fluor-couple secondary
antibodies (Jackson Laboratory) with PBS for 1.5 hr at RT. Following DAPI incubation, slides were
mounted. Antibodies were E-cadherin (R&D, AF748, 1:300), NP (Sino, 40143-MM05, 1:200), Spike
S1 protein (Sino, 10030005, 1:200), ACE2 (abcam, ab15348, 1:400), TMPRSS2 (abcam,
EPR3861,1:400)

Transmission electron microscopy
Human alveolar organoids were fixed with 2.5 % glutaraldehyde in 0.1 M PBS overnight at 4 °C

44.

Organoids were washed with PBS and post-fixed with 2% osmium tetroxide for 1.5 hr. The fixed
sample was dehydrated in graded ethanol, substituted with propylene oxide, and finally embedded in
EMbed-812 resin (EMS). Polymerization was performed at 60 °C for 24 hrs. Ultrathin (100 nm)
sections were prepared using an ultramicrotome (Leica, EM UC7). Images were captured with a
transmission electron microscope (FEI Tecnai G2 spirit TWIN, eagle 4K CCD camera) at 120kV
acceleration voltage. All work was carried out in the EM & Histology Core Facility, at the BioMedical
Research Center, KAIST.

RNA purification
For viral RNA extraction, cells were resuspended with Matrigel with media and frozen at -80 °C and
then thawed. Thawed solution was processed through the QIAamp Viral RNA Mini Kit. For mRNA
extraction, cells were recovered from Matrigel by a Recovery solution (Corning) and then centrifuged
at 300 g for 5 min at 4 °C. Cell pellets were lysed, and RNA was extracted through RNeasy Plus Mini
Kit. For viral RNA extraction from media, 140 µl of media was processed through QIAamp Viral RNA
Mini Kit.

Assessment of lung lineage transcripts by qRT-PCR
Freshly sorted HTII-280+ and HTII-280- cells were lysed with TRIzol, and RNA was extracted. RNA
was reverse transcribed using SuperScript IV (Thermo Fisher Scientific), and were assessed using
the following Taqman probes; SFTPC (Hs00951326_g1), TP63 (Hs01114115_m1), SCGB1A1
(Hs00171092_m1).

Viral RNA copy number calculation with qRT-PCR
Viral RNA samples were reverse-transcribed using SuperScript IV (Thermo Fisher Scientific). Viral N3
gene was targeted for qRT-PCR. Nucleotide sequences of the probes as below (CDC).
2019-nCoV_N3-F: 5’ GGGAGCCTTGAATACACCAAAA 3’
2019-nCoV_N3-R: 5’ TGTAGCACGATTGCAGCATTG 3’
Samples were prepared triplicate from solution. Viral RNA copy number was calculated by
comparing the standard curve of virus N3 gene. For generating the standard curve, the positive viral
RNA template was amplified with CDC designed N3 gene primers and cloned into pGEM-T Easy
vector (Promega, USA). The resultant plasmid DNA was linearized with PstI restriction enzyme and
purified with a QIAquick PCR Purification Kit (QIAGEN, Germany). Purified template was in vitro
transcribed by RiboMAX™ Large Scale RNA Production System with T7 RNA polymerase (Promega,
USA). RNA transcript was further purified with the NuceloSpin RNA Mini kit (MACHEREY-NAGEL,
Germany) and quantified with spectrophotometer at 260 nm. In vitro transcribed RNA was serially
diluted and reverse transcribed for the quantitative real time PCR45.

Live virus titer calculation with plaque assay
Matrigel was sheared with the organoid media and frozen at -80 °C once. Thaw the solution and dilute
by scale of 10. Each well containing Vero cells in 12 wells were infected with the diluted solution
respectively at 37 °C, 5% CO2 for 1 hr. After infection, remove infection media and wash the Vero
cells with PBS two times, mixed agar and Modified Eagle’s Medium (Thermofisher) were poured on
each well. When agar mixture was hardened, fix each well with 4% PFA for 3 days, and stain with
crystal violet (Sigma). When there are individual spots, the original solution’s viral titer was calculated.

Bulk RNA sequencing and data processing
Extracted cellular RNA was processed through Truseq Stranded Total RNA Gold kit, and cDNA library
was sequenced 2 x 100 bp using Hiseq 2500. Fastq file was aligned to GRCh38 with virus sequence
(NC 045512.2 from NCBI) using STAR46 and normalized RNA expression was calculated using
RSEM47. Differentially expressed genes are found from DEseq248. We obtained enriched gene sets

using in-house scripts. For mutation calling, we used Strelka249, Varscan250, and Samtools51, and
then manually checked the position through IGV52.

Single-cell RNA sequencing and data processing
Fastq file was aligned and each UMI count was calculated using Cell Ranger software provided by the
manufacturer (10X Genomics). Cells with mitochondria RNA percent < 25%, total RNA number > 200
subsets were used for downstream analysis.
Starting from the 10X gene counts, we have normalized data as follows. The 10X data includes
SARS-CoV-2 genome as an extra gene besides 19,941 human genes. For uninfected cells, such
SARS-CoV-2 gene would have zero read count, while for infected cells, the gene could account for a
large portion of total reads. One of the goals of normalisation is to remove technical difference such
as sequencing coverage before comparing gene expression levels. As our interest is to compare
expression levels between uninfected and infected cells on human genes, we have applied a
normalisation method (‘scater R package’s ‘logNormCounts’ function) to human genes as a whole set.
The method calculated a scaling factor for each cell based on total human gene count, then scaled all
genes before taking log-transformation. Using the same scaling factor learned during human gene
normalisation, SARS-CoV-2 count was also normalized. For clustering, we combined single-cell data
from infected and uninfected hAOs. Unsupervised clustering was performed using a shared nearest
neighbor (SNN) based clustering algorithm in Seurat53. Contaminated cells (< 3%) were discarded. In
house R scripts were used for more downstream analyses.

Statistical inference on the effective number of viral entry
To assess whether alveolar cells tend to be infected by a single viral particle or multiple particles, we
employed a likelihood approach. As a proof-of-concept, we assumed only two scenarios exist, one
supporting a single viral entry and the other supporting double viral entry, then aimed to estimate the
𝑟
proportion of cells with a single viral particle (𝑤). Out data consists of the observed reference (𝑛cell

𝑣
and variant (𝑛𝑐𝑒𝑙𝑙
) read counts for each of the 547 reporting at least one read at the mutation site of

NC_045512.2:23,707. Assuming a sequencing error rate (ε) of 0.1%, which will cover any Illumina
sequencing errors or misalignment, the likelihood of data given the weight supporting a single virus
scenario (𝑤) was computed as follows.

Supplementary discussion
Basal-like cells and hAT2 enrichment in single cell RNA sequencing
We observed a distinct transcriptional feature of cells in Cluster 2 which express lower levels of
canonical hAT2 marker genes, including SFTPC but detectable levels of airway marker genes, including
SOX2, TP63, KRT5, and KRT17 (Extended Data Fig. 6b). These expression patterns were not affected

by virus infection. hAT2 cells expressing airway markers such as SOX2 were seen in chronic lung
diseases such as lung cancer and idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) 54,55, representing pathologic
phenotypes of alveolar bronchiolization. A recent study also suggested the potential transition of hAT2
cells to KRT5+ basal-like cells in the context of IPF27. Given the fact that the hAOs used for our singlecell RNA sequencing study were derived from hAT2 cells isolated from adjacent normal counterparts
of lung cancer and/or IPF, it is likely that this transcriptional feature reflects the cellular status of original
tissues rather than virus-associated phenotype. This finding suggests that our hAO models maintain
the pathophysiologic features of original tissues although we used apparently normal background
regions for our hAO establishments. Further long-term tracing of changes in cellular identities and states
in response to virus infection in hAO cells will be of significant interest to understand the progression of
pathologic features and reparative mechanisms for developing therapeutic interventions.
Furthermore, from our scRNAseq analysis, most captured cells were hAT2 cells. It is likely that this
might result from the enrichment of hAT2 cells in our hAOs (P2) and the nature of fragile hAT1 cells
during the procedure of single-cell preparation for scRNAseq.
