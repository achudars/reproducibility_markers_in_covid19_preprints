Abstract: The recent outbreak of pneumonia in Wuhan, China caused by the 2019 Novel
Coronavirus (2019-nCoV) emphasizes the importance of detecting novel viruses and predicting
their risks of infecting people. In this report, we introduced the VHP (Virus Host Prediction) to
predict the potential hosts of viruses using deep learning algorithm. Our prediction suggests that
2019-nCoV has close infectivity with other human coronaviruses, especially the severe acute
respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV), Bat SARS-like Coronaviruses and the Middle East
respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV). Based on our prediction, compared to the
Coronaviruses infecting other vertebrates, bat coronaviruses are assigned with more similar
infectivity patterns with 2019-nCoVs. Furthermore, by comparing the infectivity patterns of all
viruses hosted on vertebrates, we found mink viruses show a closer infectivity pattern to 2019-nCov.
These consequences of infectivity pattern analysis illustrate that bat and mink may be two candidate
reservoirs of 2019-nCov.These results warn us to beware of 2019-nCoV and guide us to further
explore the properties and reservoir of it.
One Sentence Summary: It is of great value to identify whether a newly discovered virus has the
risk of infecting human. Guo et al. proposed a virus host prediction method based on deep learning
to detect what kind of host a virus can infect with DNA sequence as input. Applied to the Wuhan
2019 Novel Coronavirus, our prediction demonstrated that several vertebrate-infectious

coronaviruses have strong potential to infect human. This method will be helpful in future viral
analysis and early prevention and control of viral pathogens.

Main Text:
The recently outbreak of pneumonia in Wuhan, China has brought the 2019 Novel Coronavirus
(2019-nCoV) into our sight closely. The first case of unknown cause of pneumonia was found on
12 December 2019, and was later determined as a non-SARS novel coronavirus by Chinese
Center for Disease Control and Prevention (China CDC). This virus has now caused a total of 217
confirmed human infections in China and three deaths, reported by Chinese media on 20 January
2020. Yet the virus has trend to spread out of China, since one case in Thailand, one case in Japan
and two cases in Korea had been sequentially reported since 15 January 2020 (1). Most of the
patients are reported to have some link to seafood and animal market, which indicates the virus
may spread from animals (2). And the possibility of human-to-human transmission of the virus is
still under investigation. The situation is severe and it is urgent for us to have a better
understanding towards this virus for further prevention and control. Meanwhile, the outbreak of
pneumonia caused by 2019-nCoV warns us the importance of predicting the risk of novel virus
infection of human. At present, six full genomes of 2019-nCoV have been submitted on GISAID
(3) by China CDC, etc., and among them one has been released on GenBank (4) (Accession:
MN908947).
Currently there is urgent need to identify the hosts potentially infected by the 2019-nCoV viruses.
Large amounts of infectious viruses can be obtained from domesticated animals, birds, vector
animals and environments. These viruses may pose a great threat to human since lots of viruses that
are safe in animals may potentially infect human. In addition, owing to high mutation rate in viruses,
there are also non-human-infectious viruses that are originally spread in animals, but mutate to
infect human later (5). Besides, any unexpected hosts of novel viruses are also concerning.
To detect the potential host and pathogenicity of new viruses, the conventional way is based on their
sequence similarity to known viruses, by either building phylogenetic tree or blast. However, this
method seems to be rudimentary with several limitations. In fact, owing to the intrinsic
heterogeneity within genome, different sequence fragments of the novel virus may be assigned to
quite different known viruses with identical similarity by local alignment, which consequently leads
to the ambiguous predictions of the hosts of novel viruses. In addition, the routine method,
phylogenetic tree analysis, always utilizes the whole genomes assembled by shotgun reads, which is

frequently influenced by the sequencing and assembly mistakes. Moreover, when the potential hosts
of novel viruses were predicted from a phylogenetic perspective, people usually accepted the
assumption that the viruses with closer phylogenetic relationships have common hosts,
pathogenicity and infection behavior. However, this assumption has proved unsustainable, because
the abilities of infecting human are varied even within genus and most viruses are harmless to
human. For example, Betacoronavirus, a genus in Coronavirinae, containing both viruses that can
infect human, such as SARS, and viruses that are not reported to infect human, such as Rousettus bat
coronavirus HKU9.
Until now, there are several works on the identification of host of viruses, such as HostPhinder (6),
WIsH (7), which all predict hosts for bacteriophages. However they were not designed for
non-phage virus host-prediction, especially the virus causing Zoonotic diseases. To this end, we
report the prediction results of the host of 2019-nCoV using the method, VHP (Virus Host
Prediction), developed based on deep learning algorithm. The viral sequences data released before
2018 were used to build the training set, while those released after 2018 were utilized for testing.
The dataset (4) for training and testing includes genomes of all DNA viruses, coding sequences of
all RNA viruses and their host information in GenBank. In VHP’s prediction result of 2019-nCoV,
while the values reflect the infectivity, the score pattern and p-value pattern reflect the infectivity
pattern of the novel virus.
With the whole genome sequences released online, we predicted the potential hosts of 2019-nCoV,
as well as other 44 Coronaviruses in NCBI refseq (8) and four Bat SARS-like Coronaviruses in
GenBank (4). It turns out that six genomes of 2019-nCoV all have a high possibility (p-value<0.05)
to infect human (as shown in Table 1, and Table S2). Besides, most of the reported human-infective
Coronaviruses (9-14) are assigned the lowest p-values predicted by the VHP method (Table S1).
The similar probabilities of 2019-nCoV and other human Coronaviruses illustrates the high risk of
2019-nCoV. Part of the p-value results is shown in Table 1, which is ranked by the decreasing order
of the p-value for a virus to infect human.
The prediction results warn us that the 2019-nCoV have strong potential of infecting human similar
to SARS, Bat SARS-like Coronaviruses and MERS. While SARS was assigned slightly lower
p-value on “Human”, Bat SARS-like Coronaviruses were given closer p-value to 2019-nCoVs,
which indicates that 2019-nCoV is probable to be less infectious within human than SARS but as
infectious as Bat SARS-like Coronaviruses. Furthermore, we explore the reservoir of 2019-nCoVs
with its infectivity pattern. As is shown in Table S3, compared with the p-values of other host types,

“vertebrate” is given the least p-value for 2019-nCoVs predicted by VHP, which illustrates that the
reservoir of 2019-nCoV may be vertebrate. Compared to the Coronaviruses infecting other
vertebrates, Coronaviruses in bat are assigned with more similar infectivity patterns with
2019-nCoVs by VHP, which illustrates that bat is more likely to be the reservoir of 2019-nCoVs
than other known vertebrate hosts of Coronaviruses. To explore other potential reservoirs, we
scored all the available vertebrate viruses in GenBank, filtered viruses that have similar infectivity
pattern with 2019-nCoV (Table S4). Results show that detailed hosts information of the filtered
viruses include Canine, Porcine, Mink, Tortoise and Feline. By comparing the infectivity patterns of
all viruses hosted on these vertebrates, we found Mink viruses show a closer infectivity pattern to
2019-nCov and thus we inferred Mink may be another candidate infection source of 2019-nCov.
To evaluate whether 2019-nCoVs are close to SARS, Bat SARS-like Coronaviruses and MERS
genetically, we built a phylogenetic tree with the whole genome sequences of all the Coronaviruses

utilized above, which showed that 2019-nCoVs have a closer phylogenetic relationship with SARS
and Bat SARS-like Coronaviruses than other Coronaviruses (as shown in Fig. 1). In regard to
protein level, we predicted the genes of 2019-nCoVs and annotated them and we found that the
annotation results of all the six 2019-nCoV genomes are identical, including seven functional
proteins (pp1a, E2 glycoprotein precursor, hypothetical protein sars3a, matrix protein, hypothetical
protein sars6, hypothetical protein sars7a, nucleocapsid protein) verified in SARS-CoV-like
coronavirus (15). All these results illustrate the efficiency of our computational prediction and the
high risk of 2019-nCoV and guide us to have a closer look at the similarity and differences of
2019-nCoV and SARS-CoV-like Coronaviruses.
To explore the differences of 2019-nCoVs, SARS and SARS-CoV-like Coronavirus, we then
analyzed their core genes (more than 95% AAS identity) and nonsynonymous SNPs
(single-nucleotide polymorphisms) (Table S3). We found that the six 2019-nCoVs are more similar
to two Bat SARS-like Coronaviruses (MG772933 and MG772934) than SARS and other
SARS-CoV-like Coronaviruses. In addition, the core gene SNP analysis shows that
“BetaCoV/Wuhan/IVDC-HB-04” and “BetaCoV/Wuhan/IVDC-HB-05/2019” are divergent with
the other four 2019-nCoVs, which means that there may be some mistakes in sequencing and
assembly of these two viruses. By core gene and accessary gene analysis of the left four
2019-nCoVs and the two Bat SARS-like Coronaviruses, we found three core genes: two ORFs and
one functional gene ymdB. While the four 2019-nCoVs have no SNPs on the two predicted ORFs,
they have two nonsynonymous SNPs on ymdB, which indicates that these 2019-nCoV may derived

from one origin. Besides, compared with the two Bat SARS-like Coronaviruses, 2019-nCoVs have
4, ~130, ~220 nonsynonymous SNPs on the three core genes respectively, which shows the
differences among 2019-nCoV and SARS-CoV-like Coronaviruses.
Except for 2019-nCoVs, our predictions for all coronaviruses indicate that Night-heron coronavirus
HKU19, which is reported to infect a vertebrate, Night-heron, also has the strong potential to infect
human. Coronaviruses are a large family of viruses which usually circulate among animals which
will cause fatal diseases, once they mutate and evolve to be able to infect human. For example,
severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) and Middle East respiratory syndrome
coronavirus (MERS-CoV) are the most impressive ones. In November 2002, SARS-CoV found its
first victim in Foshan, mainland China, and soon spread to all over the country by travelling with
potential patients (9). Different from other human-derived coronaviruses, SARS-CoV leads to
severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS), with a fatality rate of up to ~10%. By July 2003,
SARS-CoV had caused 8069 cases in 27 countries, 774 of them died (16). Another distinctive
coronavirus, known as MERS-CoV, was isolated from a man died of severe pneumonia and organ
failure in Saudi Arabia at June 2012 (10). MERS-CoV has infected 2,494 individuals in 27 countries
since 2012, 858 of them died (17). A much higher fatality rate (~35%) has been shown in Middle
East respiratory syndrome. Large epidemics of SARS and MERS have finished already, but
follow-up studies never stop. High lethality and high human-to-human infectivity shown in these
two diseases have raised alarm all over the world. Therefore, it’s urgent for us to seek out a new way
and establish defensive lines for public health.
To sum up, in this report we predicted the potential of infecting human of 2019-nCoV, with
implication of the risk of the 2019-nCoV. Aiming to give reliable predicted hosts and potential of
infecting human of novel virus, VHP could play an important role in public health service and
provide strong assistance for take precautions of novel viruses which have potential to infect
human.
At the end of this report, we provide a brief description of VHP method and the verification of the
algorithm. To construct the VHP model, we utilized a Bi-path Convolutional Neural Networks
(BiPathCNN) (18), where each viral sequence was represented by one-hot matrix of its base and
codon separately. Considering difference in input sequence lengths, two BiPathCNNs
(BiPathCNN-A and BiPathCNN-B) were built for predicting hosts of viral sequences from 100 bp
to 400 bp and 400 bp to 800 bp respectively. The dataset (7) for training and testing includes
genomes of all DNA viruses, coding sequences of all RNA viruses and their host information in

GenBank. In order to develop a method expert in predicting the potential host types of novel viruses,
the viral sequences data released before 2018 were used to build the training set, while those
released after 2018 were utilized for testing. We integrated the hosts of viruses into five types,
including plant, germ, invertebrate, vertebrate and human. The host subtypes contained in these five
types are listed in Table 2 in detail. In the practical application for viral sequences, with the input of
viral nucleotide sequence, VHP will output five scores for each host type, reflecting the infectivity
within each host type respectively. Furthermore, VHP provides five p-values, statistical measures of
how distinct the infections are compared with non-infection events. In order to evaluate the
performance of VHP, we compare AUC (Area Under Curve) of both blast and VHP. The
comparison result shows that VHP performs with evidently higher AUC in average (shown in Table
3).
