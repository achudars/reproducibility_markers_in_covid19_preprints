Abstract

29

SARS-CoV-2 is a coronavirus that sparked the current COVID-19 pandemic. To stop the

30

shattering effect of COVID-19, effective and safe vaccines, and antiviral therapies are urgently

31

needed. To facilitate the preclinical evaluation of intervention approaches, relevant animal

32

models need to be developed and validated. Rhesus macaques (Macaca mulatta) and

33

cynomolgus macaques (Macaca fascicularis) are widely used in biomedical research and serve

34

as models for SARS-CoV-2 infection. However, differences in study design make it difficult to

35

compare and understand potential species-related differences. Here, we directly compared

36

the course of SARS-CoV-2 infection in the two genetically closely-related macaque species.

37

After inoculation with a low passage SARS-CoV-2 isolate, clinical, virological, and

38

immunological characteristics were monitored.

39

Both species showed slightly elevated body temperatures in the first days after exposure while

40

a decrease in physical activity was only observed in the rhesus macaques and not in

41

cynomolgus macaques. The virus was quantified in tracheal, nasal, and anal swabs, and in

42

blood samples by qRT-PCR, and showed high similarity between the two species.

43

Immunoglobulins were detected by various enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays (ELISAs)

44

and showed seroconversion in all animals by day 10 post-infection. The cytokine responses

45

were highly comparable between species and computed tomography (CT) imaging revealed

46

pulmonary lesions in all animals. Consequently, we concluded that both rhesus and

47

cynomolgus macaques represent valid models for evaluation of COVID-19 vaccine and

48

antiviral candidates in a preclinical setting.

SARS-CoV-2 infection can have a wide range of symptoms. It can cause asymptomatic or mild

53

disease, but can also have a severe, potentially deadly outcome. Vaccines and antivirals will

54

therefore be crucial in fighting the current COVID-19 pandemic. For testing these prophylactic

55

and therapeutic treatments, and investigating the progression of infection and disease

56

development, animal models play an essential role. In this study, we compare the course of

57

SARS-CoV-2 infection in rhesus and cynomolgus macaques. Both species showed moderate

58

disease symptoms as shown by pulmonary lesions by CT imaging. Shedding of infectious virus

59

from the respiratory system was also documented. This study provides a detailed description

60

of the pathogenesis of a low-passage SARS-CoV-2 isolate in two macaque models and suggests

61

that both species represent an equally good model in research for both COVID-19 prophylactic

62

and therapeutic treatments.

Introduction

65

At the end of 2019, the first cases of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) were described in

66

the Wuhan region, China [1]. Since then, the causative agent of COVID-19, the Severe Acute

67

Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) has spread rapidly across the globe,

68

leading the World Health Organization to officially declare COVID-19 a pandemic on 11 March

69

2020. To halt the devastating impact of this disease and the ongoing pandemic, vaccines and

70

antiviral therapies are desperately needed, as well as fundamental knowledge to understand

71

the mode of infection and its associated pathologies. Hence, enormous efforts are initiated to

72

develop a wide range of COVID-19 vaccines.

73

Between humans, transmission mainly occurs via aerosolized droplets after sneezing or

74

coughing or via direct contact with contaminated surfaces. Similar to the related SARS-CoV,

75

SARS-CoV-2 enters the body via docking with its spike (S) protein to the angiotensin-

76

converting enzyme-2 (ACE2) receptor protein [2]. ACE2 is abundantly expressed on cells of the

77

respiratory system but also on a variety of other organ tissues, including those of the brain

78

and the gastrointestinal tract [3]. This wide-spread distribution of the ACE2 receptor may

79

explain the complex clinical picture of COVID-19. The spectrum of COVID-19 ranges from

80

asymptomatic or mild disease, via flu-like illness to a severe, potentially deadly disease [4].

81

The most typical hallmark of severe COVID-19 is pneumonia leading to respiratory failure,

82

which occurs after the onset of dyspnea and hypoxemia [5]. However, COVID-19 patients may

83

also suffer from a variety of other symptoms, including amongst other gastrointestinal

84

symptoms, neurological disorders, coagulopathy, and cardiac injury [5-8].

85

Animal models to investigate the progression of infection and disease development, and to

86

evaluate prophylactic and therapeutic treatment options, are essential to warrant progress in

87

SARS-CoV-2 fundamental and applied research. Different animal species have shown their

88

value in SARS-CoV-2 research. Originally developed to study SARS-CoV [9], transgenic mice

89

that express the ACE2 receptor elucidated various aspects of COVID-19 [10, 11]. Rodent

90

species, such as the Syrian hamster, turned out to be susceptible to infection with SARS-CoV-

91

2, and hamsters were subsequently utilized to test a live-attenuated YF17D-vectored SARS-

92

CoV2 vaccine candidate [12, 13]. Ferrets represent an established animal model to study the

93

pathology and transmission of respiratory viruses, like influenza viruses [14]. During the

94

course of SARS-CoV infection, viral replication was documented in the upper and lower

95

respiratory tract [15]. Transmission of SARS-CoV-2 among ferrets via either air or direct

96

contact has been shown recently, where virus was shed in nasal washes, saliva, feces, and

97

urine of infected animals [16, 17]. Notwithstanding the great importance of rodent and ferret

98

models, also non-human primates (NHPs) will likely play a pivotal role in COVID-19 research.

99

Like with SARS-CoV, NHPs are susceptible to infection with human SARS-CoV-2. Due to their

100

close phylogenetic relationship, NHPs and humans share many immunological and

101

pathological characteristics [18-20]. This makes NHPs suitable for preclinical evaluation of

102

vaccines and antiviral or immunomodulatory compounds to combat SARS-CoV-2. So far, five

103

species of NHPs; rhesus and cynomolgus macaques, common marmosets (Callithrix jacchus),

104

African green monkeys (Chlorocebus sabaeus), and sacred baboons (Papio hamadryas) have

105

featured in SARS-CoV-2 studies. Common marmosets, a small New World monkey species, are

106

susceptible to infection with SARS and MERS coronaviruses [21, 22], but appear to be

107

relatively resistant to infection with SARS-CoV-2 as only low levels of virus replication could

108

be measured [23, 24]. African green monkeys presented robust virus replication and also

109

showed evidence of respiratory disease [25, 26], in contrast to baboons where variable levels

110

of virus replication were measured [24]. The two most widely-used NHP species in biomedical

111

research are rhesus macaques and cynomolgus macaques. Both macaque species had already

6

112

proven their value in research on the related coronaviruses that caused the SARS and MERS

113

epidemics [27, 28], and thus are considered relevant NHP models for preclinical COVID-19

114

studies. Cynomolgus macaques have been deployed in studies describing aspects of SARS-

115

CoV-2 pathogenesis [23, 29, 30], and have been utilized to evaluate the efficacy of

116

hydroxychloroquine as an antiviral compound [31]. Rhesus macaques have also been applied

117

in COVID-19 pathogenesis studies [22, 24, 32, 33], and to test the efficacy of remdesivir in the

118

treatment of SARS-CoV-2 infection [34]. Additionally, several prototype COVID-19 vaccine

119

candidates have received their first efficacy evaluation in the rhesus macaque model [35-42].

120

Some research groups [23, 24] shed light on the heterogeneity in SARS-CoV-2 infection and

121

investigated disease progression in different NHP species. Most of these studies were

122

conducted by different research teams, and a controlled comparative approach is lacking thus

123

far.

124

In other NHP disease models, like those developed for AIDS, TB, and influenza research, the

125

choice of macaque (sub)species can influence the disease outcome considerably [43-47]. The

126

choice of a specific NHP species for research on a new and complex disease, like COVID-19, is

127

therefore not a trivial one and the key question which macaque species is best suited to

128

investigate specific aspects of COVID-19 research needs to be answered. To address this issue,

129

we compared SARS-CoV-2 replication in rhesus and cynomolgus macaque species and

130

monitored signs of COVID-19-like disease symptoms for three weeks after infection. The

131

macaques were infected in parallel with the same virus stock, received completely identical

132

treatment, and the course of infection was followed using the same analyses, including

133

monitoring of lung pathology using computed tomography (CT), and continuous telemetric

134

recording of body temperature and activity of the animals.

Results

137

Infection of macaques with SARS-CoV-2

138

After administration of the virus in the upper trachea and nose, levels of viral RNA were

139

detectable in the tracheal and nasal swabs of all monkeys at day 1 pi. Viral RNA remained

140

evident in swab samples for several days. In the tracheal swab sample of rhesus macaque

141

R14002, viral RNA was first time below the detection time at 10 days pi. (Fig 1A, S1 Table). The

142

individual variation of SARS-CoV-2 RNA levels detected in the macaques, regardless of species,

143

was considerable. Peak viral RNA levels in the trachea varied between 1.7 x 104 copies/ml

144

(R15096; day 1 pi) and 1.8 x 108 copies/ml (J16017; day 2 pi). The time frame in which viral

145

genetic material could be detected varied from only one day (R15096; day 1 pi) up to day 10

146

pi. (animal R14002, RNA in the trachea).

147

Peak viral loads detected in nasal swabs were generally lower than levels observed in the

148

throat samples and did not exceed 9.5 x 104copies/ml (R15090; day 1 pi). The high virus loads

149

measured in the first two days post-infection may suggest that some remaining RNA from the

150

original inoculum was still present. However, in all macaques, viral RNA was also isolated from

151

nasal swabs at later time points, showing that SARS-CoV-2 was excreted via the nose, and thus

152

indicative for viral replication. The total viral RNA production over time is shown in Fig 1B.

153

The patterns of viral RNA detection in swabs also varied between individuals. The most

154

outstanding observation was made for cynomolgus macaque J16017 that was positive in the

155

nose at day 1 pi, then had no detectable viral RNA for a period of three days, but later the

156

animal became again positive in the nose swabs for three consecutive days. Other animals

157

(R15096, J16004, J16012, and Ji40805) also became PCR-positive again after a period of one

158

or more days characterized by undetectable levels. In the anal swabs, viral genetic material

159

was rarely detected. Only at a few time points, three macaques tested positive, with a
8

160

maximum viral RNA load of 3 x 103 copies/ml at day 1 pi., namely in cynomolgus macaque

161

J16017. One animal tested positive for viral RNA in blood at a single time point; R15080 at day

162

5 pi. (S1 Table). Notably, no significant differences in viral RNA loads were calculated between

163

the macaque species (Fig 1B).

164
165

Body temperature, activity, clinical symptoms and blood parameters after SARS-CoV-2

166

infection

167

Body temperature and activity of each animal was continuously monitored using a Physiotel

168

Digital telemetric device during the entire study. Upon infection, elevated body temperatures

169

were measured in both macaque species, which could be correlated to the episodes of viral

170

replication in the nose and trachea as was evidenced by qRT-PCR. In Fig 2, we show the body

171

temperature alterations from the baseline during the study. In both groups of animals, the

172

body temperature was significantly higher during the first two weeks after infection as

173

compared to later time points (Fig 2). The temperature curves for the individual animals are

174

depicted in the supplementary data (S1 Fig). The group of cynomolgus macaques showed

175

elevated body temperature in the first 8 to 10 days following infection. This is in contrast with

176

the measurements of the rhesus macaques where no substantial rise in temperature was

177

measured, except for two animals (R14002 and R15090) that showed a sudden peak in body

178

temperature of 0.7°C at day 8 pi.

179

The activity curves measured in the 3-weeks observation period for all individuals are

180

documented in the S2A Fig. The cumulative activity scores in the first 2 weeks pi. were

181

compared with activity scores in the last week of the study period (S2B Fig). The paired t-test

182

illustrated a significantly lower activity in all four rhesus macaques during the first period after

9

183

infection (p=0.0072), while this difference in cynomolgus macaques was less obvious and only

184

found in 2 out of 4 macaques.

185

We applied a clinical scoring list to enumerate clinical symptoms that may be caused by the

186

SARS-CoV-2 infection (S2 Table). The cumulative clinical scores per week did not exceed 50 (of

187

a maximum 490 score per week; data not shown), confirming the absence of serious COVID-

188

19-related symptoms. However, in the second week of infection, cynomolgus macaques

189

showed more, but still mild, clinical symptoms than rhesus macaques. This was less evident

190

during the first and third weeks, probably due to outlier clinical scores of individual animals

191

(Fig 3).

192

Blood samples were analyzed for changes in cell subsets and in biochemical parameters. These

193

data were related to a set of normal (standard) values derived from uninfected, healthy

194

rhesus, and cynomolgus macaques from the same breeding colony. No significant deviations

195

from the normal values were seen in blood cell subsets of the infected monkeys. C-reactive

196

protein levels, which are increased in COVID-19 patients with pneumonia [48], were not found

197

higher in infected macaques. In humans, acute kidney injury has been related to SARS-CoV-2

198

infection [49, 50], and elevated levels of serum creatinine and blood urea were detected in

199

10-15% of a cohort of COVID-19 patients [51]. Hence, we measured creatinine and urea levels

200

in macaque blood samples at days 0, 5, 10, 14, and 22 pi., but did not find evidence of kidney

201

malfunction in the infected, but otherwise seemingly healthy monkeys. Equally, depending on

202

the severity of the disease, blood coagulation disorders, like highly elevated D-dimer levels,

203

have been reported for patients [52, 53], but no elevated D-dimer levels were measured in

204

either macaque species. Elevated levels of glucose and alanine transferase were measured in

205

the first week pi. in the blood of most animals, and amylase was increased in one rhesus

206

macaque, R15080 (S3 Fig).

Detection of lung lesions in macaques after SARS-CoV-2 infection.

209

Chest CTs of the macaques after infection revealed several manifestations of COVID-19 with

210

a variable time course and lung involvement (Table 1). The most common lesion types that

211

were found in both rhesus and cynomolgus macaques were ground glass opacities (GGO),

212

consolidations, and crazy paving patterns (CCP) (Fig 4).

Lung lesions (max. CT score 2/35) were already seen in CTs early after infection on day 2 in 5

216

out of 8 monkeys, three rhesus, and two cynomolgus macaques. Thereafter, lung involvement

217

was seen in most animals and CT scores increased. Around days 8 and 10 pi., lung lesions were

218

manifest in all animals, and in several macaques the coverage had increased (Table 1). Again,

219

individual variations in lung pathology were considerable; for instance, rhesus macaque

220

R15090 showed low CT scores of 2 only at days 2 and 8 pi, while rhesus macaque R15096 had

221

positive CT scores at all time points after experimental infection, varying from 1 to 4.

222

Cynomolgus macaque J16012 suffered from serious lung damage as early as day 4 pi (score 5)

223

and had a positive chest CT at 8 out of 9 time points. In Fig 5, the cumulative CT scores over

224

the monitoring period are depicted. The increase in cumulative CT score was 0.692 points per

225

day (95% CI 0.657 to 0.726) and no difference was observed between rhesus and cynomolgus

226

macaques (P = 0.2708).

227
228

Immune response to SARS-CoV-2 infection

229

Humoral immune responses developed relatively fast after infection (Fig 6 and S4 Fig). Total

230

immunoglobulin (Ig) in serum was detected by the DR-ELISA. The antibody response directed

231

to the nucleoprotein (N) of SARS-CoV-2 became evident between day 10 and 12 pi., and

232

continued to rise thereafter, but with individual variations in total Ig levels and patterns. While

233

Ig levels in several animals, both rhesus and cynomolgus macaques, continued to rise until day

234

21 pi., the Ig levels in others already showed first signs of a decline at day 17 pi. The total Ig

235

pattern seen in the sera of all macaques was reflected by the measurement of IgG directed to

236

the N protein in the same sera. Notably, the development of IgM titers was barely detected

237

in the longitudinal serum samples. In sera from only one animal, cynomolgus macaque

238

J106012, IgM was detectable, beginning at day 12 pi. but titers already started to decline to

239

baseline levels at the end of the study at day 22 pi.

240
241

Cytokine and chemokine measurements

242

Serum levels of 13 cytokines and chemokines were measured to examine the nature of the

243

inflammatory response triggered by the infection with SARS-CoV-2. We investigated if any

244

species differences could be distinguished in the inflammatory response to infection. All

245

metadata obtained from the individual animals are depicted in S5 Fig. Directly upon infection,

246

IP-10 and MCP-1 levels peaked in sera of all cynomolgus macaques. The IP-10 peak at day 2

247

pi. quickly returned to baseline values. In contrast, in rhesus macaques, only a minor rise in

12

bioRxiv preprint doi: https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.11.05.369413; this version posted November 5, 2020. The copyright holder for this

248

IP-10 levels was observed at the same time interval. In the same time span, but in both

249

macaque species, the levels of chemokine MCP-1 (CCL2) increased. Levels of other

250

chemokines, like eotaxin (CCL11), MIP-1𝛼 (CCL3), MIP-1β (CCL4), but also the cytokines IL-6

251

and IFN-𝛾 dropped in the first week after infection and started rising around two weeks pi.

252

This decline of particular serum cytokine and chemokine levels coincided with the time period

253

that viral RNA was detectable in nasal and tracheal swabs, indicative for virus production. A

254

different pattern was seen for RANTES (CCL5) and TNF𝛼 proteins; serum levels were high in

255

the first 2 weeks after infection and then started decreasing to undetectable levels. RANTES

256

serum concentrations also showed an initial drop very early after infection. This was most

257

prominent in the cynomolgus macaques where RANTES levels dropped to zero on day 1 pi.

and started to increase at day 6 pi. Post-infection levels of I-TAC (CXCL11), MIG (CXCL9), and

259

IL-8 (CXCL8) were below detection or were not influenced by the SARS-CoV-2 infection.

Discussion

262

In humans, COVID-19 was initially regarded as a respiratory disease, but now it is clear that

263

individuals that succumb to this disease can display a complex array of pathologies that cover

264

a broad spectrum of symptoms. To sort out the factors leading to the different COVID-19

265

manifestations, animal models are essential. Due to their similarity to humans, specifically,

266

non-human primates can play a pivotal role in this type of preclinical research. To best

267

appreciate the potential of the various macaque species as SARS-CoV-2 infection models, a

268

thorough characterization of the course of infection is needed. The comparative study

269

reported in this communication contributes to the knowledge, but more importantly validates

270

the macaque models that are currently in use in SARS-CoV-2 research.

271

Unlike in some human patients, we found no evidence for renal involvement or coagulation

272

disorders in our monkeys. Equally, increasing C-reactive protein (CRP) levels are a marker in

273

the early diagnosis of pneumonia [48], but different from humans; these levels were not

274

subject to change in the infected macaques during the 3-weeks monitoring period. A direct

275

comparison with humans is hampered by the fact that the macaques were infected, but

276

seemingly healthy, while most published findings in humans were obtained from COVID-19

277

patients in various stages of disease. Unbiased measurement of the body temperature and

278

activity of each animal was done using a telemetric device implanted in the abdomen.

279

Monitoring by telemetry is an important asset as in both macaque species a notable difference

280

in body temperature was recorded in the first 2 weeks (period of active virus replication) as

281

compared to the third week. Significant differences in animal activity indicated that SARS-CoV-

282

2 infection also influenced the well-being of the animals without causing obvious clinical

283

symptoms. Notably, the elevation in body temperature on the first day of infection, as was

284

reported by Munster et al., was not seen in our study, possibly pointing to a potential

285

difference in the sampling method. While we used 24/7 monitoring, in the study described by

286

Munster et al., temperature was measured only on selected days on anesthetized animals

287

[54]. However, variation can also be due to a difference between the challenge viruses used,

288

the methods used for virus inoculation, or the origin and adaptation of the animals used.

289

Antibody responses were detectable in all animals after infection. Interestingly, no IgM was

290

detected in 7 out of 8 animals. This result was confirmed by a second, in-house developed

291

IgM-ELISA, but instead, the SARS-CoV-2 S protein was used as coating antigen. This approach

292

excludes a technical flaw in the serological assay used. We cannot explain the lack of IgM

293

response to infection, but similar observations were made in an infection study using African

294

Green monkeys. Hartman et al. did detect IgM, but the titers were very low, not exceeding

14

295

1Log10 above the assay limit of detection [26]. In contrast, the development of IgG accurately

296

followed the course of virus infection, as it became first detectable within one week after the

297

virus had become undetectable in sera by RT-PCR. This was in line with findings of others [25,

298

26, 29].

299

In a subset of COVID-19 patients, the acute respiratory syndrome coincides with a ‘cytokine

300

storm’ or hypercytokinemia, which eventually can result in multi-organ failure [55]. Patients

301

with severe COVID-19 symptoms on intensive care units had significantly elevated plasma

302

levels of proinflammatory cytokines, like IL-2, IL-7, IL-10, GSCF, IP-10, MCP-1, MIP-1α, and TNF-

303

α [56]. In this study, macaques did not show overt disease symptoms of COVID-19, but certain

304

cytokines, like IL-6, IFN-𝛾, MIP-1α, and MIP-1β increased in the plasma of both macaque

305

species, indicating the involvement of the chemokine system during SARS-CoV-2 infection.

306

The cytokine profiles after SARS-CoV-2 were highly comparable between species, except for

307

IP-10 and MCP-1, suggesting differential involvement of monocyte activation between the

308

two species. The similarity in cytokine response after SARS-CoV-2 infection contrasts with

309

observations made after infection of macaques with another respiratory virus, pandemic

310

H1N1 influenza [47]. In that study, macaque species-specific cytokine responses (IL-6, MCP-1,

311

IL-15, IL-1Ra, MIP-1α, and IL-8) were induced upon infection with pH1N1, highlighting the virus

312

type-specific reaction of the chemokine system.

313

Unlike most published studies, we decided not to conduct a necropsy on animals early, 4-5

314

days, post-infection. At that time point after infection, evidence was found for acute viral

315

interstitial pneumonia [30, 32, 34, 54]. Instead, we performed CT imaging to visualize lung

316

pathology induced by SARS-CoV-2. In humans, the sensitivity of CT scanning for lung pathology

317

is high (positive predictive value of 92%), but the type of lesions found are not COVID-19-

318

specific, and can also be observed in a number of other infectious and non-infectious diseases

15

319

[57, 58]. In this study, we used purpose-bred NHPs with a well-documented health status and

320

we could compare the scans with a CT obtained just before infection. Therefore, CT imaging

321

provides a valuable tool to specifically monitor the progression of COVID-19-related lung

322

pathology during the entire course of the study. Based on the criteria set to determine clinical

323

severity [59], the macaques in our panel featured moderate disease levels as all eight

324

individuals show levels of pneumonia. In another study using only cynomolgus macaques and

325

using CT imaging as well, lesions were found as early as 2 days post-infection in infected

326

animals [29]. Type-wise, the lung lesions described in that report were comparable to the ones

327

in this communication, but they tend to be located deeper in the lungs. An explanation for

328

this difference may be that the method of instillation of the virus is the underlying cause. Finch

329

et al. administered the virus into each bronchus by direct bilateral primary post-carinal

330

intrabronchial instillation, whereas we applied the virus relatively high in the trachea, just

331

below the vocal cords. For similar reasons as reported by the same research team [29], we did

332

not collect bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) samples from our animals to avoid unwanted

333

interventions in the natural infection process caused by SARS-CoV-2. Studies performed at our

334

institute with respiratory viruses have shown that lung lavages can indeed significantly

335

influence the infection process (manuscript in preparation). Instead of BAL samples, we

336

collected tracheal swabs for virological analysis. The viral RNA loads, but also the temporal

337

pattern of detection in swabs samples were like those observed in BAL samples from other

338

studies [22, 24, 34, 38]. This demonstrates that tracheal swabs are a good alternative for BAL

339

sampling. In addition, the collection of tracheal swabs is a less invasive technique that causes

340

relatively minor discomfort to the animals.

341

In most SARS-CoV-2 studies in non-human primates, the animals are euthanized shortly after

342

infection in the first week, or after a period of 3 weeks. The animals from this study were not

16

343

euthanized to be able to perform re-infection studies or to monitor them for late clinical signs,

344

or co-morbidities related to COVID-19.

345

We conclude that the course of SARS-CoV-2 infection of both macaque species is highly

346

similar, indicating that they are equally suitable models to test vaccines and antivirals in a

347

preclinical setting for safety and efficacy. The macaque model for SARS-CoV-2 infection in

348

humans manifests important virological aspects of this disease in humans. Given their

349

immunological and physiological resemblance to humans, NHPs likely will continue to play a

350

pivotal role in research for both COVID-19 prophylactic and therapeutic treatments.

368

Animals

369

Four Indian-origin rhesus macaques and four cynomolgus macaques were used in this study

370

(S3 Table). All macaques were mature, outbred animals, purpose-bred, and housed at the

371

BPRC. The animals were in good physical health with normal baseline biochemical and

372

hematological values. All were pair-housed with a socially compatible cage-mate in cages of

373

at least 4 m3 with bedding to allow foraging and were kept on a 12-hour light/dark cycle. The

374

monkeys were offered a daily diet consisting of monkey food pellets (Ssniff, Soest, Germany)

375

supplemented with vegetables and fruit. Enrichment was provided daily in the form of pieces

376

of wood, mirrors, food puzzles, and a variety of other homemade or commercially available

377

enrichment products. Drinking water was available ad libitum via an automatic watering

378

system. Animal Care staff provided daily visual health checks before infection, and twice-daily

379

after infection. The animals were monitored for appetite, general behavior, and stool

380

consistency. All possible precautions were taken to ensure the welfare and to avoid any

381

discomfort to the animals. All experimental interventions (intratracheal and intranasal

382

infection, swabs, blood samplings, and CT scans) were performed under anesthesia.

383
384

Virus stock

385

The animals were infected with the SARS-CoV-2 strain BetaCoV/BavPat1/2020. This strain was

386

isolated from a patient who traveled from China to Germany, and an aliquot of a Vero E6 cell

387

culture was made available through the European Virus Archive-Global (EVAg). The viral stock

388

for the infection study was propagated on Vero E6 cells. For this study, a fifth passage virus

389

stock was prepared with a titer of 3.2x106 TCID50 per ml. The integrity of the virus stock was

390

confirmed by sequence analysis.

391
392

Experimental infections and post-exposure study follow-up

393

Three weeks before the experimental infection, a Physiotel Digital device (DSI Implantable

394

Telemetry, Data Sciences International, Harvard Bioscience, UK) was implanted in the

395

abdominal cavity of each animal. This device allowed the continuous real-time measurement

396

of the body temperature and the animals’ activity remotely using telemetry throughout the

397

study.

398

At day 0, all animals were exposed to a dose of 1 x 106 TCID50 of SARS-CoV-2, diluted in 5 ml

399

phosphate buffered saline (PBS). The virus was inoculated via a combination of the

400

intratracheal route (4.5 ml) and intranasal route (0.25 ml per nostril). Virus infection was

401

monitored for 22 days, during which period the animals were checked twice-daily by the

402

animal caretakers and scored for clinical symptoms according to a previously published,

403

adapted scoring system [60] (S2 Table). A numeric score of 35 or more per observation time

404

point was predetermined to serve as an endpoint and justification for euthanasia. Every time

405

an animal was sedated, the body weight was measured. Blood was collected using standard

406

aseptic methods from the femoral vein at regular time points post-infection (pi). In parallel,

407

tracheal, nasal, and anal swabs were collected using Copan FLOQSwabs (MLS, Menen,

408

Belgium). Swabs were placed in 1 ml DMEM, supplemented with 0.5% bovine serum albumin

409

(BSA), fungizone (2.5 μg/ml), penicillin (100 U/ml), and streptomycin (100 μg/ml) and directly

410

transported to the BSL3 lab.

411
412

Biochemistry and hematology analysis

413

Clinical biochemistry was performed using a Vetscan VS2 Chemical analyzer (Zoetis Benelux,

414

Capelle aan de IJssel, The Netherlands) with the use of the Comprehensive Diagnostic profile.

19

415

This profile allows testing for alanine aminotransferase, albumin, alkaline phosphatase,

416

amylase, calcium, creatinine, globulin, glucose, phosphorus, potassium, sodium, total

417

bilirubin, total protein, and blood urea nitrogen. Hematology was performed using a Vetscan

418

HM5 Hematology analyser (Zoetis Benelux, Capelle aan de IJssel, The Netherlands). C-reactive

419

protein and D-dimer levels were measured using Cobas Integra 400 plus analyzer (Roche

420

Diagnostics Nederland B.V.).

421
422

Viral RNA detection

423

Viral RNA was isolated from plasma and swab sample supernatants using a QIAamp Viral RNA

424

Mini kit (Qiagen Benelux BV, Venlo, The Netherlands) following the manufacturer’s

425

instructions. Viral RNA was reverse-transcribed to cDNA using a Transcriptor First Strand cDNA

426

Synthesis kit (Roche Diagnostics BV, Almere, The Netherlands). Viral RNA was quantified by

427

real-time quantitative RT-PCR specific for the RdRp gene of SARS-CoV-2, as described by

428

Corman et al. [61]. The lower detection limit of the qRT-PCR was 3.6 viral RNA copies per

429

reaction.

430
431

Computed tomography

432

Computed tomography (CT) data were acquired on several time points until day 22 (D0, 2, 4,

433

6, 8, 10, 12, 14, 16, 22 post-infection) using a MultiScan Large Field of View Extreme Resolution

434

Research Imager (LFER) 150 PET-CT (Mediso Medical Imaging Systems Ltd., Budapest,

435

Hungary). Animals were sedated with ketamine (10 mg/kg ketamine hydrochloride (Alfasan

436

Nederland BV, Woerden, The Netherlands) combined with medetomidine hydrochloride, 0.05

437

mg/kg (Sedastart; AST Farma B.V., Oudewater, The Netherlands) to induce sedation and

438

muscle relaxation, both applied intramuscularly (IM). The monkeys were positioned head first

439

supine (HFS) with the arms up and fixated in a vacuum pillow. A single CT of the thorax takes

440

35 seconds by which respiratory motion is inevitable, therefore, to mitigate the impact of

441

respiratory motion and improve the image quality, respiratory gating was applied. The

442

respiratory amplitude was detected with a gating pad placed next to the belly button. At the

443

end of the procedure, when the macaques returned to their home cage, atipamezole

444

(Sedastop; AST Farma B.V., Oudewater, The Netherlands) was given IM (0.25 mg/kg).

445

For the final reconstruction, the expiration phases were exclusively used and manually

446

selected. A semi-quantitative scoring system for chest CT evaluation was used to estimate

447

SARS-CoV-2-induced lung disease [29, 62]. Quantification of the CTs was performed

448

independently by two persons based on the sum of the lobar scores. The degree of

449

involvement in each zone was scored as: 0 for no involvement, 1 for <5%, 2 for 5-24%, 3 for

450

25-49%, 4 for 50-74% and 5 for >=75% involvement. An additional increase or decrease of 0.5

451

was used to indicate alterations in CT density of the lesions. By using this scoring system, a

452

maximum score of 35 could be reached for the combined lobes per time point.

453
454

Assessment of cytokine and chemokine protein levels in serum

455

Cytokine and chemokine concentrations in sera of infected macaques, including IL-1β, IL-6,

456

CCL11 (Eotaxin), CXCL10 (IP-10), CXCL11 (I-TAC), CCL2 (MCP-1), CXCL9 (MIG), CCL3 (MIP-1𝛼),

457

CCL4 (MIP-1β), CCL5 (RANTES), CXCL8 (IL-8), TNF𝛼, and IFN𝛾, were determined using

458

LEGENDplex™ NHP Chemokine/Cytokine Panel (13-plex) (Biolegend, San Diego, CA, USA)

459

according to manufacturer’s instruction. Samples were measured on an LSRII FACS machine

460

and analyzed by using company software.

463

The total antibody response in macaque sera was analyzed in a double recognition enzyme-

464

linked immunosorbent assay (DR-ELISA) that detects total immunoglobulins in serum and

465

targeted to the SARS-CoV-2 nucleoprotein (N) protein as described by Hoste et al. [63]

466

(INgezim COVID19 DR; Eurofins-INGENASA, Madrid, Spain). Additionally, two in-house indirect

467

ELISAs were used to detect monkey immunoglobulin G (IgG) and immunoglobulin M (IgM)

468

directed to SARS-CoV-2 N protein. Briefly, Corning® 96-Well High-Binding Flat-Bottom

469

Microplates were coated with N protein and incubated overnight at 4°C in carbonate buffer,

470

pH 9.6. After washing the wells with PBS pH 7.4/0.05% Tween 20 (PBST), a blocking step was

471

performed with StabilZyme® SELECT Stabilizer (SurModics, Inc., Eden Prairie, MN, USA) for 1h

472

at room temperature (RT). The plate was then incubated with serum samples diluted 1:100 in

473

PBST with 2.5% fetal bovine serum (Gibco; Thermo Fisher Scientific, Inc., Waltham, MA, USA)

474

for 1h at RT. Two positive, cut-off, and negative controls were added to each plate. For

475

macaque-IgG detection, the wells were washed as described above and incubated with

476

Peroxidase-conjugated AffiniPure Goat Anti-Human IgG, Fcγ Fragment Specific (Jackson

477

ImmunoResearch Laboratories, Inc., PA, USA) diluted 1:25 000 in StabilZyme® HRP Conjugate

478

Stabilizer (SurModics), supplemented with 0.5M NaCl for 1h at RT. Finally, after a washing

479

step, the plate was incubated for 15 min with the substrate (TMB-MAX, Neogen Corporation,

480

Lexington, KY, USA) and the reaction was stopped by addition of 0.5 M sulfuric acid. The

481

absorbance was measured at 450 nm using a SpectraMax M5 plate reader (Molecular Devices,

482

LLC., San Jose, CA, USA). To detect macaque-IgM, the same protocol was followed, but the

483

secondary antibody used was an anti-Monkey IgM (μ-chain specific)-Peroxidase antibody

484

produced in goat (Sigma-Aldrich, Merck KGaA, MI, USA) at 1:5000 dilution.
