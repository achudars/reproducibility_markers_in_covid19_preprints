Abstract
Motivation: Danchin et al. have pointed out that cytosine drives the evolution of SARS-CoV-2. A depletion of cytosine might lead to the attenuation of SARS-CoV-2.
Results: We built a website to track the composition change of mono-, di-, and tri-nucleotide of SARSCoV-2 over time. The website downloads new strains available from GISAID and updates its results
daily. Our analysis suggests that the composition of cytosine in coronaviruses is related to their reported
mortality. Using 137,315 SARS-CoV-2 strains collected in ten months, we observed cytosine depletion
at a rate of about one cytosine loss per month from the whole genome.

Introduction

SARS-CoV-2 is a positive-strand RNA virus. The intracellular
multiplication of positive-strand RNA viruses requires complex
interactions with the host cell. The coronavirus genome mimics
the structure of a cellular mRNA. It is rapidly translated into an
RNA-dependent replicase and proteins that allow the virus to hijack specific host functions used during viral translation, RNA
replication, and viral envelope construction. The virus uses a
critical set of metabolic pathways to access the pool of ribonucleotide triphosphates needed for the transcription of many copies of the replicated RNA strand. This makes the viral sequence
highly sensitive to changes in the nucleotide pool, the composition of which might be reflected in the virus evolution as it mutates. Although coronaviruses have evolved a specific function
meant to overcome some of this limitation via a proofreading
step in the replicase function, yet mutations remain unavoidable
and viruses, which generate a vast number of particles within a
single patient, will evolve quasi-species that will progressively
integrate the various types of selection pressure that the virus
faces.
Among the pressures, the availability of CTP (Cytidine triphosphate, and hence of cytosine-based precursors) might be an
important driving force in the evolution of the virus. The CTP

supply in a human is lower than the three other essential triphosphates ATP, GTP, and TTP for RNA synthesis, and the scarceness of CTP in the host will, in turn, lowers the composition of
cytosine in a virus genome along with its evolution (Armengaud,
et al., 2020; Danchin and Marliere, 2020). This phenomenon is
called depletion, and it co-occurs with the decreased virulence of
an RNA virus commonly observed in an outbreak. If under constant selection pressures, the speed of depletion tends to stabilize, but if extraneous pressures such as massive vaccination or
effective medication, the depletion may slow down or even reverse (Danchin and Timmis, 2020). By evaluating the speed of
cytosine depletion in the new SARS-CoV-2 strains, it might 1)
be used as a new metric at the molecular level for gauging the
speed of the spread of SARS-CoV-2, and 2) predict the resistance of SARS-CoV-2 to new vaccines and drugs.

Methods

We built an interactive website at
http://www.bio8.cs.hku.hk/sarscov2 to show the mono-, di-, and
tri-nucleotide composition trends of the whole genome and single genes. The SARS-CoV-2 genomes used in this website are
from GISAID (https://www.gisaid.org/). The acknowledge table
of the strands used in Table 1 is at
http://www.bio8.cs.hku.hk/sarscov2/gisaid_cov2020_76.xls.

Figure 1: The trend of mononucleotide A, C, G and T in 137,315 SARS-CoV-2 strains collected from Dec 20, 2019 to
Oct 2, 2020. The data points were smoothed by a 15-day window.
New SARS-CoV-2 strains are retrieved from the GISAID platform on a daily basis. We used only full genomes and removed
those sequences short than 29kbp after removing gaps (runs of
‘N’s). IUPAC bases are substituted with C or the alphabetically
smaller base. We used “BetaCoV/Wuhan/WIV04/2019”
(https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/nuccore/MN996528) and its annotations as our reference. For every full genome, use aligned it
against the reference using MAFFT (Katoh and Standley, 2013).
The completeness at both ends of the full genomes varied. Thus,
we removed the bases aligned with the head 130bp and tail 15bp
of the reference.

Results

In Table 1, we first compared the composition of nucleotides in
multiple coronaviruses, including SARS-CoV-2 (an average of
76 strands collected from Dec 20, 2019 to Feb 15, 2020), SARS,
MERS, and four that causes a common cold. Compared to
SARS-CoV-2, which we assumed a relative mortality level of 3,
the percentage of cytosine is lower in almost all of the eleven
genes in the four common cold coronaviruses with a lower

mortality level 1. However, the percentage of cytosine is higher
in SARS (mortality level 4) and MERS (mortality level 5). The
result suggests that cytosine depletion is associated with reduced
morbidity of coronaviruses.
Next, we summarized the trend of different nucleotides in
SARS-CoV-2 strains collected from Dec 20, 2019 to Oct 2,
2020. The results are available on an interactive website at
http://www.bio8.cs.hku.hk/sarscov2. 137,315 strains from
GISAID (Elbe and Buckland-Merrett, 2017) were used (see
Methods). The trend of mono-nucleotides A, C, G, and T of the
whole genome and ten genes are shown in Figure 1 (whole genome, orf1ab, S, E, M, and N), and Supplementary Figure 1
(whole genome, NS3, NS6, NS7a, NS7b, and NS8). The whole
genome shows a sign of cytosine depletion, at a rate of about one
cytosine loss per month. Except for gene E, N, NS7a, and NS7b,
all other genes show a sign of cytosine depletion. The trend of
di-nucleotides and tri-nucleotides is available on the website.
Looking into the trend of di-nucleotides in the whole genome, all
di-nucleotides containing a cytosine are having a sign of depletion except for “GC”.

Table 1: The relative composition of cytosine in the eleven genes (using
the annotation of Wuhan-Hu-1) of four common cold coronaviruses,
SARS and MERS comparing to the average of 76 SARS-CoV-2 strains
(2019-nCoV-avg76, collected from Dec 20, 2019 to Feb 15, 2020). The
mortality levels are set according to their reported mortality.
