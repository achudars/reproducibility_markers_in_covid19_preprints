Abstract
Due to our interest in the chemical space of organic dyes to identify potential small-molecule
inhibitors (SMIs) for protein-protein interactions (PPIs), we initiated a screen of such compounds to assess
their inhibitory activity against the interaction between SARS-CoV-2 spike protein and its cognate receptor
ACE2, which is the first critical step initiating the viral attachment and entry of this coronavirus responsible
for the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic. As part of this, we found that methylene blue, a tricyclic phenothiazine
compound approved by the FDA for the treatment of methemoglobinemia and used for other medical
applications (including the inactivation of viruses in blood products prior to transfusion when activated by
light), inhibits this interaction. We confirmed that it does so in a concentration-dependent manner with a
low micromolar half-maximal inhibitory concentration (IC50 = 3 μM) in our protein-based ELISA-type setup,
while chloroquine, siramesine, and suramin showed no inhibitory activity in this assay. Erythrosine B,
which we have shown before to be a promiscuous SMI of PPIs, also inhibited this interaction with an
activity similar, possibly slightly higher, than those found for it for other PPIs. This PPI inhibitory activity
of methylene blue could contribute to its antiviral activity against SARS-CoV-2 even in the absence of light
by blocking its attachment to ACE2-expressing cells and making this inexpensive and widely available drug
potentially useful in the prevention and treatment of COVID-19 as an oral or inhaled medication.

INTRODUCTION
Severe acute respiratory syndrome-coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), a novel betacoronavirus and the
most recent one of the seven coronaviruses (CoVs) known to infect humans, is responsible for COVID-19,
which has been declared a pandemic by the World Health Organization in March 2020 and continues to
spread worldwide (Liu et al., 2020; Matheson and Lehner, 2020; Moore and June, 2020). While four CoVs
(HCoV 229E, OC43, NL63, and HKU1) are responsible for about one third of the common cold cases in
humans, three have caused recent epidemics associated with considerable mortality: SARS-CoV-1 (2002–
2003, causing ~10% mortality), MERS-CoV (Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus; 2012, causing
~35% mortality), and now SARS-CoV-2 (2019-2020), which seems to be less lethal but more transmissible
(Guy et al., 2020). COVID-19 is the most infectious agent in a century (Tiwari et al., 2020) and has already
caused infections in the order of tens of millions and deaths that are likely to be in the order of millions
worldwide. According to current early estimates, about 3% of infected individuals need hospitalization
and 0.5% die, a range that is strongly age-dependent increasing from 0.001% in <20 years old to 8.3% in
those >80 years old (Salje et al., 2020). Accordingly, there is considerable interest in possible preventive
or therapeutic treatments. There are several possible targets in the coronavirus life cycle for therapeutic
interventions including attachment and entry, uncoating, gRNA replication, translation in endoplasmic
reticulum (ER) and Golgi, assembly, and virion release (Guy et al., 2020). Viral attachment and entry are
particularly promising as they are the first steps in the replication cycle and take place at a relatively
accessible extracellular site; hence, they have been explored for intervention purposes for several viruses
(Melby and Westby, 2009). CoVs use their glycosylated spike (S) protein to bind to their cognate cell
surface receptors and initiate membrane fusion and virus entry. For both SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2, the
S protein mediates entry into cells by binding to angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) via its receptorbinding domain (RBD) followed by proteolytic activation by human proteases (Lan et al., 2020; Matheson
and Lehner, 2020; Shang et al., 2020; Sivaraman et al., 2020). Blockade of this RBD–ACE2 protein-protein

interaction (PPI) can disrupt infection efficiency; for example, SARS-CoV-2 RBD protein was shown to block
S protein mediated SARS-CoV-2 pseudovirus entry into their respective ACE2 receptor-expressing target
cells (Tai et al., 2020). Antibodies can be quite effective PPI inhibitors, and they are highly target-specific
and relatively stable in vivo. However, they cannot reach intracellular targets and, as all other protein
therapies, are hindered by problems such as low solubility, propensity for immunogenicity, long
elimination half-lives, lack of oral bioavailability, product heterogeneity, and possible manufacturing and
storage stability issues. Since they are foreign proteins, they elicit strong immune response in certain
patients (Suntharalingam et al., 2006; Wadman, 2006; Leader et al., 2008), and even if approved for
clinical use, they tend to have more post-market safety issues than small-molecule drugs (Downing et al.,
2017). Small-molecule inhibitors (SMIs) are more challenging to identify for PPIs, but it is now well
established that they can be effective against certain PPIs and can offer useful alternatives. There are now
>40 PPIs targeted by SMIs that are in preclinical development, and two such SMIs are approved for clinical
use (venetoclax and lifitegrast) (Arkin and Wells, 2004; Milroy et al., 2014; Scott et al., 2016; Bojadzic and
Buchwald, 2018).
Due to our interest in the chemical space of organic dyes to identify potential SMIs for PPIs
(Margolles-Clark et al., 2009a; Margolles-Clark et al., 2009b; Ganesan et al., 2011; Song et al., 2014; Chen et
al., 2017; Bojadzic and Buchwald, 2018; Bojadzic et al., 2018), we initiated a screen of such compounds for
their ability to inhibit the interaction between SARS-CoV-2 spike protein and its cognate receptor ACE2,
which is the first critical step initiating the viral attachment and entry of this CoV. As part of this, we found
that methylene blue, a tricyclic phenothiazine compound approved for the treatment of acquired
methemoglobinemia and some other uses (Clifton and Leikin, 2003; Schirmer et al., 2011; Bistas and
Sanghavi, 2020), inhibits this interaction, and we have confirmed that it does so in a concentrationdependent manner. This can contribute to the antiviral activity of this inexpensive and widely available

dye-based drug against SARS-CoV-2 making it potentially useful in the prevention and treatment of COVID19, especially in non-industrialized nations.

MATERIALS AND METHODS
Binding Assays
Methylene blue and all other test compounds used here were obtained from Sigma-Aldrich (St.
Louis, MO, USA). ACE2-Fc and SARS-CoV-2 S1 or RBD with His tag proteins used in the binding assay were
obtained from SinoBiological (Wayne, PA, USA); catalog no. 10108-H05H, 40592-V08H, and 40591-V08H).
Binding inhibition assays were performed in a 96-well cell-free format similar to the one described before
(Margolles-Clark et al., 2009b; Ganesan et al., 2011; Song et al., 2014; Chen et al., 2017). Briefly, microtiter
plates (Nunc F Maxisorp, 96-well; Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA, USA) were coated overnight at
4 °C with 100 μL/well of Fc-conjugated ACE2 receptor diluted in PBS pH 7.2. This was followed by blocking
with 200 μL/well of SuperBlock (PBS) (Thermo Fisher Scientific) for 1 h at RT. Then, plates were washed
twice using washing solution (PBS pH 7.4, 0.05% Tween-20) and tapped dry before the addition of the
tagged ligand (SARS-CoV-2 S1 or RBD) and test compounds diluted in binding buffer (100 mM HEPES, pH
7.2) to give a total volume of 100 μL/well. After 1 h incubation, three washes were conducted, and a
further 1 h incubation with anti-His HRP conjugate diluted (1:2500) in SuperBlock (PBS) was used to detect
the bound His-tagged ligand. Plates were washed four times before the addition of 100 μL/well of HRP
substrate TMB (3,3′,5,5′-tetramethylbenzidine) and kept in the dark for up to 15 min. The reaction was
stopped using 20 μL of 1M H2SO4, and the absorbance value was read at 450 nm. The plated
concentrations of ACE2 receptor were 1.0 μg/mL for SARS-CoV-2 RBD and 2.0 μg/mL for SARS-CoV-2 S1.
The concentrations of the ligand used in the inhibitory assays were 0.5 μg/mL for RBD and 1.0 μg/mL for
S1. These values were selected following preliminary testing to optimize response (i.e., to produce a highenough signal at conditions close to half-maximal response, EC50). Binding assessments for CD40–CD40L

and TNF-R1–TNF-α were performed as previously described (Bojadzic et al., 2018). Stock solutions of
compounds at 10 mM in DMSO were used.

Statistics and Data Fitting
All binding inhibition and cell assays were tested in at least duplicate per plates, and assays were
performed as at least two independent experiments. As before (Ganesan et al., 2011; Song et al., 2014;
Chen et al., 2017), binding data were converted to percent inhibition and fitted with standard log inhibitor
vs. normalized response models (Buchwald, 2020) using nonlinear regression in GraphPad Prism
(GraphPad, La Jolla, CA, USA) to establish half-maximal (median) effective or inhibitory concentrations
(EC50, IC50).

RESULTS
As part of our work to identify SMIs for co-signaling PPIs that are essential for the activation and
control of immune cells, we discovered that the chemical space of organic dyes, which is particularly rich
in strong protein binders, can offer a useful starting point. Accordingly, it seemed logical to explore it for
possible inhibitors of the SARS-CoV-2 S protein – ACE2 PPI that is an essential first step for the viral entry
of this novel, highly infectious coronavirus. As a first step, we explored the feasibility of setting up a
screening assays using a cell-free ELISA-type 96-well format similar to those used in our previous works
with Fc-conjugated receptors coated on the plate and FLAG- or His-tagged ligands in the solution
(Margolles-Clark et al., 2009b; Ganesan et al., 2011; Song et al., 2014; Chen et al., 2017). To establish assay
conditions, we first performed concentration-response assessments using such a format with ACE2-Fc and
SARS-CoV-2 S1 or RBD with His tag, and they indicated that both bindings follow classic sigmoid patterns
with a slightly stronger binding for RBD than S1 (Figure 1). Fitting of data gave median effective
concentrations (EC50s) and hence binding affinity constant (Kd) estimates of 5 and 13 nM, respectively (127
and 1008 ng/mL) – in good agreement with the specifications of the manufacturer and published values

that are also in the low nanomolar range (4–90 nM), typically based on surface plasmon resonance (SPR)
studies (Sivaraman et al., 2020).
Accordingly, we can use this format for inhibitory screening, and we decided to use hACE2 with
SARS-CoV-2 RBD-His, as it showed stronger binding. In fact, this assay setup is very similar to one recently
shown to work as a specific and sensitive SARS-CoV-2 surrogate virus neutralization test based on
antibody-mediated blockage of this same PPI (CoV-S–ACE2) (Tan et al., 2020). With this setup in our hands,
we performed a preliminary screening of representative organic dyes from our in-house library plus a few
compounds that are or have been considered of possible interest in inhibiting SAR-CoV-2 by different
mechanisms of action, e.g., chloroquine, clemastine, and suramin (Colson et al., 2020; da Silva et al., 2020;
Gordon et al., 2020; McKee et al., 2020; Xiu et al., 2020). Screening at 5 µM indicated that most have no
activity and, hence, are unlikely to interfere with the S-protein – ACE2 binding needed for viral
attachment. Nevertheless, some showed activity; those of selected compounds of interest are shown in
Figure 2 together with corresponding chemical structures. Erythrosine B (ErB, FD&C red #3), an FDA
approved food colorant, was included as a possible positive control since we have shown it previously to
be a promiscuous PPI inhibitor together with other xanthene dyes (Ganesan et al., 2011), and it indeed
showed strong inhibition here. Of particular interest, methylene blue (MeBlu), which has a long history of
diverse medical applications (Clifton and Leikin, 2003; Schirmer et al., 2011; Bistas and Sanghavi, 2020),
also showed promising inhibitory activity.
Therefore, to confirm its activity, we performed detailed concentration-response assessments as
recommended per experimental guidelines in pharmacology and experimental biology (Curtis et al., 2018;
Michel et al., 2020). As shown in Figure 3, this confirmed that MeBlu indeed inhibits concentrationdependent manner an estimated IC50 of 3 μM, whereas chloroquine and suramin show no inhibitory
activity in this assay. Chloroquine, an anti-parasitic and immunosuppressive drug primarily used to
prevent and treat malaria, was included as it has potential antiviral activity against SARS-CoV-2 (subject

to controversies) (Colson et al., 2020). Suramin, an antiparasitic drug approved for the prophylactic
treatment of African sleeping sickness (trypanosomiasis) and river blindness (onchocerciasis), was
incorporated because it was claimed to inhibit SARS-CoV-2 infection in cell culture most likely by
preventing binding or entry of the virus (da Silva et al., 2020) (as well as because we found it earlier to
inhibit the CD40–CD40L PPI (Margolles-Clark et al., 2009a)). ErB also inhibited with an IC50 of 0.4 µM,
which is consistent with our previous observation of promiscuous PPI inhibition by this compound with a
possibly slightly higher activity than found for other PPIs tested before (1–20 µM) (Ganesan et al., 2011).
Sunset yellow FCF (FD&C yellow #6), an azo dye and an FDA approved food colorant included as a possible
negative control, indeed showed no inhibitory activity. Since the IC50 obtained for MeBlu here (3 µM) is
within the range of its circulating levels following normal clinical dosage (e.g., peak blood concentration
of 19 μM after 500 mg p.o. with an elimination half-life of ~14 h (Walter-Sack et al., 2009) or trough levels
of 6–7 µM in healthy human volunteers following oral doses of 69 mg, t.i.d. = 207 mg/day (Baddeley et
al., 2015)), this inhibitory effect on viral attachment can contribute to the possible antiviral activity of
MeBlu against SARS-CoV-2 and possibly other ACE2-binding CoVs such as SARS-CoV and the α-coronavirus
HCoV NL63.

DISCUSSION
Results here confirm again the usefulness of our strategy to rely on the chemical space of organic
dyes, known to contain strong protein binders, as a starting platform to identify SMI scaffolds for PPI
inhibition. Using this strategy, we have achieved considerable progress in targeting co-signaling
interactions as we have identified the first SMIs for CD40–CD40L (Margolles-Clark et al., 2009b) and OX40–
OX40L PPIs (Song et al., 2014) as well as the first promiscuous SMIs of PPIs (Ganesan et al., 2011). Organic
dyes contain privileged structures for protein binding (Che et al., 2006; Fletcher and Hamilton, 2006;
Hershberger et al., 2007), and, contrary to usual drug-like libraries, whose chemical space does not

correspond well with that of promising PPI inhibitors (Neugebauer et al., 2007; Reynès et al., 2010;
Sperandio et al., 2010), they are a good starting point to identify SMIs of PPIs. Most dyes, however, are
unsuitable for therapeutic development because of their strong color and, in the case of azo dyes, their
quick metabolic degradation (Levine, 1991; Feng et al., 2012); hence further medicinal chemistry is
needed to optimize their clinical potential (Chen et al., 2017).
More importantly, our results indicate that MeBlu, an organic dye in clinical use for some
therapeutic applications in the developed world (Clifton and Leikin, 2003; Schirmer et al., 2011; Bistas and
Sanghavi, 2020) and with additional potential for certain developing world applications such as malaria
(Dicko et al., 2018), can inhibit the viral attachment and entry of SARS-CoV-2 by blocking the PPI of its
spike protein with ACE2 on the host cell. MeBlu is a tricyclic phenothiazine dye approved by the FDA for
clinical use for the treatment of methemoglobinemia, and it is also used for other applications such as
prevention of urinary tract infections in elderly patients; ifosfamid-induced neurotoxicity in cancer
patients; vasoplegic syndrome, a type of distributive shock that occurs during coronary procedures; and
intraoperative visualization of nerves, nerve tissues, and endocrine glands (Schirmer et al., 2011; Bistas
and Sanghavi, 2020). MeBlu is included in the WHO List of Essential Medicines and was, in fact, the very
first fully synthetic drug used in medicine, as it was used to treat malaria since 1891 (Schirmer et al., 2011).
This utilization spanned through WW2 until it was replaced by chloroquine; although, due to the blue
urine it could cause, MeBlu was not well liked among the soldiers (“Even at the loo we see, we pee, navy
blue”) (Schirmer et al., 2011). It also served as the lead compound for the development of chlorpromazine
and tricyclic antidepressants (Schirmer et al., 2011). Moreover, there is resurgent interest in its
antimalarial application (Dicko et al., 2018), and it has potential for the treatment of neurodegenerative
disorders such as Alzheimer’s disease (AD), due to its putative inhibitory action on the aggregation of tau
protein (Schirmer et al., 2011). Notably, MeBlu was also part of the first method developed for pathogen
inactivation in plasma, where it has been used since 1991 to inactivate viruses in combination with light

(Lozano et al., 2013). MeBlu intercalates within nucleic acid strands, and application of light causes its
excitation generating highly reactive singlet oxygen that oxidizes guanosine and breaks nucleic strands
(Lozano et al., 2013). Hence, in the presence of light, MeBlu has broad-spectrum virucidal activity and is
used to inactivate viruses in blood products prior to transfusions.
Notably, there is also recent evidence of possible in vitro antiviral activity for MeBlu even in the
absence of UV-induced activation, as MeBlu showed virucidal activity at low micromolar concentrations
when incubated with SARS-CoV-2 for 20 h in the dark (Cagno et al., 2020). Its ability to inhibit the SARSCoV-2-S – ACE2 PPI could be a mechanism of action contributing to such activity. If this PPI inhibitory
activity of MeBlu is retained at similar levels in vivo as found here in a cell-free assay (IC50 = 3 µM), it is
within a range that can be obtained in blood following typical doses (e.g., 200 mg/day) as indicated by
pharmacokinetic studies in humans. For example, in one study, peak blood concentration of MeBlu was
19 μM after 500 mg p.o., and the elimination half-life was also more than adequate being around 14 h
(Walter-Sack et al., 2009). In another study, trough levels of 6–7 µM were obtained following total daily
oral doses of 207 mg/day (administered as 69 mg, p.o., t.i.d.) (Baddeley et al., 2015). Hence, oral
administration could provide adequate concentrations (e.g., > 7 µM) and inhaled applications, which have
been explored in less developed countries for some respiratory treatments (Golwalkar, 2020), could be
even more advantageous. MeBlu is generally safe, but it shows dose-dependent toxicity with nausea,
vomiting, hemolysis, and other undesired side effects starting to occur at doses >7 mg/kg (i.e., >500 mg)
(Clifton and Leikin, 2003; Bistas and Sanghavi, 2020). It also is contraindicated in certain populations, e.g.,
in those taking serotonin reuptake inhibitors and in persons with hereditary glucose-6-phosphate
dehydrogenase deficiency (G6PD deficiency) (Schirmer et al., 2011; Bistas and Sanghavi, 2020).
It has to be noted, however, that MeBlu also inhibited the CD40–CD40L and TNF-R1–TNFα PPIs in
our assays with low- to mid-micromolar potency (data not shown); hence, it is possible that MeBlu is a
somewhat promiscuous PPI inhibitor limiting its usefulness. Its three-ring phenothiazine framework

resembles somewhat the three-ring xanthene framework of erythrosine B (Figure 2), which we have
shown before to act as promiscuous PPI inhibitor together with some other structural analog xanthene
dyes such as rose Bengal and phloxine (Ganesan et al., 2011). MeBlu certainly shows polypharmacology
and acts on a multitude of targets (Schirmer et al., 2011); many of these however can have further
beneficial effects in COVID-19 patients. Its main mechanism of action is reducing the oxidized ferric form
of hemoglobin (Fe3+) when in a state of methemoglobinemia, which binds oxygen irreversibly, to the
ferrous (Fe2+) form (Bistas and Sanghavi, 2020). This increases the oxygen-binding capacity of hemoglobin
and, thus, oxygen delivery to tissues – an important benefit for COVID-19 patients. COVID-19 patients
often exhibiting low oxygen levels, typically incompatible with life without dyspnea – a phenomenon
termed silent hypoxemia (or happy hypoxia in public media) (Tobin et al., 2020). Possibly relevant to this,
MeBlu was found to improve hypoxemia and hyperdynamic circulation in patients with liver cirrhosis and
severe hepatopulmonary syndrome (Schenk et al., 2000). MeBlu is being used for the treatment of
pneumonia and other respiratory ailments in less developed countries with some success (Golwalkar,
2020).
Further, MeBlu was recently shown to block the PD-1–SHP2 PPI, which is downstream from the
PD-1–PD-L1 co-signaling PPI, with low micromolar potency and effectively enough to counteract the
suppressive activity of PD-1 on cytotoxic T lymphocytes and restore their cytotoxicity, activation,
proliferation, and cytokine-secreting activity (Fan et al., 2020). This mechanism of action targeting this cosignaling pathway (PD-1) could contribute to restoring T cell homeostasis and function from exhausted
state (Barber et al., 2006; Vardhana and Wolchok, 2020), which is of interest to improve viral clearance
and rein-in the inflammatory immune response and the associated cytokine storm during anti-viral
responses such as those causing the high mortality of COVID-19 patients (Liu et al., 2020; Ye et al., 2020).
As far as clinical applications, one promising indication comes from a report of a cohort of 2500
French patients treated with MeBlu as part of their cancer care none of whom developed influenza like

illness during the COVID-19 epidemics (Henry et al., 2020). MeBlu has also been explored in one Phase 1
clinical trial (NCT04370288) for treatment of critically ill COVID-19 patients in Iran as part of a three-drug
last therapeutic option add-on cocktail (MeBlu 1 mg/kg, vitamin C 1500 mg/kg, and N-acetyl cysteine 2000
mg/kg) based on the hypothesis that this combination could rebalance NO, methemoglobin, and oxidative
stress. Four of the five patients responded well to treatment (Alamdari et al., 2020).
In conclusion, screening of our organic dye-based library identified MeBlu as a low-micromolar
inhibitor of the interaction between SARS-CoV-2 spike protein and its cognate receptor ACE2, a PPI that is
the first critical step initiating the viral entry of this coronavirus. While MeBlu shows strong
polypharmacology and might be a somewhat promiscuous PPI inhibitor, its ability to inhibit this PPI could
contribute to the antiviral activity of MeBlu against SARS-CoV-2 even in the absence of light making this
inexpensive and widely available drug potentially useful in the prevention and treatment of COVID-19 as
an oral or inhaled medication.
