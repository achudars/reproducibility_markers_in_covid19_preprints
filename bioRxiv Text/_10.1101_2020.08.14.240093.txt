Abstract
The COVID-19 pandemic is caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2
(SARS-CoV-2) which enters the body principally through the nasal and larynx mucosa and
progress to the lungs through the respiratory tract. SARS-CoV-2 replicates efficiently in
respiratory epithelial cells motivating the development of alternative and rapidly scalable
vaccine inducing mucosal protective and long-lasting immunity. We have previously developed
an immunologically optimized multi-neoepitopes-based peptide vaccine platform which has
already demonstrated tolerance and efficacy in hundreds of lung cancer patients. Here, we
present a multi-target CD8 T cell peptide COVID-19 vaccine design targeting several structural
(S, M, N) and non-structural (NSPs) SARS-CoV-2 proteins with selected epitopes in conserved
regions of the SARS-CoV-2 genome. We observed that a single subcutaneous injection of a
serie of epitopes induces a robust immunogenicity in-vivo as measured by IFNγ ELIspot. Upon
tetramer characterization we found that this serie of epitopes induces a strong proportion of
virus-specific CD8 T cells expressing CD103, CD44, CXCR3 and CD49a, the specific
phenotype of tissue-resident memory T lymphocytes (Trm). Finally, we observed broad cellular
responses, as characterized by IFNγ production, upon restimulation with structural and nonstructural protein-derived epitopes using blood T cells isolated from convalescent
asymptomatic, moderate and severe COVID-19 patients. These data provide insights for further
development of a second generation of COVID-19 vaccine focused on inducing lasting Th1biased memory CD8 T cell sentinels protection using immunodominant epitopes naturally
observed after SARS-CoV-2 infection resolution.

Statement of Significance
Humoral and cellular adaptive immunity are different and complementary immune defenses
engaged by the body to clear viral infection. While neutralizing antibodies have the capacity to
block virus binding to its entry receptor expressed on human cells, memory T lymphocytes have
the capacity to eliminate infected cells and are required for viral clearance. However, viruses
evolve quickly, and their antigens are prone to mutations to avoid recognition by the antibodies
(phenomenon named ‘antigenic drift’). This limitation of the antibody-mediated immunity
could be addressed by the T-cell mediated immunity, which is able to recognize conserved viral
peptides from any viral proteins presented by virus-infected cells. Thus, by targeting several
proteins and conserved regions on the genome of a virus, T-cell epitope-based vaccines are less
subjected to mutations and may work effectively on different strains of the virus. We designed
a multi-target T cell-based vaccine containing epitope regions optimized for CD8+ T cell
stimulation that would drive long-lasting cellular immunity with high specificity, avoiding
undesired effects such as antibody-dependent enhancement (ADE) and antibody-induced
macrophages hyperinflammation that could be observed in subjects with severe COVID-19.
Our in-vivo results showed that a single injection of selected CD8 T cell epitopes induces
memory viral-specific T-cell responses with a phenotype of tissue-resident memory T cells
(Trm). Trm has attracted a growing interest for developing vaccination strategies since they act
as immune sentinels in barrier tissue such as the respiratory tract and the lung. Because of their
localization in tissues, they are able to immediately recognize infected cells and, because of
their memory phenotypes, they rapidly respond to viral infection by orchestrating local
protective immune responses to eliminate pathogens. Lastly, such multiepitope-based
vaccination platform uses robust and well-validated synthetic peptide production technologies
that can be rapidly manufactured in a distributed manner.

Introduction
COVID-19, the infectious disease caused by the zoonotic coronavirus SARS-CoV-2, is a global
pandemic which has infected more than 16 million of individuals and already caused up to 650
000 deaths worldwide as of end of July 2020. The severity of the COVID-19 outbreak highlights
the need to develop therapeutic interventions including fast and efficacious prophylactic
vaccines. Previous severe outbreaks of coronavirus (CoVs) have emerged including Severe
acute respiratory syndrome CoV (SARS-CoV-1) in 2002 and Middle East Respiratory
Syndrome CoV (MERS-CoV) in 2012. Learnings from current (SARS-CoV-2) and previous
(SARS-CoV-1, MERS-CoV) infections argue that the body develops humoral and cellular
immune responses against this type of respiratory viruses but that antibody responses are shortterm1–5 in contrast to the cellular immunity which is still observed 11 and 17 years after the
infection6,7.

Current and previous CoVs vaccine strategies have been almost exclusively focused on eliciting
a humoral immune response, particularly anti-Spike neutralizing IgG antibody. However, the
generation of non-neutralizing antibody responses8, insufficient antibody titers9, Th2-biased
immune response or glycosylation changes in the IgG Fc tail10 may be associated with vaccine
failure, and in the worst case scenario may enhance disease upon viral exposure, either through
the induction of enhanced pulmonary macrophage-mediated hyper-inflammation11, or Fc
receptor-mediated antibody-dependent enhancement (ADE)12. Th1-biasing immunization
using CD8 T cells optimized peptide vaccination may offer an important alternative and
complementary approach with a history of safe administration, may be developed and updated
rapidly, and should avoid safety pitfalls in the pursuit of a COVID-19 vaccine8,13,14.

The discovery of memory T lymphocytes resident in diverse tissues, in particular mucosal and
barrier tissues, has highlighted the importance of site-specific responses and continuous
surveillance mediated by a specific tissue-resident memory T cell population (Trm)15–17. A
couple of studies demonstrated that after induction Trm migrate and reside in the lung, skin,
and gut long after infection resolution and provide localized protective immunity and
immunosurveillance in tissues18–21. Trm represents an attractive target population and a
growing interest for developing vaccine strategies since they act as immune sentinels in
mucosal and barrier tissue and rapidly respond to infection by orchestrating local protective
immune responses to eliminate pathogens22. Previous CD8 T cell-based vaccines against
SARS-CoV-123 and influenza A24 viruses showed lasting virus-specific memory CD8 T cells
induction in the spleen, lung and bronchoalveolar fluids (BALs) and protection of mice from
lethal SARS-CoV-1 or influenza challenges. Expression of chemokine receptors, such as
CXCR3, is critical for CD8+ Trm to populate the airways after vaccination and protection
against influenza A viruses25. More recently, a Trm-inducing HIV vaccine durably prevented
mucosal infection in non-human primates even with lower neutralizing antibody titers26.
Altogether, these data emphasize the interest of tissue-resident memory viral-specific CD8 T
cell generation upon vaccination for optimal protection against airways viruses.

Stimulation of a proper immune response that leads to protection is highly dependent on
presentation of epitopes to circulating T-cells via the HLA complex. MEMOPI® is a robust
vaccine platform based on selection and immunogenicity optimization of HLA-restricted
peptides (neo-epitope) technologies27,28 and formulation29 for multi-epitopes and targets
combination with a pan-DR helper epitope (PADRE) providing help for memory CD8 T cell
generation30. A combination of multi-target antitumor neo-epitopes, Tedopi®, based on this
platform already demonstrated good safety profile and efficacy in clinical Phase 2 trial31 and

more recently successfully validated in the first step of a Phase 3 clinical testing in lung cancer
paients32. While induction of mucosal immunity using parenteral administration of
conventional virus vaccine technologies was challenging, we observed that subcutaneous
injection of our neo-epitopes multi-target cancer vaccine promotes Th1-biased antigen-specific
memory CD8 T cell responses in the lung and BALs of vaccinated mice in the absence of tumor.
Based on this original preclinical observation and the significant survival increase measured
during clinical trials in lung cancer patients correlating with epitope responses, we generated
and screened individually a large number of immuno-dominant SARS-CoV-2 epitopes, and
their neo-epitopes generated using artificial intelligence (AI) algorithms, covering all
sequenced circulating SARS-CoV-2 strains and derived from 11 structural (including Spike)
and non-structural proteins with significant homology with previous SARS-CoV-1 virus.

Results

CD8 T-cell epitopes selection and neo-epitopes design
Previous research in SARS-CoV-1 suggests that the structural Spike (S) protein is one of the
main antigenic component responsible for inducing the host immune responses33. However
recent evaluation of asymptomatic, moderate and severe convalescent COVID-19 patients
showed broad and robust T-cell responses not only on Spike but also on membrane (M),
nucleocapsid (N) proteins and several ORFs non-structural proteins (nsp)34–37. Deep sequencing
data of tens of thousands SARS-CoV-2 genomes from all over the world identified regions that
have remained largely invariant to date, and others that have already accumulated significant
diversity with several hundreds of point mutations (SNPs) in some key viral proteins, such as
the Spike glycoprotein which also displayed a large number of recurrent mutations and several
homoplasic sites highlighting a possible convergent evolution and adaptation of SARS-CoV-2
to the human host38–41. COVID-19 vaccines reliance on a single antigen (Spike) bearing
recurrent mutations and homoplasic sites, as occurring with Spike monovalent vaccines under
development, is not without risk of antigen drift, selection pressure and immune evasion42.

Using bioinformatics approaches of immune deconvolution to identify T cell epitopes
intersected with predicted SARS-CoV-2 T-cell epitopes reported in early manuscripts43–49,
population HLA diversity, protein sequence similarity and immunogenicity observed with
previous CoVs homologues and the number of copies per virion of SARS-COV-150,51
(estimated to approximatively 100 copies for S, 1000 for M, 2000 for N and only 20 for E
proteins), we identified and selected 55 HLA-A*0201-restricted T-cell epitopes (9-10 mer
peptides) derived from 11 of the 29 SARS-CoV-2 proteins in human cells52: 3 out of the 4
structural proteins (S, M, N), the largest accessory proteins (ORF3a) and 7 out of the 16

ORF1a/b non-structural proteins (nsp3, nsp4, nsp6, nsp12, nsp13, nsp14, nsp16) (Figure 1 and
Table 1). Based on our knowledge of key fixed-anchor positions to enhance HLA binding and
increase their immunogenicity potential, we designed 400 mutated sequences for each
individual peptide resulting in 22 000 total analyzed sequences of the 55 selected epitopes. We
first screened these potential peptides using in-silico bioinformatic analyses (e.g. IEDB Immune
epitope database, netMHCpan EL 4.0 algorithm) and a first series of the most optimized mutant
for each epitope was selected (neo-epitopes A). In parallel, 22000 in silico HLA-A*0201peptide docking models were generated using computational tools and analyzed using newly
developed proprietary artificial intelligence (AI) algorithms based on binding energy
calculations and reduction (MabSilico, France). A second series of the most optimized mutant
for each epitope was selected (neo-epitopes B). Finally, SARS-CoV-2 genetic evolution
analyses through the alignment of 46723 sequences (https://macman123.shinyapps.io/ugiscov2-alignment-screen/) identified recurrent mutation (SNPs) and homoplasic site in SARSCoV-2 genomes isolated globally, particularly in the Spike protein which contain the D614G
mutation and which identified the new dominant SARS-CoV-2 variant emerged in February in
Europe, then spread worldwide and became the most prevalent form62,63. We eliminated T cell
epitopes with recurrent mutation and homoplasic site in order to cover all circulating SARSCoV-2 strains and anticipate future evolution of the virus in hotspot mutation regions.

in-vivo immunogenicity). HLA-A2 binding was increased with several neoepitopes A and/or
B, particularly when the corresponding WT peptide showed weak (< 15%: peptides 2, 9, 12,
24, 29 and 35) or intermediate (15-30%: peptides 4, 14, 16, 18 and 48) HLA-A2 stability at
37°C. Similarly, several neoepitopes A increased peptide binding to HLA-A2 expressing
human cells (TAP-deficient human cell line (T2) lacking the ability to transport peptide
fragments to the endoplasmic reticulum to form stable pMHCI) particularly when the
corresponding WT peptide showed low (< 30%: peptides 34, 39) or intermediate (30-60%:
peptides 4, 5, 21, 26, 38) HLA-A2 stability at 37°C (Figure 2B). Altogether, bioinformatic and
AI-based mutation increased peptides stability with HLA-A2 (recombinant or expressed by
cells) for 52% (26/50) of evaluated CD8 T-cell epitopes.

Finally, 60 peptides (at least one WT or mutated peptides for each T-cell epitopes outside
homoplasic site) has been selected based on HLA-A2 binding, peptide stability and SARSCoV-2 genome stability for further in-vivo immunogenicity evaluation in HLA-A2.1 transgenic
mice. Mice received a single subcutaneous injection of each peptide combined with the
universal PADRE helper T-cell epitope30 and emulsified in Montanide ISA-51 adjuvant.
Immunogenicity was assessed in the spleen and draining lymph nodes 15 days after vaccination
by ex-vivo ELIspot restimulation with the corresponding WT peptide to evaluate crossreactivity of elicited T cell response towards WT epitopes. IFNγ ELIspot after CD8 T cells
restimulation showed large immunogenicity in-vivo responses elicited by single vaccination
with 35 out of 60 (58%) positive CD8 T cells epitopes derived from all of the 11 selected
proteins (Figure 3A). Similarly, broad immunogenicity response was observed by HLAA*0201-tetramer flow cytometry analyses to a higher number of epitopes since 44 out of 60
(73%) evaluated peptides, derived from 10 out of the 11 selected proteins, exhibited significant
frequency (0.1-1%) of viral-specific CD8 T cells (Figure 3B). Phenotypic characterization of

Tetramer+ cells showed that 17 out of 44 (39%) positive peptides elicited viral-specific CD8 T
cells with mainly a Trm phenotype: co-expressing the memory marker CD44, the CD103 αE
integrin, the Th1-biased CXCR3 chemokine receptor and to a lesser extent the CD49a α1
integrin (Figure 4). Altogether, these data showed that optimized peptide vaccination against
selected SARS-CoV-2 epitopes elicits robust and broad Th1-biased immunogenicity against
several structural (S, M, N) and non-structural proteins in HLA-A2 expressing mice and that
several peptides induce viral-specific memory CD8 T cells displaying all characteristics of T
lymphocyte sentinels in barrier tissues.

CD8 T-cell epitopes ex-vivo reactivity in asymptomatic and convalescent COVID-19
individuals compared to unexposed healthy donors
In order to identify and select naturally SARS-CoV-2 CD8 T cell immunodominant epitopes,
peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) from asymptomatic and moderate or severe
COVID-19 patients with a previously confirmed (at least one month before sampling) and
recovered SARS-CoV-2 infection were restimulated ex-vivo for one week with each of the 60
selected peptides derived from 11 proteins of SARS-COV-2. IFNγ responses over 48 hours of
restimulation with HLA-A2+ Tap-deficient (T2) human cells were analyzed and compared to
IFNγ responses of of unexposed healthy donors. The serology of all unexposed healthy donors
was negative while all asymptomatic, moderate and severe COVID-19 individuals were IgG+
for anti-Spike antibodies. As recently reported for CD4+ T cells response64,65, we first observed
some positive IFNγ response in unexposed donors to few CD8 T cells epitopes, in particular
for those derived from structural Spike and N proteins (Figure 5). No response to the
Spike_RBD or M structural proteins were observed in unexposed individuals, while CD8 T cell
responses to non-structural proteins were limited to nsp12 and nsp13. In contrast, broad positive
IFNγ response was reproducibly measured against 43 out of 60 selected CD8 T cells epitopes

derived from all evaluated SARS-CoV-2 proteins (n=11) in convalescent subjects of moderate
or severe COVID-19 as well as in asymptomatic individuals but to a lesser extent.

Altogether, when we compared convalescent SARS-CoV-2 individuals to unexposed healthy
donors, we identified 25 significantly different CD8 T cell immunodominant epitopes against
3 structural proteins (S, M, N), 1 accessory factor (ORF3a) and 7 non-structural proteins (nsp3,
nsp4, nsp6, nsp12, nsp13, nsp14, nsp16). 16 of these epitopes are of particular interest for
vaccination since they were able to elicit also in-vivo immunogenicity (Elispot response)
against all 11 structural and non-structural SARS-CoV-2 proteins after a single peptide
injection. Finally, we selected a combination of 12 CD8 T cells epitopes based on
manufacturing facilities, HLA-I coverage, previous CoVs homology and SARS-CoV-2 proteins
diversity considerations (Table 2). These 12 epitopes covered the 11 selected proteins, 1
epitope/protein excepting Spike for which 2 epitopes (including 1 RBD epitope) have been
selected. Bioinformatic analyses illustrate these 12 epitopes are not restricted only to the HLAA*0201 allele, hence are predict (netMHCpan score < 1) to bind efficiently to different HLA-I
(A, B, C) alleles with high genetic coverage in all geographical region of the world. Despite
HLA polymorphism and different worldwide HLA-I distribution, the combination of these 12
T cell epitopes should induce at least 1 to 4 positive peptide responses in all individuals globally
and achieve the 60-70% ‘herd immunity’ threshold66 with at least 4 to 5 positive peptide
responses in each geographical region (Table 3).

Discussion
Here we report a differentiated SARS-COV-2 vaccine design based on memory T-cell induction
technology. Using sequence design through reverse vaccinology selection approach based on
previous CoVs knowledge on immunodominant epitopes and computational immunology
optimization, we developed a combination of 12 CD8 T cell synthetic peptides originating from
11 SARS-CoV-2 structural and non-structural proteins capable to cover HLA polymorphism
with high coverage globally and to induce immunogenicity to different proteins independently
of HLA alleles expression. These epitopes are naturally immunogenic after SARS-COV-2
infection in recovered individuals and, for most of them, elicit a specialized sub-population of
viral-specific memory CD8 T cells with a tissue-resident phenotype hence capable to migrate,
stay attached and patrolling in airways barrier tissues.

Current vaccine approaches using various technology have already showed great anti-Spike
antibody induction in Phase 1 and Phase 2 clinical trials as well as some interesting effector T
cell responses against the vaccine antigen however without any indication of lasting memory T
cell response 67–70. Furthermore, this first generation of vaccines are all monovalent, targeting
only the Spike or a part of the Spike structural protein and built in urgency using the first Wuhan
SARS-CoV-2 sequence. Genomic diversity and hotspot mutations analyses in up to 30000
SARS-CoV-2 genomes, illustrated that the virus had undergone mutations several times already
in the last months71, adapting itself to its new host, and that new strains bearing significant
Spike mutation (e.g. D614G) have emerged, spread globally and became the most prevalent
form63. Once a mutated virus infects the host cells by escaping the antibodies, it then relies upon
the T cell mediated immunity to fight against the virus. Viral proteins are processed into short
peptides inside the infected cells and then loaded onto major histocompatibility complexes
(MHC) proteins. After that, the MHC-peptide complexes are presented on the infected cell
surface for recognition by specific T cells. For a universal vaccine, it is hence essential to

understand genetic evolution and stability of the virus and to select immunodominant T cell
epitopes that originate from conserved regions of the virus covering all circulating strains of
SARS-CoV-2 and anticipating future mutation and evolution of the virus which appear more
likely in hotspot regions. Similarly, multi-target vaccine are less susceptible to antigenic-drift
and virus evasion after immune pression to a single antigen such as with monovalent vaccine.

The discovery of T cells as residents in tissues has initiated a paradigm shift in the way we
study and understand T cell–mediated immunity: from a circulating and surveilling population
transiting through barrier tissues to patrolling sentinels at the interface with the outside
environment15–17. Trm act as immune sentinels and rapidly respond to infection by orchestrating
local protective immune responses to eliminate pathogens. Because of their localization directly
in tissues, they are able to immediately recognize infected cells or their cognate antigens
presented by antigen-presenting cells. Trm protective immunity have been demonstrating to a
number of infectious pathogens (viruses, bacteria, fungi, and parasites) in diverse sites such as
mucosal and barrier sites (lung, skin, and intestines). In the lung, Trm mediate optimal
protection against respiratory viruses such as influenza and respiratory syncytial virus (RSV),
whereas circulating memory T cells and neutralizing antibodies appear to be dispensable21,72–
74

. Numerous findings indicate now the importance of both CD4+ and CD8+ Trm in tissue-

localized immunity to pathogens, with CD8+ Trm more prevalent in viral and parasitic
infections whereas CD4+ Trm mediate protection to bacterial and fungal invaders17.
Furthermore, the CXCR3 chemokine receptor have been reported to be expressed on human
lung T-cells and demonstrated to play a significant roles in T-cell homing to the lung
parenchyma and ariway since CXCR3 inhibition prevents airway immune responses and
vaccine-induced T cell entry to the lung mucosal compartments75–79. Here we showed that, as
previously observed with our MEMOPI®-based neoepitope cancer vaccine approach, several

peptides induced viral-specific CD8 T cells expressing the E (CD103) and α1 (CD49a) integrins
and the CD44 memory marker, altogether characteristic of Trm. These cells express also the
CXCR3 marker of chemoattraction, which is also a surrogate marker of Th1 CD8 T cells since
CXCR3 is transactivate directly by the Th1 master gene T-bet79. CD103 and CD49a expression
are key molecules in Trm biology since providing them the capacity of interaction, adherence
and mobility with mucosal tissues, in particular epithelial cells and collagen directly underlying
epithelial cells80,81.

To summarize, this differentiated Th1-biased memory CD8 T cell SARS-CoV-2 vaccine has
been developed using reverse vaccinology selection approach, computational immunology
optimization and synthetic peptide synthesis technology. The development of inactivated virus
vaccine, besides Good Manufacturing Practices (GMP) system, require extremely high
manufacture standard to avoid medical accidents due to the failure of complete inactivation of
virus toxicity. Furthermore, different from nucleic acid (e.g. RNA) vaccines, peptide vaccine
has relatively more mature manufacturing process. The successful launch of previous peptide
vaccines has already demonstrated the safety and efficacy of peptide-based vaccines. The first
generation of SARS-CoV-2 vaccine has been based on the first SARS-CoV-2 Wuhan sequence
and target only one antigen. Here we propose a second generation of SARS-CoV-2 vaccine
taking into consideration virus genetic evolution these last 6 months after global spreading and
which targets different structural and key non-structural proteins in stable genome sequence
region to cover all circulating SARS-CoV-2 strains and anticipate future virus evolution.
Selected T cell epitopes display also very high homology with previous pandemic coronavirus
(SARS-CoV-1 and MERS-CoV) and hence may be suitable and ready for future anticipated

Methods

Study Approval
Animal housing and procedures have been conducted according to the guidelines of the French
Agriculture Ministry and were approved by the regional ethical committee (APAFIS 25256.)
as well as according to the guidelines of Jackson Laboratory (Bar Harbor, USA) and approved
by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee (IACUC #20031). Human studies were
performed under the clinical protocol COVEPIT-1 approved by French Central Ethic
Committee (CPP) and registered by the French Regulatory Authority (ANSM) under the IDRCB n° 2020-A01654-35. Written informed consent has been obtained from each of the
participating subject.

HLA-A*0201-peptide binding evaluation
T-cell WT and mutated peptides binding property on HLA-A2 has been evaluated using the
Flex-T HLA-A*02:01 monomer ultraviolet (UV) exchange assay according to the manufacturer
recommendation (Biolegend, San Diego, USA). HLA-A*02:01 monomer (200 µg/ml) were
exposed to a 366-nm UV lamp in the presence or absence of 400 µM of peptide. After UVexposure, HLA-peptide complexes were incubated at 37°C for 30 min to promote unfolding of
peptide-free HLA molecule. HLA-peptide complexes stability was detected by ELISA with β2microglobulin coated antibodies and incubation of 3 ng/ml of complexes for 1h at room
temperature under shaking condition. Avidin-HRP were used to reveal stable biotinylated
HLA-peptide complexes and absorbance was monitored at 450 nm. Data are expressed as
percentage of binding relative to an MEMOPI® internal positive control neoepitope.

SARS-CoV-2 genome diversity evaluation
A visualization tool was used to determine T-cell and B-cell epitope location in SARS-CoV-2
genomes according to single nucleotide polymorphism (SNPs) and homoplasic site
(https://macman123.shinyapps.io/ugi-scov2-alignment-screen/)85.

46723

SARS-CoV-2

genomes isolated from patients worldwide were aligned against the Wuhan-Hu-1 reference
genome NC_045512.2. A total of 12706 SNPs has been identified corresponding to 398
homoplasic sites with recurrent mutations. Peptides have been blasted with tblastn algorithm
against the Wuhan-Hu-1 reference genome NC_045512.2 to determine the nucleotide
coordinates for each peptide. The online tool was then used to identify the peptides
corresponding to a homoplasic site.

T-cell epitopes immunization
B6.Cg-Immp2lTg(HLA-A/H2-D)2Enge/J (HLA-A2.1) transgenic mice (JAX # 004191, The Jackson
Laboratory, Bar Harbor, USA) received a single subcutaneous injection of 6 SARS-CoV-2
peptides (50µg each, WT and mutated peptide of a same epitope have not been evaluated in
same mice) plus the universal PADRE helper T-cell epitope30 emulsified in Montanide ISA-51
adjuvant. Immunization was measured 15 days after injection. 3 males and 3 females have been
evaluated per group. Freshly harvested spleen and draining lymph nodes have been pooled by
sex per group and analyzed by flow cytometry analyses. CD8+ T cells have been isolated using
MACS microbeads and restimulated individualy with each evaluated peptide. The frequency of
IFNγ-secreting CD8+ T cells was measured by ELIspot in parallel of tetramer staining for each
peptide evaluated by flow cytometry.

COVID-19 patient cohorts
All subjects were enrolled in the COVEPIT-1 clinical trial, an open-label, multicentric and
prospective study with minimal risk and constraints designed to assess the memory T cell in
subjects who recovered from COVID-19. Subjects were enrolled at the Groupement Santé du
Bataillon des Marins-Pompiers (Marseille-France) and GHR MSA– Hôpital Emile Muller
(Mulhouse, France). The main objective was to test the subject’ memory T cells reactivity to a
selection of SARS-CoV-2 antigens. Enrolled subjects must have a proven COVID-19 infection
which recovered 1 to 6 months before study entry. Eligible subjects are male and female of 18
to 70 years old diagnosed for COVID-19 using a PCR test from a nasal and/or oropharyngeal
swab, and/or a serological test, and/or a chest CT with lesions suggestive of COVID-19.
Subjects were excluded if pregnant or breastfeeding, unable to fulfill the protocol requirement,
with an history of cancer 5 years prior to study entry (except for localized or in situ cancer),
history of head injury or sepsis 1 year prior to study entry, chronic infections (e.g. HIV
infection, chronic hepatitis B, active viral hepatitis C or bacterial or fungal infection) requiring
a systemic treatment in the month prior to COVID-19, disease (auto immune or inflammatory
disease, transplant recipients…) requiring a immunosuppressive or immunomodulator
treatment and/or, corticosteroids at an equivalent dose of prednisone >10mg/d for more than 15
days or > 40 mg/d for the last 15 days prior to COVID-19; corticosteroid during COVID-19
were not considered as an exclusion criterion.

Ex-vivo PBMC restimulation with SARS-CoV-2 peptide
PBMC were isolated after a Ficoll density-gradient centrifugation and a red blood cell lysis.
HLA-A2 phenotyping was performed by flow cytometry (clone BB7.2, BD Bioscience). Exvivo stimulation protocol was adapted from a previously described protocol86. HLA-A2+
positive PBMC (106/well) were incubated in RPMI 1640 containing 10 mM HEPES, 2 mM L18

glutamine, 1mM Sodium Pyruvate, 2% human AB serum, 10% bovine serum and non-essential
amino acids in 48-well plates. During the first week of culture, PBMC were cultured with
3µg/mL of each isolated peptides and IL-21 (30ng/mL; Miltenyi, Paris France). Fresh medium
containing IL-21 (30 ng/mL), IL-7 (5 ng/mL; BioRad, Paris France), and IL-2 (10 ng/mL;
Miltenyi, Paris France) and peptide-loaded HLA-A2+ Tap-deficient (T2) cells were added to
the culture for the next two days. Ex vivo T-cell viral stimulation was evaluated by IFN
supernatant quantification (BD Biosciences, US). The percentage of background IFN secretion
was determined by the response of PBMC co-cultured with non-loaded T2 cells and negative
control peptide, then fold change was calculated over the IFN secretion background for each
donors.

Statistical analysis
Continuous variables were expressed as the mean ± SEM, unless otherwise indicated, and raw
data were compared with nonparametric tests: Mann-Whitney for 2 groups or Kruskall-Wallis
with Dunn’s comparison when the number of groups was > 2. P values of <0.05 were considered
statistically significant. All statistical analyses were performed on GraphPad Software
(GraphPad Software, San Diego, CA).

Figure 2: HLA-A2 binding characterization of WT and mutated T-cell epitopes
(A) WT and mutated peptides were incubated with HLA-A*02:01 monomer, exposed to UV
for peptide exchange and then HLA-peptide complexes stability at 37°C was measured by
ELISA. Data are mean +/- SEM (n=4) expressed as percentage of binding relative to an internal
MEMOPI® positive control neoepitope. (B) WT and mutated peptides (25µM) binding to TAPdeficient human cell line (T2) expressing HLA-A2. Data are expressed as percentage of binding
relative to an internal MEMOPI® positive control neoepitope. X mark indicates that the peptide
was not tested in the assay.

Figure 3: T-cell epitope vaccination elicits broad SARS-CoV-2 protein immunogenicity in-vivo
(A) IFNγ Elispot responses of pooled spleen and draining lymph nodes cells were restimulated for 24 hours with each of the isolated peptides. Data
are mean +/- SEM (n=6). Medium level: Three-fold background. High level: Nine-fold background (B) Frequency of Tetramer+ CD8 T cells (gating
strategy in Figure 4A). Medium and High response threshold were defined based on 2-fold or 3-fold increase respectively compared to the
background frequency measured in the non-vaccinated mice control group. Controls+ are MEMOPI® peptides with previously validated
immunogenicity. Data are mean +/- SD of pooled female (n=3) and pooled male (n=3) vaccinated mice. Medium level: Two-fold background.
High level: Three-fold background
