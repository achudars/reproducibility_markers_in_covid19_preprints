Abstract
Multiple publications have independently described pangolin CoV genomes from the same batch
of smuggled pangolins confiscated in Guangdong province in March, 2019. We analyzed the three
metagenomic datasets that sampled this batch of pangolins and found that the two complete
pangolin CoV genomes, GD_1 by Xiao et al. Nature and MP789 by Liu et al. PLoS Pathogens,
were both built primarily using the 2019 dataset first described by Liu et al. Viruses. Other
publications, such as Zhang et al. Current Biology and Lam et al. Nature, have also relied on this
same dataset by Liu et al. Viruses for their assembly of the Guangdong pangolin CoV sequences
and comparisons to SARS-CoV-2. To our knowledge, all of the published pangolin CoV genome
sequences that share a highly similar Spike receptor binding domain with SARS-CoV-2 originate
from this singular batch of smuggled pangolins. This raises the question of whether pangolins are
truly reservoirs or hosts of SARS-CoV-2-related coronaviruses in the wild, or whether the
pangolins may have contracted the CoV from another host species during trafficking. Our
observations highlight the importance of requiring authors to publish their complete genome
assembly pipeline and all contributing raw sequence data, particularly those supporting
epidemiological investigations, in order to empower peer review and independent analysis of the
sequence data. This is necessary to ensure both the accuracy of the data and the conclusions
presented by each publication.

Several studies describing pangolin CoV genomes have posited that pangolins are potentially
important hosts in the emergence of novel coronaviruses. There has been particular emphasis on
the discovery of a Guangdong pangolin CoV that shares all five critical residues and ~97% amino
acid identity in the Spike receptor binding domain (RBD) with SARS-CoV-2.1–3 This is due to the
fact that the Spike RBD plays a major role in determining the host specificity of each coronavirus.
The next closest match to SARS-CoV-2 in terms of the Spike RBD is the bat CoV RaTG13,
sharing 90.13% Spike RBD amino acid identity. RaTG13 shares the highest genome identity to
SARS-CoV-2 (96%), whereas the Guangdong pangolin CoV shares ~90% genome identity with
SARS-CoV-2. Nonetheless, based on Spike RBD similarity, many have hypothesized that
pangolins could have been an intermediate host of SARS-CoV-2 that later transmitted into
humans.
The Guangdong pangolin CoV, obtained from a batch of 21 smuggled pangolins in Guangdong
province in March, 2019, was originally described in October, 2019 by Liu et al. Viruses.4 Since
then, Liu et al. PLoS Pathogens,1 Xiao et al. Nature,2 Zhang et al. Current Biology,3 and Lam et
al. Nature5 have each analyzed CoV sequences from this same batch of pangolins. In addition,
Lam et al. describe CoVs from another batch of smuggled pangolins in Guangxi province.
However, these Guangxi pangolin CoVs do not share such a high level of Spike RBD identity
(only 86-87% amino acid identity) with SARS-CoV-2. The Guangdong pangolin CoV sequences
have already been utilized across numerous other studies. Therefore, we analyzed the
contributions of individual sequences from each study to identify the most representative
Guangdong pangolin CoV genome for use by the research community.
During this process, we were surprised to find that Xiao et al. assembled their genome GD_1
(GISAID: EPI_ISL_410721) primarily using the Liu et al. Viruses (2019) metagenomic dataset
(NCBI SRA BioProject: PRJNA573298) (Fig 1, Supplementary Fig 1). In their paper, Xiao et al.
identified the PRJNA573298 dataset as a source of contigs from pangolin viral metagenomes that
mapped to the SARS-CoV-2 genome. Yet, Xiao et al. cite Liu et al. Viruses in their article as
follows: “SARSr-CoV sequences were previously detected in dead Malayan pangolins (reference
15: Liu et al. Viruses). These sequences appear to be from Pangolin-CoV identified in the present
study judged by their sequence similarity.” Given that Xiao et al. relied predominantly on the
dataset by Liu et al. Viruses to generate their genome sequence, it is curious that it was not clear
to Xiao et al. that they were studying the same pangolin CoV.

Xiao et al. renamed pangolin samples first published by Liu et al. Viruses without citing their study
as the original article that described these samples, and used the metagenomic data from these
samples in their analysis. To compound this issue, Xiao et al. used an inconsistent definition of
“total reads” in the description of the samples in their Extended Data Table 3, which made it
challenging to match the samples with those from Liu et al. Viruses. For samples M1 and M6,
Xiao et al. counted the number of sequenced fragments in the library, which corresponds to their
stated library size (Supplementary Table 1). For the remaining samples, Xiao et al. counted the
number of sequenced reads (two reads per fragment in paired-end Illumina libraries;
Supplementary Table 1 shows that the “total reads” for these samples are double the library
size). We were only able to match the pangolin samples from Liu et al. Viruses with those used
in Xiao et al.’s analysis after becoming aware of this inconsistency. Samples lung02, lung07,
lung08, and lung11 published by Liu et al. Viruses were re-named as M3, M2, M4, and M8,
respectively, in Xiao et al. Nature (Supplementary Table 1).
The sample lung08, first analyzed by Liu et al. Viruses, was a major source of metagenomic reads
spanning the entire pangolin CoV genome (Fig 1, Supplementary Fig 1). The only sample from
Xiao et al. that we could not match to those from the Liu et al. dataset, which contributed a
considerable number of reads was pangolin_9 (sample M1). However, the majority of the
pangolin_9/M1 reads map onto a single region in Orf1a (Fig 1A, Supplementary Fig 1). Indeed,
when the reads from samples lung08 and pangolin_9 are combined, the resulting read coverage
and alignment profile looks highly similar to the sample read profile in Xiao et al.’s Extended Data
Fig 4 (Supplementary Fig 1). Xiao et al. did not specify which of their seven samples with CoV
sequence reads was described by this figure.2 In addition, for the Spike RBD, the majority of the
metagenomic sequence data are derived from lung08 (even so, the read depth was low; Fig 1B).
During the review of this manuscript, on June 22, 2020, Xiao et al. added a new sample,
pangolin_10 to their Nature paper’s bioproject (NCBI SRA BioProject PRJNA607174).6 This new
sample was not described in the main text, figures, tables, or extended materials of the Nature
paper that was published on May 7, 2020. Specifically, Xiao et al. stated in their main text that
“Illumina RNAseq was used to identify viruses in the lung from nine pangolins.” All nine pangolins
are accounted for in their Extended Data Table 3, albeit four were renamed (and unattributed)
samples from the 2019 Liu et al. Viruses publication. Despite the addition of pangolin_10, it
remains unclear as to which sample produced the read profile shown in their Extended Data Fig
4. Based on the sample read profile, it is very likely that the first public description of pangolin_10

can instead be found in their recent Li et al. bioRxiv preprint, which was also released on June
22, 2020, but with no attribution of the sample to the Nature paper or the bioproject into which
they deposited the pangolin_10 data.7
To add to the challenge of evaluating the genome sequence accuracy, up until August, 2020, we
were unable to access the sequences from Liu et al. PLoS Pathogens and Xiao et al. Nature that
were used to fill the numerous gaps in their genomes. This prevents independent reconstruction
of these genomes. Briefly, each group first assembled their genome by pooling sequences across
multiple pangolin samples (Supplementary Table 1). Xiao et al. justified this approach by
explaining that there was only one ‘type’ of coronavirus among the pangolin samples.2 Yet, in
their study, Xiao et al. isolated particles of the pangolin CoV in Vero E6 culture, and verified the
virions by RT-PCR of the Spike and RdRp genes. We propose that it could have been more useful
to perform genome or amplicon sequencing on the isolated virus particles, instead of multiple
frozen pangolin samples, to fill the gaps in the genome sequence with greater confidence.
Similarly, Liu et al. PLoS Pathogens pooled sequences from three pangolins from the Guangdong
Provincial Wildlife Rescue Center: two of 21 pangolins confiscated in March, 2019 as described
in Liu et al. Viruses,4 and one of six pangolins confiscated in July, 2019.1 Liu et al. PLoS
Pathogens commented that the July sequences were less abundant than the March sequences,
and have not made these sequences available. We could not find a pangolin CoV genome dataset
with the accession 2312773 as was provided in the Liu et al. PLoS Pathogens Data Availability
statement (published on May 14, 2020). We have queried NCBI databases as well as the China
National GeneBank Database (https://db.cngb.org/). It is ultimately unclear which parts of the Liu
et al. pangolin CoV genome MP789 drew from the July pangolin. Nonetheless, due to their
reliance on the same dataset and samples, the Xiao et al. genome GD_1 (GISAID:
EPI_ISL_410721) and the Liu et al. genome MP789 (the version that was updated on May 18,
2020) share 99.95% nucleotide identity.
Based on our analysis, we emphasize that there has only been one confirmed source of pangolin
CoVs with a Spike RBD nearly identical to that of SARS-CoV-2: pangolins confiscated from
smugglers in Guangdong province in March, 2019 (Fig 2). The Guangdong pangolin CoV
analyses by Zhang et al. and Lam et al. also used the Liu et al. Viruses 2019 dataset, and this
was clearly stated in their publications.3,5 Lam et al. obtained additional March, 2019 smuggled
pangolin samples from the Guangzhou Customs Technology Center (NCBI SRA BioProject:
PRJNA606875), but only recovered CoV sequences from a single scale sample (Fig 1A) and

combined this with the Liu et al. Viruses dataset to generate their Guangdong pangolin CoV
reference.5 If there are batches of Guangdong pangolins other than the smuggled pangolins from
March, 2019 that have resulted in similar CoV sequences, particularly at the Spike RBD, we have
not been able to locate such data based on the Liu et al. and Xiao et al. publications. In
comparison to the Guangdong pangolin CoV, the Guangxi pangolin CoVs described by Lam et
al. are, once again, less similar to SARS-CoV-2 in the Spike RBD at both the amino acid and
nucleotide level even relative to the bat CoV RaTG13 (Fig 2). Of the five critical residues for
binding between the SARS-CoV Spike RBD and human ACE2 protein, the bat CoV RaTG13 and
the Guangxi pangolin CoVs each share only one residue with SARS-CoV-2, whereas the
Guangdong pangolin CoV shares five residues with SARS-CoV-2.5
We would like to reiterate the observations from the literature that it remains to be determined
whether the Guangdong and Guangxi pangolin CoVs are found in pangolins in the wild.1–3,5 All of
the CoV-positive pangolins were confiscated from smugglers, and the Guangdong pangolins were
described to have displayed severe respiratory illness and high mortality (14 of the 17 CoVpositive pangolins died within a 1.5 month interval).2,4,5 Xiao et al. did not detect CoVs in a second
batch of pangolins (four Malayan and four Chinese pangolins) from the Guangdong Provincial
Wildlife Rescue Center in August, 2019.2 Notably, we do not know how many other batches of
smuggled pangolins in China were tested by different groups, found to be CoV-negative, and not
published as negative results. In parallel, we do not know what other species of smuggled animals
have been tested for SARS-CoV-2. These could suggest a sampling bias that makes it difficult to
interpret whether smuggled pangolins are more likely to carry SARS-like CoVs as compared to
other species of smuggled animals. Furthermore, a longitudinal study of 334 pangolins
confiscated from smugglers in Malaysia, between 2009 to 2019, found that none of the pangolins
tested positive for coronavirus. The authors hypothesized that pangolins were an incidental host
of coronaviruses potentially due to exposure to infected humans and other smuggled animals.8 In
the scenario where only two batches of smuggled pangolins possess these SARS-like CoVs, the
CoVs could have come from other species held in captivity given the potentially broad host tropism
of the related SARS-CoV-2 spike9–12 and the fact that each of the two groups of smuggled
pangolins carried a single CoV strain. For instance, a Hong Kong smuggling bust in 2014
discovered 40 boxes of pangolin and masked palm civet meat13 (palm civets were an intermediate
host of SARS-CoV, 2002-2004). In February, 2019, ~30 tons of pangolin, including 61 live
pangolins, alongside bat carcasses were raided in Kota Kinabalu.14 Which other species were

found in the Guangdong and Guangxi anti-smuggling raids, and could these or the human
smugglers be hosts of similar CoVs?
One scientist, who read our preprint, inquired whether the above suggestion means that SARSlike CoVs, most closely related to the pangolin CoVs, were circulating among humans before the
outbreak of SARS-CoV-2. This is an important point that needs to be elaborated on, particularly
for readers who are not specialists in mechanisms of wildlife pathogen spillover into humans.
Following the original SARS epidemic in 2002-2004, 13-40% of the tested asymptomatic animal
handlers were positive for SARS-reactive antibodies; in comparison, the portion of the general
population carrying SARS-reactive antibodies was significantly lower (only up to 0.2% in
asymptomatic household contacts).15,16 This has been widely interpreted to mean that animal
handlers/traders (we include wildlife traffickers in this group) are frequently exposed to wild
animals and their pathogens on a regular or prolonged basis. Therefore, it is not surprising that
wildlife smugglers would be exposed to novel pathogens and serve as hosts of these pathogens
from time to time, without necessarily requiring or resulting in the widespread transmission of
these pathogens in the general human population.
In conclusion, our analysis points out that the two complete pangolin CoV genomes, GD_1 by
Xiao et al. Nature2 and MP789 by Liu et al. PLoS Pathogen1, were built primarily using the same
metagenomic dataset published by Liu et al. Viruses in 2019. Although there is only a single
source of pangolin CoVs that share a near identical Spike RBD with SARS-CoV-2, and there is
as yet no direct evidence of pangolins being an intermediate host of SARS-CoV-2, we would like
to reinforce that pangolins and other trafficked animals should continue to be considered as
carriers of infectious viruses with the potential to transmit into humans.1–3,5

Figure 1. Read profiles of the metagenomic data sets from Liu et al. 2019 Viruses, Xiao et
al. 2020 Nature, and Lam et al. 2020 Nature mapped to the Xiao et al. Guangdong
pangolin CoV genome sequence GD_1 (EPI_ISL_410721). Samples lung08 (described in Liu
et al. Viruses but re-introduced as M4 by Xiao et al. Nature) and pangolin_9 (sample M1, Xiao
et al. Nature) each had the most sequence data of all samples analyzed in Liu et al. Viruses and
Xiao et al. Nature, respectively. The “lung08 + pangolin_9” track shows their combined read
coverage. The “Liu et al. (2019)” track indicates the read coverage pooled from all of the
pangolin samples with mapped reads. The “Xiao et al. (2020)” track reveals the read coverage
pooled from all samples unique to Xiao et al. Nature with mapped reads (Supplementary Table
1). The “Liu (2019) + Xiao (2020)” track combines the read coverage from both studies and
appears highly similar to the metagenomic data reported in Xiao et al. Nature (Supplementary
Fig 1). The “P2S Lam et al. (2020)” track shows the read coverage from the scale sample that
was sequenced only by Lam et al. Nature (a single-end library). Read profiles are shown over
the entire genome (A) or the Spike receptor binding domain with the receptor binding motif
highlighted in blue (B). Regions with zero read coverage are highlighted in orange. Also shown
are the estimates of the mean depth of read coverage with or without duplicate reads (“all
mapped” or “deduplicated”).

Materials and Methods
Read processing and alignment
Raw reads were downloaded from the NCBI SRA (see Data Availability). We analyzed 21 and
seven paired-end libraries from Liu et al. Viruses and Xiao et al. Nature, respectively, as well as
one single-end library from Lam et al. Nature (the scale sample P2S). The reads were filtered
and cleaned using fastp version 0.20.0 on default settings (trimming adapter sequences,
removing poor-quality reads, etc.).17 The clean reads were mapped to the genome sequence of
GD_1 (GISAID: EPI_ISL_410721) using minimap2 version 2.17 on default settings.18 Duplicate
reads were marked and clean reads were coordinate-sorted using samtools version 1.10 (subcommands markdup and sort, respectively).19
Read coverage statistics
We computed the following read coverage statistics using bedtools version 2.29.220: (1)
percentage breadth of coverage with respect to GD_1; (2) mean depth of coverage with all
mapped reads; and (3) mean depth of coverage without duplicate reads. Also, the per-position
read depth data across the GD_1 genome were exported for plotting in R (R Core Team 2020).
Sequence analysis of the Spike gene
We compared the nucleotide and translated amino acid sequences of the receptor binding
domain (RBD) of the Spike gene of the pangolin coronaviruses from Lam et al. Nature, Liu et al.
Viruses, and Xiao et al. Nature with the sequences of the bat coronavirus RaTG13 and human
coronavirus Wuhan-Hu-1 (their GISAID accessions are provided in Supplementary Table 2).
We extracted the RBD sequences from GD_1 according to the genome coordinates 22,48323,151; the receptor binding motif (RBM) sequence embedded within the RBD is located at the
genome coordinates 22,837-23,052. The percentage sequence identities were calculated based
on pairwise alignments while excluding gapped sites and sites with ambiguous characters. The
pairwise sequence similarity matrix was plotted as a heatmap in R 21.
Read alignment visualization
The libraries lung08 (from Liu et al. Viruses) and pangolin_9 (from Xiao et al. Nature) contain
the highest number of reads mapped to GD_1 in their respective datasets (Supplementary
Table 1). We merged the read alignments from those two libraries together for visualization. For
the same purpose, we merged all the read alignments from the libraries of Liu et al. Viruses and
