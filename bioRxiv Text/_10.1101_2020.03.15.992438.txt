Abstract
MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are post-transcriptional regulators of gene expression that have been
found in more than 200 diverse organisms. Although it is still not fully established if RNA
viruses could generate miRNAs that would target their own genes or alter the host gene
expression, there are examples of miRNAs functioning as an antiviral defense mechanism. In the
case of Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), there are several
mechanisms that would make miRNAs impact the virus, like interfering with replication,
translation and even modulating the host expression. In this study, we performed a machine
learning based miRNA prediction analysis for the SARS-CoV-2 genome to identify miRNA-like
hairpins and searched for potential miRNA – based interactions between the viral miRNAs and
human genes and human miRNAs and viral genes. Our PANTHER gene function analysis results
indicate that viral derived miRNA candidates could target various human genes involved in
crucial cellular processes including transcription. For instance, a transcriptional regulator,
STAT1 and transcription machinery might be targeted by virus-derived miRNAs. In addition,
many known human miRNAs appear to be able to target viral genes. Considering the fact that
miRNA-based therapies have been successful before, comprehending mode of actions of
miRNAs and their possible roles during SARS-CoV-2 infections could create new opportunities
for the development and improvement of new therapeutics.

Introduction
Coronoviruses (CoVs) are pathogens with serious health effects including enteric, respiratory,
hepatic and central nervous diseases on human and animals. Zoonotic CoVs, Severe Acute
Respiratory Syndrome-Coronavirus (SARS-CoV) and Middle East Respiratory Syndrome
coronavirus (MERS-CoV), have been identified the sources of outbreaks in 2002/2003 and 2012,
respectively with high mortality rates due to severe respiratory syndrome

1,2.

Besides zoonotic

CoVs, there are four types of human CoVs have been identified known as HCoV-OC43, HCoV2293, HCoV-NL63 and HCoV-HKU1 1. Unknown pneumonia have been detected in Wuhan,
China and spread globally since December 2019. The World Health Organization (WHO) named
this new coronavirus as Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2)
responsible for the new disease termed Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) and it is the
seventh identified CoV with animal origin infecting human 2.
Coronaviruses are positive-single stranded RNA (+ssRNA) viruses with exceptionally large
genomes of ~ 30 kb with 5′cap structure and 3′polyA tail. The coronavirus subfamily is divided
into four genera: α, β, γ, and δ based on serotype and genome features 3. The genome of a typical
CoV codes for at least 6 different open reading frames (ORFs), which has variations based on the
CoV type 4. Some ORFs encode non-structural proteins while others code for structural proteins
required for viral replication and pathogenesis. Structural proteins include spike (S) glycoprotein,
matrix (M) protein, small envelope (E) protein, and nucleocapsid (N) protein with various roles
for virus enterance and spread. SARS-CoV-2 belongs to β CoV with 45-90% genetic similarity
to SARS-CoV based on sequence analysis and might share similar viral genomic and
transcriptomic complexity

3,5.

Currently, it has been also revealed that SARS-COV-2 has a very

high homology with bat CoVs, which indicated how it is transmitted to human without knowing
intermediate carriers 6. S protein of SARS-CoV-2 has a strong interaction with human
angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) expressed on alveolar epithelial cells which shows the
way of virus infection in human 7.
MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are small, noncoding RNAs that play role in regulation of the gene
expression in various organisms ranging from viruses to higher eukaryotes. It has been estimated
that miRNAs might influence around 60% of mammalian genes and their main effect is on
regulatory pathways including cancer, apoptosis, metabolism and development 8.

Although the current release of miRNAs, the standard miRNA depository, lists miRNAs of 271
organisms, only 34 of them are viruses 9. While, the first virus-encoded miRNAs was discovered
for the human Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) 10, more than 320 viral miRNA precursors were
reported so far. Although it has been shown that various DNA viruses express miRNAs, it is still
debatable if RNA viruses could also encode. The major concerns regarding miRNAs of RNA
viruses are based on 11:
-

the fact that RNA viruses that replicate in cytoplasm, do not have access to nuclear
miRNA machinery

-

since RNA is the genetic material, miRNA production would interfere with viral
replication

On the other hand, many features of miRNA - based gene regulation seems to be especially
beneficial for viruses. For instance, through targeting specific human genes by viral miRNAs, it
is possible to form an environment suitable for survival and replication of the virus. Furthermore,
for viral miRNAs it is likely to escape host defense system since host itself generates miRNAs in
the same manner.
Currently, options for the prevention and treatment of CoVs are very limited due to the
complexity. Therefore, detailed analysis of CoV-host interactions is quite important to
understand viral pathogenesis and to determine the outcomes of infection. Although there are
studies regarding to the viral replication and their interaction with host innate immune system,
the role of miRNA-mediated RNA-silencing in SARS-CoV-2 infection has not been enlightened
yet. In this study, SARS-CoV-2 genome was searched for miRNA-like sequences and potential
host-virus interactions based on miRNA actions were analyzed.

Methods
Data analysis, pre-miRNA prediction, mature miRNA detection workflows were generated by
using the Konstanz Information Miner (KNIME) platform 12

Data
Genome data of the virus was obtained from NCBI:
Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 isolate Wuhan-Hu-1, complete genome

GenBank: MN908947.3
MiRNA prediction workflow izMiR 13 and its related data were taken from Mendeley Data:
https://data.mendeley.com/datasets/mgh5r9wny7/1
Mature miRNA sequences of human were downloaded from miRBase Release 22.1 14.

Pre-miRNA prediction
Genome sequences of SARS-CoV-2 were transcribed (T->U) and divided into 500 nt long
fragments with 250 overlaps. Then these fragments were folded into their secondary structures
by using RNAfold 15 with default settings and hairpin structures were extracted, producing 950
hairpins in total.
A modified version of izMiR (SVM classifier is changed to Random Forest and latest miRBase
version was used for learning) was applied to these hairpins with ranging lengths (from 7 to 176)
(Figure 1). Based on the mean value of averages of 3 classifiers’ prediction scores (Decision
Tree, Naive Bayes and Random Forest), 29 hairpins passed 0.900 threshold and used for further
analysis.

Mature miRNA prediction and targeting
Selected hairpins were further processed into smaller sequences; maximum 23 nt length with 6 nt
overlaps. Then, these fragments were filtered based on minimum length of 15 and their location
on the hairpins (sequences not involving any loop nucleotides were included). Target search of
these remaining 30 candidate mature miRNAs were performed against human and SARS-CoV-2
genes by using psRNATarget tool with default settings 16. Moreover, human mature miRNAs’
from miRBase were applied for searching their targets in SARS-CoV-2 genes.

Gene Ontology
The targets of viral miRNAs in human genes were further analyzed for their Gene Ontology
(GO). To achieve this, PANTHER Classification System (http://www.pantherdb.org) was used
17.

Searching SARS-CoV-2 genome for sequences forming hairpin structures resulted in 950
hairpins with varying lengths (Supplementary Files). In order to use machine learning based
miRNA prediction approach of izMiR workflows, hundreds of features were calculated for all of
the pre-miRNA candidate sequences. Among those, minimum free energy (mfe) values required
for the folding of secondary structures of hairpin sequences and hairpin sequence lengths of
known human miRNAs from miRBase and predicted hairpins of SARS-CoV-2 were compared
(Figure 1). Based on the box-plots shown in Figure 1, most of the extracted viral hairpins seem
to be smaller than human miRNA precursors.

hairpins. Hairpin lengths shown in top graph. Minimum free energy scores obtained from
RNAfold 15 plotted in bottom panel.
Since viruses would need to use at least some members of host miRNA biogenesis pathway
elements, viral miRNAs should be similar to host miRNAs to a certain degree. Therefore, a
classification scheme trained with known human miRNAs was applied on SARS-CoV-2
hairpins. Only 29 hairpins out of 950 passed the 0.900 prediction score threshold and used for
further analysis. From these hairpins, 30 mature miRNA candidates were extracted and their
possible targets for human and SARS-CoV-2 genes were investigated.
SARS-CoV-2 miRNA candidates were further analyzed to test if they were similar to any of the
known mature miRNAs from 271 organism listed in miRBase. To achieve this, a basic similarity
search was performed based on the Levenshtein distance calculations in KNIME. However, there
was no significant similarity between hairpin or mature sequences.

While predicted mature miRNAs of SARS-CoV-2 were used to find their targets in SARS-CoV2 and human genes, mature miRNAs of human were also applied on SARS-CoV-2 genes (Table
1, Supplementary Files). Although miRNA based self-regulation of viral gene expression is a
hypothetical case, SARS-CoV-2 ORF1ab polyprotein gene might be the only one that could be a
target of viral miRNAs. In total 1367 human genes seem to be targeted by viral miRNAs. Table
1 lists some of the predicted targets of SARS-CoV-2 miRNAs in human genes that have roles in
transcription. The full list of miRNA – target predictions are available in Supplementary Files.

Considering the potential of miRNAs as biomarkers and therapeutic agents, it is essential to
check if any of the known human miRNAs could target viral genes. Among 2654 mature entries
of Homo sapiens in miRBase Release 22.1, 479 of them could target SARS-CoV-2 genes
(Supplementary Files). While Envelope and ORF6 genes were targeted by single miRNAs,
ORF1ab appeared to be the target of 369 different human mature miRNAs (Table 2). As
expected, number of targeting events appear to be correlated with the gene length.

Discussion
The potential roles of miRNA-mediated RNA interference in infection biology has been defined
as an essential regulatory molecular pathway. The involvement of miRNAs in host-pathogen
interactions during infection might include the targeting of viral genes by host-cellular miRNAs
as well as evolution of DNA and RNA virus-based gene silencing mechanisms to overcome host
antiviral response and to maintain viral infection and disease

29,30.

In addition, viruses might use

host cellular miRNAs for their own advantage. Therefore, molecular elucidation of the roles of
miRNAs in host-virus interaction might provide a deeper understanding for viral pathogenesis
and the development of an effective antiviral therapy as shown in several viruses including
Herpesvirus, Enterovirus and Hepatitis C

30–32.

Although the detailed knowledge about viral

miRNAs have been obtained from DNA viruses, it is still controversial for RNA viruses that
whether they produce their own miRNAs or not

33.

However, there are several reports showing

the presence of non-canonical (due to the lack of classical stem-loop structure in miRNAs), small
miRNA-like small RNAs produced during viral infections as shown in H5N1 Influenza 34, Ebola
virus

35

and HIV-1 36. Although they play crucial roles in several viral infections, miRNAs have

not been studied in the pathogenesis of SARS-CoV-2 infection. In this study, we elucidated
miRNA-mediated regulation responsible for SAR-CoV-2 infection by predicting possible host
genes targeted by viral miRNAs and viral genes targeted by cellular miRNAs, which might
provide potential ways to understand the underlying mechanisms of SARS-CoV-2 infection.
We investigated possible virulent genes of SARS-CoV-2 targeted by host-cellular miRNAs as
shown in Table 2, which are mainly responsible for viral biogenesis, entrance, replication and
infection. Except envelope (E) protein and ORF6, all viral genes (S, M, N, ORF1ab, ORF3a,
ORF8, ORF7a and ORF10) are targeted by multiple human miRNAs. For instance, hsa-miR203b-3p targeted ORF1ab and ORF3a with roles in viral replication was already shown to
suppress influenza A virus replication

37.

Even though hsa-miR-148a-3p targeted ORF8 to

prevent interspecies transmission and also replication, it was found to target S, E, M and ORF1a
protein in closely related SARS-CoV 38. hsa-let-7c-5p targeted ORF1ab in SARS-CoV-2 while it
was found to be involved in H1N1 influenza A suppression by targeting its M1 protein

39.

In

another study, ORF6 of SARS-CoV suppressed type I interferon signaling by blocking the

nuclear transport of STAT1 in the presence of interferon β 40, therefore, hsa-miR-190a-5p might
target ORF6 to overcome immune system escape in SARS-CoV-2. The presence of such
miRNAs could be considered as a host’s innate antiviral defense mechanism. On the other hand,
virus could use these miRNAs to suppress their own replication to escape from immune system
at the beginning of infection and transmission for a stronger infection. For instance, miR-146a5p was upregulated in hepatitis C virus-infected liver cells of patients and in infected human
hepatocytes, which promoted virus particle assembly 41. Moreover, ss RNA viruses could evolve
very rapidly to change their gene sequences matching with these host miRNAs, therefore, they
increase their host specificity. Once the virus establishes a successful transmission inside the
host, they would mutate their genes very rapidly to escape from host miRNAs, which results
from their RNA polymerases without proofreading activity 42,43.
Virus-derived miRNAs might function by targeting host and virus-encoded transcripts to
regulate host-pathogen interaction. The roles of viral miRNAs in pathogenesis include alteration
of host defense mechanisms and regulation of crucial biological processes including cell
survival, proliferation, modulation of viral life-cycle phase

Although encoding miRNAs

seems quite problematic for RNA viruses due to the nature of miRNA biogenesis pathway, it is
possible to circumvent these problems through different ways as seen in HIV-1 36. Therefore, we
analyzed possible human genes targeted by predicted miRNA like small RNAs (Table 1). Based
on the panther analysis, regulators of eukaryotic transcription would be the most important
targets of 18 SARS-CoV-2 derived mature miRNA like candidates out of 29 hairpins in total.
These transcriptional regulators are involved in both basal transcription machinery including
several components of human mediator complex (MED1, MED9, MED12L, MED19) and basal
transcription factors such as TAF4, TAF5 and TAF7L. Viruses might downregulate host gene
expression in order to increase their gene expression either co-transcriptionally in the nucleus or
post-transcriptionally in the nucleus or cytoplasm

45.

Therefore, targeting basal transcription

machinery such as components (TAFs) of TFIID complex by SARS-CoV-2 could prevent RNA
polymerase II to assemble on promoters of host genes at the initiation step. Viral factors have
been shown to block transcription initiation by inhibiting TFIID or more specifically TAF4 in
herpesvirus

46.

Another interesting target gene by SARS-CoV-2 miRNA was different subunits

of CCR4-NOT transcription complex including CNOT4, CNOT10 and CNOT6L, which are
deadenylases involved in mRNA decay

47.

Therefore, suppression of these genes by viral

miRNAs could impede mRNA turnover in the host and provide opportunities for viral mRNA to
escape from degradation. Additionally, site specific trans-acting factors such as MAFG, STAT1,
STAT5B and SOX11 would be targeted by viral miRNAs. STAT family transcription factors are
activated by cytokine-induced stimuli and generally involved in an interferon response. In
Kaposi’s sarcoma-associated herpesvirus (KSHV), viral miRNAs were found to inhibit STAT3
and STAT5, resulting in deregulated interferon response and transition into lytic viral replication
48.

As a conclusion, viral diseases have been paid attention as a global health problem due to the
lack of proper treatment strategies and rapid evolution of viruses. In recent years, studies have
focused on identifying miRNAs as targets for the treatment of viral diseases and there are
promising clinical phase studies evaluating the therapeutic potential of antagomirs targeting host
miRNAs such as miR-122 in hepatitis C

49.

Based on the results shown in Table 2, it can be

concluded that increases in the level of host miRNAs targeting virulent genes such as S, M, N, E
and ORF1ab would block viral entry and replication. Moreover, decreasing the levels of host
miRNAs would make SARS-CoV-2 more replicative and visible for the host immune system.
However, alterations in host miRNA levels would interfere with specific cellular processes
which are crucial for the host biology. In our study, we have also identified possible miRNA like
small RNAs from SARS-CoV-2 genome which target important human genes. Therefore,
antagomirs targeting viral miRNAs could be also designed even though there are only a few
studies for DNA viruses

45.

However, all these therapeutic possibilities need further

mechanistical evaluations to understand how they regulate virus-host interaction. Therefore,
further in vitro, ex vivo and in vivo studies will be required to validate candidate miRNAs for
SARS-CoV-2 infection.
