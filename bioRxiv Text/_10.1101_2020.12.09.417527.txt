Type III interferons exhibit antiviral activity against influenza
viruses, coronaviruses, rotaviruses, and others. In addition, this
type of interferon theoretically has therapeutic advantages, in comparison with type I interferons, due to its ability to activate a narrower group of genes in a relatively small group of target cells.
Hence, it can elicit more targeted antiviral or immunomodulatory
responses. Obtaining biologically-active interferon lambda (hIFNλ1) is fraught with difficulties at the stage of expression in soluble
form or, in the case of expression in the form of inclusion bodies, at
the stage of refolding. In this work, hIFN-λ1 was expressed in the
form of inclusion bodies, and a simple, effective refolding method
was developed. Efficient and scalable methods for chromatographic
purification of recombinant hIFN-λ1 were also developed. Highyield, high-purity product was obtained through optimization of
several processes including: recombinant protein expression; metal
affinity chromatography; cation exchange chromatography; and an
intermediate protein refolding stage. The obtained protein was
shown to have expected, specific biological activity in line with
published effects: induction of MxA gene expression in A549 cells.

1. INTRODUCTION
Interferons play a critical role in the immune
response by suppressing viral spread in the early
stages of infection and form the first line of
defense against viral infection in mammals [1,2].
According to amino acid sequence and type of
receptor through which signal transmission is
mediated, interferons are divided into three
groups: types I, II, and III [1,3]. Type III
interferons (lambda interferons, IFN-λ) are related
to type I interferons (interferon-α and interferonβ) and demonstrate a similar antiviral effect [4,5].
Type III interferons are promising therapeutic
agents that can induce a more targeted antiviral or
immunomodulatory
response
than
other
interferon types [6,7]. Such interferons primarily
affect viruses that target cells of the respiratory
tract, gastrointestinal tract, or liver [8]. Thus, type
III interferons exhibit antiviral activity against a
number of respiratory and gastrointestinal viruses:

influenza virus; metapneumovirus; respiratory
syncytial virus; coronavirus; and rotavirus [6].
Availability of a simple, effective method for
producing type III interferons is a necessary
prerequisite for further research of its potential as
an antiviral or immunomodulatory agent. In
previously published work, methods for
production of recombinant hIFN-λ1 in soluble
form with the proteolytically cleaved S-tag [9],
and in the form of inclusion bodies with 6His-tag
[5,10], have been proposed. In this work, we
cloned and expressed recombinant human
interferon-λ1 (hIFN-λ1). Along with the 6His-tag,
inclusion body approach, we propose: a simple and
effective refolding method; and an efficient,
potentially-scalable chromatographic purification
method. The hIFN-λ1 produced features specific
activity suitable for research and, potentially,
future diagnostic or therapeutic application.

2. MATERIAL AND METHODS
2.1. Materials
Reagents obtained from Sigma included: tris
base; Na2HPO4; NaCl; EDTA; PMSF; Tween 20;
glycerol; acetonitrile; TFA; trehalose; L-arginine;
sodium acetate; acetic acid; HCl; and urea. HisTrap
FF Crude and Source 15S 4.6/100 columns were
obtained from GE Healthcare; BioScale Mini P6
cartridges and TGX anyKD precast SDS-PAGE gels
were obtained from Bio-Rad. For endotoxin evaluation, the LAL Chromogenic Endpoint Assay
(#HIT302, Hycult Biotech) was used. For enzymatic hydrolyses, trypsin and chymotrypsin
(Promega) were used. Matrices for MALDI-TOF
mass spectrometry (HCCA) were manufactured by
Bruker.
Lambda interferon levels were evaluated by human IL-29/IL-28B (IFN-lambda 1/3) DuoSet
ELISA (DY1598B, R&D Systems, USA). Biological
activity experiments were performed using: the
A549 cell line (ATCC, CCL-185); F12K media, fetal bovine serum, and DPBS manufactured by
Gibco (USA); and 12-well plates from Thermo Scientific Nunc (USA). Total RNA isolation and realtime PCR were performed using: TRIZol reagent
(Invitrogen, USA); M-MLV reverse transcriptase,
MMLV Reaction Buffer, and ultrapure water
(Promega, USA); BioMaster HS-qPCR (BioLabMix, Russia); and oligo(dT)16 primers (DNA-Synthesis, Russia).

(0.5% yeast extract, 1% Bacto tryptone, 1% NaCl)
containing ampicillin. The overnight cultures
were then used to inoculate fresh LB medium containing ampicillin (OD600 = 0.1 at start of new incubation). Bacterial cultures were cultivated with
agitation (orbital shaker) to an OD600 value of 0.7.
To optimize cultivation conditions, protein expression was induced by various IPTG concentrations (0.01, 0.05, 0.1 mM), and cultures were incubated further (orbital shaker, 32℃ or 37℃, 3
hours). Cultures were sonicated (MSE ultrasonic
disintegrator) on ice (10 pulses, of 10 seconds each,
in 30-second intervals), followed by centrifugation for 1 hour (20,000 g at +4℃). Supernatants and
pellets were collected separately. Levels of hIFNλ1 expression, and its presence in supernatants or
pellets (inclusion bodies), were determined by
polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE).
2.4. Protein purification and refolding
Chromatographic purification was performed
on a GE Healthcare AKTA pure 25M system. Primary purification of hIFN-λ1 was performed by
immobilized metal affinity chromatography
(IMAC) under denaturing conditions. Cells were
precipitated by centrifugation for 10 min at 4,500
g (+4°C). Next, cell pellets (1 g wet weight) were
resuspended in 30 ml of denaturing buffer (20 mM
sodium phosphate, 300 mM sodium chloride, 8 M
urea, 20 mM imidazole, pH 7.8, 1 mM PMSF); suspensions were sonicated (MSE ultrasonic disintegrator) using 10 pulses (30 seconds each, at 2 minute intervals) on ice. Lysate was clarified by centrifugation for 20 minutes at 13,000 g (+10°C).
A 1 mL HisTrap FF Crude column was equilibrated with 5 ml of binding buffer (30 mM sodium
phosphate, 300 mM sodium chloride, 8 M urea, 20
mM imidazole, pH 7.8) at a flow rate 0.5 ml/min.
Clarified lysate was loaded onto the column (at a
flow rate of 0.2 ml/min), followed by washing
with 20 ml of binding buffer. The target protein
was eluted with 5 ml of elution buffer (30 mM sodium phosphate, 300 mM sodium chloride, 8 M
urea, 500 mM imidazole, pH 7.8) at a flow rate of
0.2 ml/min. Eluate was monitored by optical density (280 nm wavelength), and fractions of the target protein with an OD280 greater than 300 mAU

2.2. Plasmid construction
In
silico
optimized
sequence
(https://www.genscript.com/tools/gensmart-codon-optimization), encoding hIFN-λ1 #Q8IU54
[11], was synthesized by Evrogen and cloned into
the pet302-NT-His plasmid. That vector contains
a sequence encoding a polyhistidine tag at the Nterminus of synthesized protein. The resultant
construct (pet302-NT-His-hIFN-λ1) was checked
for errors by sequencing.
2.3. Protein expression
Escherichia coli cultures (BL-21 DE3) were
transformed with pet302-NT-His-hIFN-λ1 and
seeded on Luria Bertani (LB) agar plates containing ampicillin (100 μg/ml). Individual colonies
were picked and grown overnight in LB media

were collected. EDTA (0.5 M) was added to target
protein fractions to a final concentration of 5 mM.
Protein concentration was determined by chromatogram integration using Unicorn 6 software,
assuming: the absorbance of a 0.1% hIFN-λ1 solution at 280 nm to be 0.85 per cm of optical path
(calculated based on primary protein sequence using the ProtParam service).
Protein refolding was performed by the dilution method. Chilled refolding solution was placed
on a magnetic stirrer, and a solution of denatured
protein (2 mg/ml) was added dropwise to a final
concentration of 0.1 mg/ml. The resulting solution
was stirred for 10 minutes and then incubated for
24 hours at +4°C. The resulting refolded protein solution was filtered through a PES syringe filter
(0.45 μm pore size).
Final purification was performed by cation exchange chromatography. A SOURCE™ 15S
4.6/100 column was equilibrated with 8 ml of start
buffer (20 mM Tris hydrochloride, 2 mM EDTA,
pH 7.5) at a flow rate of 2 ml/min. Next, refolded
and filtered protein solution was loaded onto the
column, followed by column washing with 10 ml
of start buffer (2 ml/min). Target protein was
eluted with a linear salt gradient (0 to 1 M NaCl)
in start buffer at a flow rate of 2 ml/min for 15
minutes. Eluate was monitored by optical density
at 280 nm; fractions (0.5 ml) featuring OD280 values
above 25 mAU were collected. Fractions were analyzed by polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis.
Fractions containing target protein with minimal
impurities were combined. The Bio-Scale Mini P6
Desalting Cartridge (Bio-Rad) was used to transfer
into phosphate buffered saline (pH 7.2). Protein
concentration was determined by the Lowry
method.

scribed [13]. Gels were visualized using the ChemiDoc MP gel documentation system and analyzed
using Bio-Rad Image Lab Software.

2.5.2 Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay

ELISA was carried out using commercial reagents. Levels of hIFN-λ1 were evaluated by human
IL-29/IL-28B (IFN-lambda 1/3) DuoSet ELISA
(DY1598B, R&D Systems, USA), according to
manufacturer’s instructions. A different commercial kit, Mouse IL-28 A/B (IFN-lambda 2/3) DuoSet ELISA (DY1789B, R&D Systems), was used to
assess cross-reactivity.

2.5.3 MALDI-TOF

The amino acid sequence of recombinant
6xHis-hINF-λ1 protein was confirmed using
MALDI-TOF mass spectrometry. Following
PAGE, fragments were excised from gel and
washed twice for dye removal (30 mM NH4HCO3
in 40% acetonitrile). Gel fragments were next dehydrated with 100% acetonitrile, dried in air, and
subjected to enzymatic digestion by trypsin or
chymotrypsin. Trypsin (20 ug/ml in 50 mM
NH4HCO3) was added to gel, and incubation was
performed for 2 hours at 60℃. Incubations with
chymotrypsin (20 ug/ml in 100 mM Tris-HCl, 1
mM CaCl2, pH 8.0) were performed for 18 hours at
25℃. In both cases, reactions were stopped with
1% TFA in 10% acetonitrile. Peptides after enzymatic digestion were mixed with HCCA matrix,
put onto the metal target, and their mass spectra
recorded in positive ion registration reflective
mode using the UltrafleXtreme MALDI-TOF mass
spectrometer (Bruker). Spectra were processed in
flexAnalysis software (Bruker). Protein identification was performed in BioTools (Bruker) using
MASCOT (http://www.matrixscience.com/). It
should be noted that: recombinant protein amino
acid sequence (Fig. 1b) was added to the local database; during the identification process, the two
databases (local and SwissProt, https://www.uniprot.org/) were used simultaneously. Mass tolerance was established as 20 ppm; oxidation of methionine was indicated as a variable modification.
Identification was considered reliable based on
spectrum score and threshold (p < 0.05).

2.5. Product analysis

2.5.1 SDS-PAGE

Purified protein was analyzed by SDS-PAGE
using the Laemmli method under reducing conditions [12]. Electrophoresis materials used (BioRad) included: 'Any kD TGX' precast gels; Kaleidoscope Plus Protein Ladder; PowerPac Basic DC
power source; and Mini Protean Tetra cell. Gels
were stained with a Coomassie solution as de-3-

USA).

2.6. Biological activity
Type I and type III interferons induce the expression of ISGs (interferon stimulated genes)
through their heterodimeric receptors. One of the
key antiviral ISGs is MxA [3]. Unlike most ISGs,
the Mx genes are not characterized by constitutive
expression; their expression is specifically caused
by the action of type I and III IFNs. This makes
MxA an excellent marker of activation of an IFNdependent response [14]. Thus, biologically active
hIFN-λ1 should induce MxA expression. To determine changes in MxA mRNA level, real-time
qPCR analysis was performed following sample
preparation (RNA isolation, reverse transcription)

2.6.3. Reverse transcription reaction

Following RNA extraction, samples were reverse transcribed using M-MLV reverse transcriptase (M-MLV RT) as described [15]. A mixture of
2 μg total RNA and 1 μg oligo(dT)16 primers, adjusted with ultrapure water to a final volume of 12
μl, was incubated at 70℃ for 5 min. Tubes were
immediately cooled on ice, and a mix was then
added containing: 5 μl 5x MMLV Reaction Buffer;
1.5 μl 5 mM dNTPs; 1 μl M-MLV RT; and 5.5 μl
ultrapure water. Complementary DNA synthesis
was carried out at 42℃ for 60 min. Enzyme (MMLV RT) was inactivated by heating (65℃, 5 min).
Products were stored at −20℃.

2.6.1 Cell treatment

2.6.4. Real-time qPCR

А549 (carcinomatous alveolar basal epithelial
cell line) cells were used. Cells were cultured using: F12K media with 1% GlutaMax and 10% fetal
bovine serum; and 12-well plates (5×105
cells/well). Monolayers were washed with DPBS
and treated with 10 ng/ml hIFN-λ1. After 10 h or
24 h of incubation (37°C, 5% CO2, humidification),
hIFN-λ1 was removed. Cell monolayers were
washed again with DPBS. The treated cell cultures
and non-treated controls were harvested.

Real-time qPCR assays were performed using
the CFX96 Real-Time PCR System (Bio-Rad). Reaction mixtures contained: 12.5 μl of 2x BioMaster
HS-qPCR; 0.5 μl (0.6 μM) of each primer and
probe; 2 μl of first-strand cDNA; and 9 μl of ultrapure water. Amplification was performed using
the following conditions: an activation step (95℃,
5 min); and 40 cycles of amplification (95℃ for 15
sec; 60℃ for 60 sec). Fluorescence detection was
performed in each cycle at the 60℃ step. The comparative cycle threshold method (ΔΔCT) was used
to quantitate MxA expression. Results were normalized to GAPDH endogenous reference expression levels. At least three biological replicates were
used for each data point. Statistical analyses were
performed using GraphPad Prism 6.0.

2.6.2 RNA isolation

Total RNA was isolated from A549 cells using
TRIZol reagent according to manufacturer’s instructions. RNA concentration and general integrity were measured using a NanoDrop ND-1000
spectrophotometer (NanoDrop Technologies,

An

sequence encoding hIFN-λ1 was synthesized and
cloned into pet302 NT-His plasmid by Evrogen.
The resultant plasmid was verified by sequencing
and found to contain no errors. The pet302 NTHis vector contains sequence encoding a 6 histidine tag at the N-terminus of recombinant protein.
The resultant recombinant protein amino acid sequence, encoded by the construct (plasmid pet302
+ hIFN-λ1), is shown in Figure 1b.

3.2. Protein expression
Upon IPTG induction, a BL-21 DE3 cell culture
transformed with the pet302-NT-His-hIFN-λ1
plasmid showed expression of a protein with a molecular weight of about 21 kDa. The theoretical
molecular weight of the protein was 21.3 kDa. In
the experiment, the concentration of inducer and
the incubation temperature were varied. The incubation time with the inducer was 3 hours. Each
sample was fractionated (Figure 2a).
Under the conditions tested, the target protein
was expressed in the form of inclusion bodies. According to the literature [5,10,16], this is a

common occurrence with production of recombinant interferons in E. Coli. It should be noted that
the hIFN-λ1 gene was also cloned into the
pet22b+vector, at the MscI and XhoI sites, in order
to create a fusion protein not only with a histidine
tag at the C-terminus, but also with pelB sequence
at the N-terminus. The pelB sequence encodes a
signal peptide, potentially contributing to
periplasmic protein localization. However, even in
the presence of the signal peptide, recombinant

protein was localized in inclusion bodies (data not
shown).
Since cultivation conditions and the presence of
pelB sequence did not increase the amount of soluble protein, production of hIFN-λ1 was carried
out using: pet302 NT-His plasmid; LB medium
with ampicillin (100 μg/ml); 37℃ incubation; and
platform agitation (250 rpm). When conditions
were met (culture OD600 = 0.7 arbitrary units),

and cultivation with induction was continued for
3 more hours (Fig. 2b).

20,000 g. Supernatants were collected and dialyzed against phosphate buffered saline for 24
hours, followed by filtration through a PES syringe filter (0.2 μm pore size). Protein concentrations were determined by the Lowry method. For
estimation of relative 'soluble protein yield' of refolding variations, 100 μg/ml was designated as
100%. The results of the experiment are shown in
Table 1.

3.3. Protein purification and refolding
Primary protein purification was carried out by
metal affinity chromatography under denaturing
conditions. This purification method, with on-column refolding of hIFN-λ1 described earlier [10],
showed low yield of refolded protein (less then 5
mg of correctly-folded protein per liter of culture).
Therefore, it was decided to perform the first purification step under denaturing conditions, followed by refolding of the partially purified protein. Ni-Sepharose 6FF resin (prepacked HisTrap
FF Crude columns) was chosen because of its high
dynamic binding capacity (about 35 mg of hIFNλ1 per 1 ml of sorbent) and the possibility of further scale-up. The chromatogram of the first purification step is shown in Figure 3a.
Two refolding buffers with different pH (trisHCl, pH 7.5; sodium acetate, pH 5.5), with and
without refolding additives, were selected for
screening. Denatured recombinant protein samples (at a concentration of 2 mg/ml) were added to
pre-cooled refolding buffer (to final concentration
of 100 μg/ml) and mixed by pipetting, followed by
incubation for 24 hours at +4℃. Precipitated protein was removed by centrifugation for 1 hour at

The highest yields of recombinant hIFN-λ1 in
soluble form were seen with two specific refolding
buffers: Buffer C (80%); and Buffer E (89%). The
proposed refolding method provides a significantly higher yield, takes less time, and is more
economical in comparison with the stepwise dialysis method proposed [5] for IFN-λ3, another type
III interferon. Conductivity of the protein solution
after refolding was about 5 mS/cm; therefore, it
does not interfere with subsequent ion-exchange
chromatography. There is thus no need for dialysis
or diafiltration of the refolded protein solution. It
is possible to proceed directly to the final purification step.
The isoelectric point of the hIFN-λ1 recombinant protein was 9.08 according to the ProtParam
Tool [17]. Thus, hIFN-λ1 in refolding solution is
positively charged, so cation exchange chromatography was chosen as a final purification step. With
comparison of different cation exchange resins,
the best results (maximum protein yield, minimal
impurities) were noted (data not shown) with resins featuring particle size of 15 μm or less, such as
Source 15S (GE Healthcare) and ENrich S (BioRad). Source 15S was selected because of higher
flow rates and availability for purchase in bulk (for
potential process scale-up later). The chromatogram of the final protein purification step is shown
in Figure 3b. The target protein eluted in the conductivity range from 45 to 65 mS/cm. It should be
noted that hIFN-λ1 elutes as a double peak, which
may indicate the presence of two different conformational variants.
The method makes it possible to obtain up to 70
mg of recombinant hIFN-λ1 from 1 L of cell culture
(~5.2 g wet weight). Expression in the form of inclusion bodies protects the protein from proteolysis during cultivation. Simple and effective refolding provides a high yield of native-form protein
with proven biological activity.

Confirmation of recombinant protein amino
acid sequence was carried out using MALDI-TOF
mass spectrometry after enzymatic hydrolysis of
'protein in gel' with trypsin. In the area marked
with an arrow (Fig. 4), the 6xHis-hIFN-λ1 recombinant
protein
was
reliably
identified
(Score/threshold was 156/76, sequence coverage
70%). Additional hydrolysis with chymotrypsin
extends the sequence coverage to 85%. Protein sequences found in mass spectra are highlighted in
Figure 1b. Thus, the obtained protein was reliably
identified as human interferon lambda-1 (6xHishIFN-λ1).

3.4.3. ELISA

Binding of the recombinant protein with antihIFNλ1 monoclonal antibodies was shown by
sandwich ELISA. The commercial 'Human IL29/IL-28B (IFN-lambda 1/3) DuoSet ELISA' kit
(DY1598B, R&D Systems) was used (Fig. 5).
For each concentration, the average optical absorbance (OD450-OD655) is indicated in relative
units. Concentrations of hIFN-λ1 were determined
by the Lowry method. These results show that a
constant +4°C temperature is the preferred storage

been shown that lipopolysaccharides do not induce the production of either IFN-α/β or IFN-λ in
respiratory epithelial cells [14,20]. The A549 cells
used here are also a respiratory epithelial line, and
lipopolysaccharide-induced MxA expression is not

ng/ml) compared to control cells (Fig. 6). The level
of MxA expression increased by more than 20fold. Since MxA is an interferon-stimulated gene,
increased expression can be considered reliable
evidence of the biological activity of the obtained
hIFN-λ1 [14].

condition for recombinant hIFN-λ1 protein, not 80℃ followed by thawing. Increasing the stability
of the protein product is a priority goal for further
improvement of this method. Ideally, this would
minimize changes associated with one or more
'freeze-thaw' cycles.
3.5. Confirmation of biological activity

3.5.1 Limulus amebocyte lysate testing

In order to exclude the possibility of stimulation of A549 cells by bacterial lipopolysaccharides,
the endotoxin level was determined by LAL test.
The results show that recombinant hIFN-λ1 solution contains endotoxin at a concentration of
about 25 EU/ml, which corresponds to no more
than 5 ng/ml of endotoxin [18]. The concentration
of the analyzed sample was 620 μg/ml. Consequently, there was less than 0.05 EU endotoxin per
μg of protein, which is in line with commercial analogues on the market [19]. Thus, endotoxins present in the solution should not significantly affect

CONCLUSION
In this work, we developed an efficient and potentially-scalable method for refolding and purification of recombinant human hIFN-λ1. The purified protein was confirmed to feature the expected
biological activity. The developed method pro-

vides a high yield of protein with low impurity
content, such as lipopolysaccharide. It is therefore
potentially suitable for isolation of type III interferons not only for research and diagnostic applications, but also for therapeutic use.
