Abstract:
Influenza viruses, corona viruses and related pneumotropic viruses cause sickness and
death partly by inducing a hyper-proinflammatory response by immune cells and cytokines in
the host airway. Here we show that the cardiac glycoside digitoxin suppresses this response
induced by influenza virus strain A/Wuhan/H3N2/359/95 in the cotton rat lung. The cytokines
TNFa, GRO/KC, MIP2, MCP1, TGFb, and IFNg. are significantly and differentially reduced.
Since the hyper-proinflammatory expression of cytokines is a host response, we suggest that
digitoxin may have therapeutic potential for not only influenza and but also for coronavirus
infections.

Introduction:
Influenza viruses, corona viruses and related pneumotropic viruses cause sickness and
death partly by inducing a hyper-proinflammatory immune response in the host airway. This
immune overreaction, called a cytokine storm, can lead to multiorgan failure and death (Tisoncik
et al., 2012). For example, Influenza A (H5N1) has been shown to activate the TNFa-driven
NFkB signaling pathway in a mouse host during viral infection generating a cytokine storm
(Schmolke et al., 2009). As anticipated, inhibitors of NFkB acutely suppress cytokine storm and
increase survival in a mouse model of SARS CoV infection (DeDiego et al., 2014). Recent data
show that COVID-19 also activates NFkB (Guo et al., 2020). Cytokine storm marks the airways
of SARS-CoV-2-infected patients that were admitted to the Intensive Care Unit (ICU) with more
severe disease (Huang et al., 2020). Since there are multiple strains of influenza as well as
coronavirus, there might be an advantage to develop therapies that suppress host-induced
cytokine storm, in addition to developing strain-specific vaccines.

The clinical problem is that there are limited options for treating respiratory cytokine
storm, most of which are predicated on inhibiting NFkB-activated cytokine expression (Yang et
al., 2013a; Teijaro et al., 2014; Yang et al., 2017). The absence of NFkB inhibitory drugs from
the human formulary is due to most candidate drugs being either neurotoxic or nephrotoxic
when administered chronically (Zhang et al., 2017). One drug that lacks these toxicities is the
cardiac glycoside digitoxin. We have previously shown digitoxin to be among the most potent
inhibitors of the proinflammatory TNFa/NFkB pathway in the human airway and in other
epithelial cells, both in vitro (Srivastava et al., 2004), and in vivo (Zeitlin et al., 2017; Pollard et
al., 2019; Yang et al., 2019). Corroborating this is a screen of 2800 drugs and bioactive
compounds which found digitoxin to be the 2nd most potent inhibitor of TNFa/NFkB activity
(Miller et al., 2011). Digitoxin has been a drug to treat heart failure for decades, and is safe for
children and adults with normal hearts (Hoffman and Bigger, 1990). In a clinical trial of digitoxin
administered to young adults with the proinflammatory lung disease cystic fibrosis, digitoxin was
safe. The study showed "the mRNAs encoding chemokine/cytokine or cell surface receptors in
immune cells were decreased in nasal epithelial cells...leading to pathway-mediated reductions
in IL-8, IL-6, lung epithelial inflammation, neutrophil recruitment and mucus hypersecretion."
(Zeitlin et al., 2017).

To further test the ability of digitoxin to inhibit cytokine storm related pneumotropic viruses, we
used the cotton rat model of influenza infection to investigate the effects of digitoxin in influenzainduced cytokine storm. The cotton rat model has the important advantage of susceptibility to
influenza infection without engineered adaptation. In addition, it has been shown that the
response of the cotton rat to this virus strain evokes a pattern of pulmonary cytokine changes
that parallel the human response (Ottolini et al., 2005).
Results:

Digitoxin blocks cytokine storm
Figure 1 shows the changes in cytokine protein in the lung due to digitoxin
administration in the cotton rat after intranasally infected with 107TCID50/100 gm of animal of
influenza strain A/Wuhan/H3N2/359/95 virus. Animals were given three different doses of
digitoxin, starting one day prior to virus administration and continuing with a daily dose until
sacrifice on day 7. The maximum dose of digitoxin, 30 µg/kg, was calculated to be similar to the
human dose routinely used to treat heart failure. As shown in Figure 1, protein data were
collected for IFNg (Interferon gamma); GRO/KC (rodent equivalent of human IL8); MIP2
(Chemokine (C-X-C motif) ligand 2, CXCL2, Macrophage inflammatory protein 2-alpha);
TNFa (Tumor Necrosis Factor alpha); IL-1b (Interleukin one beta); MCP1 (Monocyte
chemoattractant Protein 1, CCL2); and TGFb (Transforming Growth Factor beta). As
summarized in Table 1, digitoxin-dependent changes in protein were found to be significant for
6 of the 7 cytokines. The digitoxin-dependent reductions are specific and saturating for each
cytokine, but do not reduce any of them to zero.

Digitoxin differentially affects cytokine expression
Table 1 shows that the greatest significant digitoxin-dependent reductions in cytokine
proteins were found for IFNg (68.9%), GRO/KC (46.6%), and MCP1 (54.9%). Smaller but still
significant reductions in cytokine proteins were found for MIP2 (32.2%) and TNFa (38.4%). As
also shown in Table 1, a significant reduction of only 15.3% was found for TGFb cytokine
protein at a concentration of 3 µg/kg, while only trending significance was noted at higher

digitoxin concentrations. In the case of IL-1b only the highest digitoxin concentration trended
towards significance. Thus digitoxin independently, dose-dependently and significantly lowers
the individual concentrations in the lung of at least these six cytokines which have been induced
by viral exposure.
Discussion:
These data show that administration of digitoxin to the cotton rat inhibits expression of
many cytokines in the lung that are induced by influenza strain A/Wuhan/H3N2/359/95,
including TNFa, the key activator of the TNFa/NFkB inflammation pathway. Digitoxin inhibits
cytokine storm without compromising the entire immune system from physiologically responding
to viral infection. The data also indicate that digitoxin acts on multiple cell types. For example,
IFNg is secreted only from activated T lymphocytes and NK cells of the immune system (Mah
and Cooper, 2016). The remainder of the cytokines are secreted by epithelial cells in the airway,
as well as by endothelial cells, immune cells and others (Mills et al., 1999; Liu et al., 2017).
GRO/KC (CXCL1, the rodent equivalent of human IL8), a key target of NFkB signaling, is the
most powerful known chemoattractant for drawing neutrophils into the lung. MIP2 and MCP1
induce entry and accumulation of monocytes and macrophages into the lung, and are targets of
NFkB. TGFb drives, and is driven by, NFkB-signaling for inflammation and fibrosis. IL-1b also
drives NFkB, and is driven by NFkB. It appears that digitoxin-dependent reduction in
TNFa/NFkB signaling is sufficient to suppress influenza A-driven cytokine storm.
In the cotton rat lung, IFNg mRNA expression in response to infection is biphasic (Ottolini
et al., 2005). There is an early phase, from 6 hours after infection on day 1 to day 6, which may
reflect the presence of activated NK cells. The late phase, from day 6 to day 28, may be the
product of incoming antigen-specific T cells. Importantly, simply neutralizing INFg in a mouse
model of infection with influenza A virus strain A/California/07/2009 (H1N1v; "Swine Flu") is
sufficient to not only alleviate acute lung injury but also to increase weight and survival rate (Liu
et al., 2019). Reduced IFNg is associated with reduced TNFa and NFkB activation. The data
also show that digitoxin treatment causes the most profound reduction in INFg expression. It is
further known that IFNg expression is driven by a combination of both NFkB and NFAT (Sica et
al., 1997). As summarized in Figure 2, digitoxin not only reduces NFkB expression, but also
reduces NFAT through digitoxin-dependent activation of Caspase 3 (Yang et al., 2013b).

Finally, since antiviral properties have been reported for digitoxin and other cardiac
glycosides, it is a limitation of the study that we cannot exclude other antiviral effects by digitoxin
from contributing to the reduction in influenza-dependent cytokine concentrations (Burkard et
al., 2015; Amarelle and Lecuona, 2018; Wei et al., 2020).
In conclusion, these data show that digitoxin blocks the host cytokine storm induced by
influenza strain A/Wuhan/H3N2/359/95 in the cotton rat lung. Since digitoxin already had been
shown to be safe in CF patients with pulmonary disease and a normal heart, and caused a
similar reduction in NF-KB driven cytokine expression, this drug may be a good candidate for
further investigation as a therapy for influenza and potentially for COVID-19.
Methods:
Animal protocol
Cotton rat experiments were performed as previously described (Ottolini et al., 2005).
All experiments were performed using protocols that followed federal guidelines and were
approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee. Animals were sacrificed by
carbon dioxide inhalation.
Drugs and protocol for drug preparation
Digitoxin (µg/kg) was obtained from Sigma-Aldrich (> 95% pure). The drug was prepared
as a stock solution in 95% ethanol, and further diluted in PBS before administration. Digitoxin
was administered to cotton rats intraperitoneally one day before intranasal infection with
107TCID50/100 gm cotton rat with influenza strain A/Wuhan/H3N2/359/95. Daily digitoxin
treatment continued until harvest on day 7 of the experiment.
Tissue preparation and histological analysis
On day 7 of the experiment, the animals were sacrificed. The left lung was first tied off
and reserved for cytokine analysis. Lung samples were then immediately frozen on dry ice, and
then kept at -80oC until further processed. The remaining lung tissue was processed for
histological analysis. Histology revealed no apparent change due to administration of the drug..
The frozen tissues were transferred to Silver Pharmaceuticals.

Biochemical analysis
Frozen lung samples were weighed, thawed and then minced with scissors in 10% (w/v)
ice cold PBS, homogenized in 10 strokes in a Ten Broeck homogenizer, and centrifuged at
20,000 X g for 30 minutes. The supernatant solutions were kept at -80oC until assay.

The

supernatant solutions were tested by Silver Pharmaceuticals for cytokines and chemokines by
ELISA at Bioassay Works, LLC in Ijamsville, MD. The samples were then sent for corroboration
to Pierce-Thermo for ELISA assay on the SearchlightÒ ELISA platform. Rat antibody reagents
were used in both instances.

Expression of these cytokines and chemokines depend on NFkB, which is blocked by digitoxin.
TNFa, IL-1b and TGFb also activate NFkB. In addition, interferon gamma (INFg) is blocked by
digitoxin. INFg also indirectly activates NFkB. Digitoxin activates caspase 3, which, proteolyzes
NFAT. Experiments with SARS-CoV show that inhibition of NFkB suppresses cytokine storm
