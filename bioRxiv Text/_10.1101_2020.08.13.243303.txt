Abstract
Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infects cells by binding to the host
cell receptor Ace2 and undergoing virus-host membrane fusion. Fusion is triggered by the protease
TMPRSS2, which processes the viral Spike (S) protein to reveal the fusion peptide. SARS-CoV-2 has
evolved a multibasic site at the S1-S2 boundary, which is thought to be cleaved by furin in order to
prime S protein for TMPRSS2 processing. Here we show that CRISPR-Cas9 knockout of furin reduces,
but does not prevent, the production of infectious SARS-CoV-2 virus. Comparing S processing in furin
knockout cells to multibasic site mutants reveals that while loss of furin substantially reduces S1-S2
cleavage it does not prevent it. SARS-CoV-2 S protein also mediates cell-cell fusion, potentially
allowing virus to spread virion-independently. We show that loss of furin in either donor or acceptor
cells reduces, but does not prevent, TMPRSS2-dependent cell-cell fusion, unlike mutation of the
multibasic site that completely prevents syncytia formation. Our results show that while furin
promotes both SARS-CoV-2 infectivity and cell-cell spread it is not essential, suggesting furin
inhibitors will not prevent viral spread.

INTRODUCTION
In late 2019, a new coronavirus was identified in a Chinese province, Hubei, and named severe acute
respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) for its close similarity to severe acute respiratory
syndrome (SARS-CoV-1) that appeared in 2002. SARS-CoV-2 spread rapidly, so that the World Health
Organisation had to declare a pandemic on March 11th. By 13th August, it had infected more than
21 million people and caused more than 750 thousand deaths worldwide. Several studies have
shown that the introduction of the SARS-CoV-2 into humans was the result of zoonotic transmission,
with pangolins acting as an intermediary host between bats and humans (Andersen et al., 2020;
Lam et al., 2020).
SARS-CoV-2 (CoV-2) entry into host cells is mediated by the spike (S) protein, which is a major
surface protein incorporated into the viral envelope (Shang et al., 2020). S protein is a trimeric
transmembrane glycoprotein whose ectodomain includes two main subunits: S1, responsible for
attachment to the host cell receptor Ace2 and for shielding the S2 subunit that contains the fusion
machinery (Hoffmann et al., 2020a). Similar to the fusion proteins of many other respiratory viruses,
S protein of SARS-CoV-2 is activated by cellular protease-mediated cleavage (Böttcher et al., 2006;
Estes et al., 1981; Nagai et al., 1976; Scheid and Choppin, 1984). Activation of S requires proteolytic
cleavage at two distinct sites: in the unique multi-basic site motif of Arg-Arg-Ala-Arg (RRAR), located
between the S1 and S2 subunits, and within the S2 subunit (S2’) located immediately upstream of
the hydrophobic fusion peptide that is responsible for triggering virus-cell membrane fusion (Madu
et al., 2009; Millet and Whittaker, 2015; Walls et al., 2020).
CoV-2 S is a type I transmembrane protein which, besides being incorporated into virions and
mediating viral entry, is present at the plasma membrane of infected cells. Plasma membranedisplayed S protein can trigger fusion with neighbouring cells, leading to the formation of enlarged,
multinucleate enlarged cells (termed syncytia) (Buchrieser et al., 2020; Hoffmann et al., 2020b; Ou
et al., 2020). This event is dependent upon expression of the cell-surface serine protease TMPRSS2,
which exposes the S fusion peptide and makes S protein fusogenic directly at the host cell
membrane (Buchrieser et al., 2020). These syncytia have also been found in tissues from individuals
infected with SARS-CoV-2, suggesting an involvement in pathogenesis (Giacca et al., 2020; Tian et
al., 2020; Xu et al., 2020).
One significant difference between S protein of SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV-1 is that only the former
contains a multi-basic cleavage site (Hoffmann et al., 2020b; Walls et al., 2020). The acquisition of a
multibasic site by insertion of basic amino acids into surface glycoproteins has long been known to
be a central virulence factor for many pathogenic viruses, including pandemic influenza viruses
(Luczo et al., 2015; Schrauwen et al., 2012; Suguitan et al., 2012). This is thought to be because
viruses with a multibasic site are readily cleaved by ubiquitously expressed proprotein convertases
and can thus spread rapidly. In the case of SARS viruses, inhibitor experiments have suggested that
the protease responsible for cleaving S protein is furin (Bestle et al., 2020; Hoffmann et al., 2020b).
Furin is a calcium-dependent protease that recognise and cleaves the specific sequence motif R-XR/K- R, where X is identified as any amino acid residue (Shiryaev et al., 2013; Walker et al., 1994).
Furin is mainly expressed in the trans-Golgi network with little present in intracellular vesicles,
suggesting that it may act on S protein during viral production (Hoffmann et al., 2020b; Izaguirre,
2019). In the context of SARS-CoV-2, the acquisition of a multibasic site in the S protein has been
identified as a determinant of pandemic potential but its precise role in transmission remains

unclear (Menachery et al., 2019; Yang et al., 2015). Here we sought to determine whether furin is
essential for CoV-2 S multibasic site processing and how it impacts both viral entry and cell-cell
spread.

RESULTS
CoV-2 S protein mediates cell-cell fusion between different cell types
Previous reports have shown that CoV-2 S protein possesses high fusogenic activity and is able to
trigger large syncytia formation in vitro and in vivo, contrary to the S protein of two related
coronaviruses SARS and MERS (Hoffmann et al., 2020b). Whether cell-cell fusion and formation of
syncytia can occur between uninfected and infected cells and if it can happen between different cell
types are significant questions in understanding CoV-2 pathogenesis. To address these questions,
we established a CoV-2-S protein-mediated cell–cell fusion assay employing 293T cells stably
overexpressing human ACE2 receptor (herein named 293T-hACE2) (Fig. S1A) and Vero cells, as both
have been widely used in coronavirus studies (Kaye et al., 2006). Our assay is based on the ectopic
overexpression of CoV-2 S together with the mCherry fluorescent protein in one cell type (named
the donor cell) and the labelling of another cell type (named the acceptor cell) with a green
fluorescent dye (Fig. 1A). Mixing both cell types and measuring the kinetics of merged fluorescence
allows precise quantification of cell-cell fusion. Using this assay, we investigated the fusogenic
properties of S protein when at the cell surface. We found that CoV-2 S-mediated syncytia formation
occurred regardless of whether Vero or 293Ts were used as donor or acceptor cells (Fig. 1B,C).
Moreover, we observed similar kinetics of syncytia formation whether we used Vero cells as both
donor or acceptor or just one or the other. Next, we compared the impact of Ace2 overexpression
with that of the protease TMPRSS2, which is responsible for cleavage and exposure of the fusion
peptide prior to fusion. Importantly, overexpression of the TMPRSS2 protease in either Vero or 293T
cells, markedly increased the rate of cell-cell fusion (Fig.1B,C,D, S1A). When TMPRSS2 was
overexpressed on acceptor cells, syncytia formation reached almost 85% within 24 hours post
transfection (Fig. 1D). This indicates that TMPRSS2 can be rate limiting for cell-cell fusion and
highlights its fundamental importance in CoV-2 spreading. The data also suggest that the fusion
machinery of SARS-CoV-2 is an important target for development of coronavirus antivirals.
Furin protease enhances CoV-2 S protein cleavage but it is not required for entry in 293T cells
Furin is widely assumed to be the protease responsible for cleavage of the CoV-2 S protein
multibasic site. However, most studies have relied on indirect methodologies such as small molecule
inhibition or mRNA depletion (Hoffmann et al., 2020b; Shang et al., 2020; Xia et al., 2020). We
decided to investigate the importance of furin directly by generating a 293T CRISPR-derived
knockout cell line (herein named 293T-∆FURIN). We confirmed that FURIN gene had been knocked
out by Western blotting and as shown in Fig.S1B, there is no detectable furin protein in the knockout
cells. We also generated different versions of the CoV-2 S protein harbouring amino acid
substitutions in the multibasic site RRAR – either a complete inactivation by mutation to GSAS
(GSAS) or a RAR amino acid deletion (∆MBS), resembling the S protein sequence present in SARSCoV-1 (Hoffmann et al., 2020b; Spiga et al., 2003) (Fig. 2A,B). We first analysed the role of furin and
the multibasic site in S protein processing by producing lentiviruses pseudotyped with the CoV-2 S
protein in both 293T-∆FURIN cells and 293T parental cells line and analysing S that had been
incorporated into viral particles. While wild-type CoV-2 S on pseudovirions produced in parental

293T cells was 80% cleaved, S protein cleavage was strongly diminished but not absent when
particles were generated in the 293T-∆FURIN cell line. This indicates that S protein processing can
happen independent of furin, but that the presence of the protease strongly enhances cleavage (Fig.
2C). In contrast, pseudoviruses harbouring the GSAS mutant did not show any S cleavage when
produced in either cell line, while the ∆MBS mutant showed decreased but not abolished processing
(Fig. 2C). Taken together, this suggests that furin is not essential for cleavage at the S1/S2 domain
boundary, but the presence of an arginine residue is. Having a multibasic sequence increases S1/S2
processing with a single arginine residue being the minimal requirement.
We next wanted to investigate the impact of these findings on the formation of CoV-2 virus-like
particles (VLPs). In contrast to pseudotyped viruses, VLPs are entirely SARS-CoV-2 proteins,
consisting of the membrane protein (M), nucleoprotein (N), envelope protein (E), and S protein. We
observed that both WT and the ∆MBS mutant S proteins incorporated into CoV-2-VLPs had
undergone cleavage, with almost complete processing of the WT protein and a minor fraction of
the ∆MBS cleaved (Fig. 2D). Processing of VLP-incorporated S protein was furin-dependent, as the
proportion of cleaved S of either WT or ∆MBS mutant was reduced in 293T-∆FURIN cells (Fig. 2D).
There was very little cleaved S protein incorporated in GSAS VLPs and this did not differ between
293T and ∆FURIN cells, suggesting that removal of all basic residues is required to fully prevent S
cleavage. It also supports the hypothesis from the pseudovirus data that evolution of the multibasic
site has substantially enhanced the existing S cleavage at this position, which is mediated by the
single arginine site.
As a final confirmation of these results, we examined S processing in SARS-CoV-2 wild-type virus.
We infected 293T-hACE2 and 293T-hACE2-∆FURIN cell lines and collected produced virus after 42
hours. The pattern of S-cleavage observed was similar to that seen for pseudoviruses and VLPs
(Fig.2E), confirming that Furin carries out, but is not essential, for S1/S2 processing. Moreover, this
data proves the suitability of pseudoviruses and VLPs as surrogate models to study S protein
cleavage.
Next, we sought to investigate how S cleavage at the multibasic site impacts the formation of
multinucleated cells. To test this, we overexpressed CoV-2-S in 293T-∆FURIN or 293T parental cells
and measured cell-cell fusion activity. Overexpression of S in 293T-∆FURIN cells still triggered
syncytia formation when mixed with Vero cells (Fig.3A-B) although with slower kinetics compared
to parental 293T cells (Fig.3C). This result is consistent with the idea that lower amounts of CoV-2-S
cleavage in 293T-∆FURIN cells is able to induce fewer cell-cell fusion events. To rule out the
possibility that furin from Vero cells could cleave S produced in 293T-∆FURIN cells, we generated a
CRISPR-derived Vero cell line knocked out for furin (Vero-∆FURIN) (Fig. S2A). Mixing the two ∆FURIN
cell types, we observed that the absence of furin in acceptor cells further decreased cell-cell fusion
kinetics (Fig. 3D,E), but formation of multinucleated cells still occurred (Fig. 3E, S2B), suggesting that
furin from the acceptor cell contributes to syncytia formation but it is not a major determinant.
Overexpression of the uncleaved GSAS mutant did not induce cell-cell fusion in any of the abovementioned conditions suggesting an essential role for multibasic site processing in inducing syncytia
(Fig. 3A-E). These data together suggest that in the absence of furin, S protein can still be cleaved
by another protease that recognises the multibasic site and is able to induce the formation of
multinucleated cells.
Furin ablation decreases SARS-CoV-2 replication but increases S-pseudovirus entry
Having assessed the crucial role of S cleavage in triggering cell-cell fusion we investigated how furin
processing of CoV-2-S influences the infectivity of viral particles. To test this, we produced both WT

and multibasic site mutants CoV-2-S pseudoviruses in 293T-∆FURIN cells or 293T parental cells and
infected 293T-hACE2 cells. Pseudoviruses harbouring wild-type S were less infectious when
produced in 293T cells compared to viruses produced in 293T-∆FURIN. This difference was lost when
using pseudovirions expressing either the GSAS or ∆MBS mutant S, which increased infection
compared to those expressing WT S, consistent with the fact that furin acts on the multibasic site
(Fig. 4A). Many coronaviruses, including SARS-CoV-1 and SARS-CoV-2 exploit endocytosis for entry
into 293T cells but the role of S cleavage in orchestrating this mechanism is not completely
understood. To investigate how S processing can impact on the endocytic viral entry route, we
produced pseudoviruses in 293T-∆FURIN or 293T parental cells and compared infection of 293ThACE2 cells in the presence of E-64d, a widely used inhibitor of lysosomal cysteine proteases. We
found that S-pseudovirions produced in both ∆FURIN and parental 293T cell lines harbouring the
different S mutations showed a strongly impaired entry in the presence of E-64d (Fig. 4B,C).
Together these data indicate that protease-mediated S processing at the multibasic site is not
required for infection of 293T cells, and that the virus is able to enter via an endocytic mechanism
regardless of S cleavage.
Having determined that pre-cleavage of S at the multibasic site is not essential for pseudovirus
entry, we sought to investigate the role of furin in SARS-CoV-2 wild-type virus replication. We
infected cells with moi of 0.01 and left viruses to spread for 72 hours. Western blot analysis showed
that viral particles produced in 293T-hACE2-∆FURIN cells were markedly reduced compared to
293T-hACE2 parental cells (Fig. 4D, left panel), despite the same total protein content was present
in the sample (Fig. 4D, right panel). Viral titration and plaque assay in Vero-hACE2-TMPRSS2 cells
confirmed this result and showed that loss of furin leads to a reduction in the production of
infectious virus by two orders of magnitude (Fig. 4E). To test whether depletion of furin reduces
virion infectivity rather than numbers of virions, we normalised the amount of virus produced in
293T-∆FURIN and parental cells by nucleoprotein expression and infected Caco2 cells, which are a
model for SARS-CoV-2 infection (Chu et al., 2020). Through immunofluorescence analysis of S
protein, carried out to detect infected cells at 24 hours post infection, we observed that virions
produced in 293T-hACE2-∆FURIN cells were markedly less infectious (Fig. 5F). This suggests that
depletion of furin reduces the infectivity of newly made particles, probably due to the loss of S preprocessing. This result is consistent with the hypothesis that SARS-CoV-2 enters Caco2 cells mainly
by virus-cell membrane fusion(Hoffmann et al., 2020a), and that pre-cleavage of S protein by furin
at the S1/S2 boundary is required in order for TMPRSS2 to access and cleave the S2’ domain and
trigger virus-cell membrane fusion. Thus, furin can contribute to virus spread both by increasing
virion infectivity and promoting S-mediated cell-cell fusion.
TMPRSS2 but not multibasic site cleavages are required for cell-cell fusion
It is thought that TMPRSS2 cleavage of the S2’ domain triggers virus-plasma membrane mixing by
exposing the fusion peptide. Whether TMPRSS2 protease is similarly required for cell-cell fusion and
if this favours CoV-2 virus spreading among cells, is still poorly investigated. We tackled this question
with our cell-cell fusion assay and using a CRISPR-derived 293T cell line knocked out for TMPRSS2
(293T-∆TMPRSS2) as the acceptor cell (Fig.S3A,B). The absence of TMPRSS2 protease on the
acceptor cell prevented the formation of syncytia (Fig. 5A-C) showing that processing of S at the S2’
site plays a crucial role in triggering cell-cell fusion. The GSAS mutant failed to induce multinucleate
cells (Fig. 5A-C) strengthening the hypothesis that S pre-cleavage at the multibasic site can facilitate
the TMPRSS2-mediated processing at the S2’ site to expose the fusion peptide and trigger fusion
between cell membranes.

DISCUSSION
One of the key distinguishing features between SARS-CoV-2 and other related Coronaviruses is the
presence of a multibasic site comprising several arginine residues (R) between the S1/S2 domains
of the major surface glycoprotein S (Walls et al., 2020; Wrapp et al., 2020). The multibasic site has
been shown to result in the cleavage of SARS-CoV-2 S (Hoffmann et al., 2020b). The protease
responsible for this activity is thought to be furin but this is largely based on indirect experiments
using small molecule inhibitors (Shang et al., 2020; Xia et al., 2020). Here we show that genetic
knockout of furin significantly reduces but does not abolish CoV-2 S processing. This indicates that
the multibasic site is also a substrate for other proprotein convertases. One candidate protease that
can play a role in this process is the serine protease matriptase, which also prefers sequences with
R-X-X-R amino acid sequence and has been shown to activate the hemagglutinin protein of H9N2
influenza A viruses that have the cleavage site motif R-S-S-R (Baron et al., 2013; Beaulieu et al.,
2013). In the case of CoV-2 S, we found that the presence of only one R residue between the S1/S2
subunits significantly reduces cleavage efficiency and this is further reduced, but not abolished, in
furin-deficient cell lines.
Importantly, our data show that furin cleavage strongly promotes SARS-CoV-2 replication.
Substantially fewer virions were produced in furin knockout cells at 72 hours post infection. Plaque
assays confirmed this result and showed that loss of furin decreased the production of infectious
virions by two orders of magnitude. This was due to a loss of virion infectivity rather than a reduction
in viral production, as when equal numbers of virions were used to infect Caco2 cells, we saw a
significant reduction in S protein expression, marker of viral replication, over 24 hours. Immunoblot
analysis of viruses produced in furin knockout cells showed that S protein was no longer efficiently
cleaved. Taken together, this data shows that furin is required to pre-process S protein and promote
infection of Caco2 cells. This is consistent with previous data suggesting that SARS-CoV-2 infects
Caco2 cells via plasma membrane fusion and that pre-processing of S is required in order for
TMPRSS2 to cleave S2’ and expose the fusion peptide for membrane mixing (Bestle et al., 2020;
Hoffmann et al., 2020a).
Furin cleavage and the multibasic site is also thought to be important for the ability of Coronavirus
S protein to mediate cell-cell fusion (Buchrieser et al., 2020; Follis et al., 2006; Xia et al., 2020). This
is potentially significant for SARS-CoV-2 virulence as it provides an additional route for disseminating
virus through the host. The ability to transmit between cells in a particle-independent manner also
has implications for pathogenesis, as immune factors, such as antibodies, may be less able to block
this type of spread. We therefore investigated whether furin is required for cell-cell fusion and the
formation of multi-nucleated syncytia. Unlike with pseudovirus infection of 293T cells, we find that
deletion of furin from donor 293T cells decreases S-mediated cell-cell fusion with nearby acceptor
cells. Unexpectedly however, we find that while loss of furin leads to a slowing of cell-cell fusion it
does not prevent it. Furthermore, we still observed syncytia formation when furin was deleted from
both donor and acceptor cells. In contrast, complete removal of the multibasic site abolished Smediated fusion. This suggests that while furin is the main protease involved in pre-processing S
protein for cell-cell fusion, other proteases can cleave at the S1-S2 junction. Thus, while blocking
cleavage of S1-S2 is likely to halt this mode of viral transmission, inhibitors will need to block more
than just furin for complete efficacy.
A clear difference between our cell-cell fusion and pseudovirus experiments was that while
pseudovirus infection and processing data are the same for GSAS mutant and ∆FURIN cells, there is

a substantial variation in cell-cell spread between the two perturbations. As cell-cell fusion provided
a more accurate model for furin-dependence, we used this assay to test other cofactor and cell
dependencies. We found that S protein mediated cell-cell fusion was possible between different cell
types, with no requirement for a particular cell type as donor or acceptor. We also found that
manipulation of 293T cells greatly altered their ability to participate in fusion as overexpression of
hACE2 or TMPRSS2 greatly increased syncytia formation. Conversely, knockout of TMPRSS2 from
293Ts cells abolished fusion. Fusion could not be restored when only donor cells expressed
TMPRSS2. This shows that the CoV-2 S protein feature of forming multinucleated cells is dependent
on the spatial orientation of TMPRSS2 in relation to the S protein. TMPRSS2 must be present in the
opposing cell membrane to activate S protein and induce cell-cell fusion. This has important
implications for predicting which cell types and tissues are susceptible for cell-cell viral spread:
TMPRSS2 and ACE2 are essential but furin is not.
While waiting for an effective vaccine against SARS-CoV-2, antiviral drugs and specific inhibitors of
enzymes involved in viral replication are urgently needed. Our findings indicate that, since furin is
not essential for virus replication, inhibitors currently used against this cellular protease may be
inefficient at blocking viral infection. This study also highlights the targeting of cell-cell fusion
process as a potential antiviral strategy, fostering the development of specific inhibitors able to limit
the spread of SARS-CoV-2.

MATERIALS AND METHODS
Cells
HEK293T CRL-3216, Vero were purchased from ATCC and maintained in Dulbecco’s Modified Eagle
Medium (DMEM) supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum (FCS), 100 U/ml penicillin, and 100mg/ml
streptomycin. All cells are regularly tested and are mycoplasma free.
Caco2 BVDV-Npro cell line was generated as described previously (Hosmillo et al., 2015).
293T-hACE2, 293T-hACE2-∆FURIN, Vero-hACE2 were generated transducing 293T, 293T-∆FURIN or
Vero cells with lentiviral particles expressing hACE2 ORF and cultured in DMEM 10% FCS with 5
g/ml blasticidin. 293T-hACE2-TMPRSS2 and Vero-hACE2-TMPRSS2 were instead generated
transducing 293T-hACE2 and Vero-hACE2 cells respectively with lentiviral particles expressing
TMPRSS2 ORF and maintained in DMEM 10% FCS with addition of 5 g/ml blasticidin and 1 g/ml
puromycin.
Viruses
The SARS-CoV-2 virus used in this study is the clinical isolate named "SARS-CoV2/human/Liverpool/REMRQ0001/2020”, isolated by Lance Turtle (University of Liverpool) and David
Matthews and Andrew Davidson (University of Bristol).
Plasmids
Vectors for viral production, were, for HIV-1 Gag Pol, pCRV-1 (Naldini et al 1996) and for GFP
expression, CSGW (Zennou et al 2004). Lentiviral packaging plasmid pMDG2, which encodes VSV-G
envelope, was used to pseudotype infectious virions (Addgene plasmid # 12259).
For production of VLPs codon optimised plasmids encoding M,N,E,S protein were generated using
DNA gblocks by IDT. The gBlocks were cloned into pcDNA3 using HindIII and XhoI restriction enzyme
sites. pCAGGS-S used for cell-cell fusion assay was generated cloning codon optimised S into a
pCAGGS empty backbone using EcoRI and NheI restriction sites.

pCAGGS-S ∆c19 used for pseudotyping lentiviruses was generated deleting the last 19 amino acids,
from the cytoplasmic tail of the S protein, which have been previously shown to contain an
endoplasmic reticulum (ER)-retention signal (Ujike et al., 2016).
pCAGGS-GSAS was obtained by using QuikChange II Site-Directed Mutagenesis (Agilent
Technologies). The same strategy was used to eliminate PRRA residues from pCAGGS-S harbouring
the pCAGGS-∆MBS.
The plasmids used for CRISPR-Cas9 gene editing were pSpCas9(BB)-2A-GFP (PX458, Addgene ID
48138) and pSpCas9(BB)-2A-Puro (PX459, Addgene ID 48139). pX458 and pX459 were digested with
BbsI and dephosphorylated with FastAP Thermosensitive Alkaline Phosphatase. Primers containing
gRNA sequences were annealed and phosphorylated by T4 Polynucleotide Kinase and the annealed
oligonucleotides were inserted into the pX458 or pX459 vector by ligation. The following gRNA
sequences were used: 5′ -GATGCGCACAGCCCACGTGT- 3′ targeting human FURIN (in pX459,
pJC142), 5′ -CGGATGCACCTCGTAGACAG- 3′ and 5′ -TGTGCCAAAGCTTACAGACC- 3′ targeting human
TMPRSS2 (in pX459, pJC144 and pJC146 respectively) and 5′ -ATGCTTCCGTGCCACGCTAT- 3′, 5′ GCTGAGGTCCTGGTTGCTAT- 3′ and 5′ -CGGTGCTATAGTGTGTATCG- 3′ targeting African green
monkey FURIN (in pX458, pJC228, pJC229 and pJC232).
Virus stock
SARS-CoV-2 stock was prepared in Vero hACE2-TMPRSS2 cells. Cells were infected with 0.01 MOI of
virus and incubated for 3 days. Virus stock was harvested by three freeze-thaw cycles followed by 5
min 300xg spin to remove cell debris. Titers were assessed by plaque assays in Vero hACE2/TMPRSS2
cells.
Preparation of S pseudotyped HIV-1 virions
Replication deficient VSV-G or SARS CoV-2 pseudotyped HIV-1 virions were produced in 293T wildtype (293T-wt) cells by transfection with pMDG2 or pCAGGS-S ∆c19, pCRV GagPol and CSGW as
described previously (Price, Jacques et al. 2014). Viral supernatants were filtered through a 0.45μm
syringe filter at 48 hours post-transfection and pelleted through a 20% sucrose cushion for 2hrs at
28000 rpm. Pelleted virions were drained and then resuspended in OptiMem.
VLP production and S analysis
SARS-CoV-2 VLPs were produced by transfecting 2x106 293T-wt cells in T75 flasks with 25 μg total
DNA using Fugene6 (Promega). The codon optimised plasmids expressing SARS-CoV-2 M, N, E, and
S proteins were transfected in a ratio of 1:5:5:1. VLPs were harvested 48 h post transfection from
the culture supernatants, cleared by 0.45 μm filtration, and partially purified by pelleting through a
20% sucrose layer for 2hours at 28000 rpm. VLP pellets were resuspended in 50 μl of DMEM, and
the 20l were loaded on the 4-12% Bis-Tris gel for WB analyses.
Generation of hACE2 and TMPRSS2 lentiviral particles
For the generation of hACE2 over-expressing 293T cells, the human hACE2 ORF was PCR amplified
from Addgene plasmid 1786 and C-terminally fused with the porcine teschovirus-1-derived P2A
cleavage sequence (ATNFSLLKQAGDVEENPGP) followed by the blasticidin resistance gene. This
continuous, single ORF expression cassette was transferred into pLenti6-Dest_neo by gateway
recombination. The TMPRSS2 (gene bank accession number AF123453.1) ORF was synthesised and
cloned into pLenti6-Dest_Puro by gateway recombination. Lentiviral particles were generated by
co-transfection of 293T cells with pLenti6-Dest_neo_ACE2-2A-Bla or pLenti6-Dest_Puro_TMPRSS2
together with pCMVR8.74 (Addgene plasmid 22036) and pMD2.G (Addgene plasmid 12259) using
PEI. Supernatant containing virus particles was harvested after 48 h, 0.45 um filtered, and used to

infect cells to generate stable cell lines. Transduced cells stably expressing hACE2 or TMPRSS2 were
selected with 5 g/ml blasticidin and 1 g/ml puromycin, respectively.
Generation of 293T-∆FURIN and 293T-∆TMPRSS2
293T cells were grown to ~70% confluence and transfected with a mixture of 2 µg of DNA encoding
the gRNA and 6 μL of Polyethylenimine (PEI, Polysciences catalogue #24765, diluted to 1 mg/mL in
PBS) in 100 µL Opti-MEM. Cells were transfected with 2 μg of pJC142 to knock-out FURIN or cotransfected with 1 µg of pJC144 and 1 µg of pJC146 to knock-out TMPRSS2. 48 hours later, the cells
were trypsinized and replated in complete medium containing 1.5 µg/mL puromycin. 48 hours later
(day 4), cells were diluted to 1 cell per two wells in 96-well plates and grown in non-selective
complete medium. Single colonies that grew were expanded and analysed by immunoblotting for
∆FURIN clones and genotyping PCR for ∆TMPRSS2 clones.
For the generation of Vero-∆FURIN were co-transfected with the plasmids pJC228, pJC229 and
pJC232 in which a mixture containing 0.66 μg of each plasmid and 6 µL of PEI in 100 µL opti-MEM
was added to cells. 48 hours later, cells were trypsinized and single GFP positive cells were sorted
into each well of 96-well plates using a Synergy 1 FACS sorter. Single colonies were expanded and
analysed by Immunoblotting.
S pseudotypes infection experiments
Cells were plated into 96 well plates at a density of 7.5x103 cells per well and allowed to attach
overnight. Viral stocks were titrated in triplicate by addition of virus onto cells. Infection was
measured through GFP expression measured by visualisation on an Incucyte Live cell imaging system
(Sartorius). Infection was enumerated as GFP positive cell area. For treatment with the inhibitor E64d, cells were pre-treated with 25µM for 2hours prior to addition of the virus.
Cell-cell fusion assay
Acceptor cells and donor cells were seeded at 70% confluency in a 24 multiwell plate. Donor cells
were co-transfected with 1.5 g pCAGGS-S and 0,5 g pmCherry-N1 using 6 l of Fugene 6 following
the manufacturer’s instructions (Promega). Acceptor cells were treated with CellTracker™ Green
CMFDA (5-chloromethylfluorescein diacetate) (Thermo Scientific) for 30 minutes according to the
manufacturer instructions. Donor cells were then detached 5 hours post transfection, mixed
together with the green-labelled acceptor cells and plated in a 12 multiwell plate. Cell-cell fusion
was measured using an Incucyte and determined as the proportion of merged area to green area
over time. Data were then analysed using Incucyte software analysis and plotted using Prism 8
software.
SARS-CoV-2 plaque assay
Vero hACE2-TMPRSS2 cells were seeded on 12-well plates day prior infection. Next day cells were
infected with serial dilutions of the supernatant -1 to -6 for 1h and then overlayed with 0.05%
agarose in 2% FBS DMEM. After 3 days cells were fixed with 4% formaldehyde and stained with 0.1%
toluidine blue.
Virus infection
293T-hACE2 or 293T-hACE2-∆FURIN cells were infected with MOI of 0.1 or 0.01 and incubated for
42 hours or 72 hours depending on the experiment. To concentrate released virions supernatant
was incubated with 10 % PEG6000 (4h at RT) and then pelleted by 30min spin at 12 000xg. Pellets
were resuspended directly in Laemmli buffer with 1mM DTT. Cells were lysed with Laemmli buffer

with 1mM DTT and then treated with Benzonase Nuclease(70664 Millipore) and sonicated prior
loading for gel electrophoresis.

Genotyping PCR
293T-∆TMPRSS2 cells were screened by genotyping PCR. Genomic DNA was extracted from wildtype and ΔTMPRSS2 293T cell lines using the Puregene cell kit according to the manufacturer’s
instructions (Qiagen, #158388). Co-transfection of pJC144 (guide 1) and pJC146 (guide 2) was
expected to result in the deletion of a large part of the TMPRSS2 gene and in order to screen for
large deletions, a pair of primers labelled as primers 1 and 3 (oJC545 5’ GCCACCGCACCCAGCCTTGTAGTAC- 3’ and oJC554 5’ -TTCCAGCAGCAGAACCACGCC- 3’) were used
for PCR amplification. For alleles in which large deletions had not occurred, smaller frameshiftinducing indels caused by guide 1 in the second exon were screened by PCR using the primer pair
primer 1 and 2 (oJC545 and oJC552 5’ GCGACAGTGGTGTTGGGAGCAG 3’). All PCR reactions were
conducted using Phusion polymerase (NEB) according to the manufacturer’s instructions with GC
buffer, 1.2% DMSO, 2 ng/μl genomic DNA, an extension time of 16 seconds and an annealing
temperature of 64C. PCR products were resolved on 2.4% agarose gels with SYBR Safe (Thermo
Fischer Scientific, #S33102) and relevant bands were excised from the gels, purified using the Qiagen
gel extraction kit (#28704, used according to the manufacturer’s instructions) and sanger sequenced
using primer 1 or 3. Alignments of sequence trace files were generated using Snapgene.

Western Blot
Cells lines were mechanically resuspended in culture medium and centrifuged at 300 x g for 5
minutes at 4°C. Cells were washed once in PBS and resuspended in 1x LDS Sample buffer with 
mercaptoethanol or in lysis buffer containing 50 mM Tris HCl pH 7.4, 150 mM NaCl, 1 mM EDTA,
0.1% Triton X-100, 1 mM PMSF (Sigma) and 1x cOmplete EDTA-free protease inhibitor cocktail
(Roche). Cells were treated with Benzonase Nuclease (70664 Millipore) or were incubated on ice for
a further 10 minutes prior to the clarification of the lysate at 16,100 x g for 10 minutes at 4°C
respectively. Samples were then sonicated and incubated at 90°C for 5 minutes. Samples were then
run on 4%–12% Bis Tris gels and transferred onto nitrocellulose membranes using an iBlot (Life
Technologies).
Membranes were blocked for 1 hour in 5% non-fat milk in PBS + 0.1% Tween-20 (PBST) at room
temperature with agitation, incubated in primary antibody diluted in 5% non-fat milk in PBST
overnight at 4°C with agitation, washed four times in PBST for 5 minutes at room temperature with
agitation and incubated in secondary antibody diluted in 5% non-fat milk in PBST for 1 hour with
agitation at room temperature. Membranes were washed four times in PBST for 5 minutes at room
temperature with agitation and imaged directly using a ChemiDoc MP imaging system (Bio-Rad).
Alternatively, blots probed with an anti-Alexa Fluor 488 secondary antibody were imaged using a
Typhoon biomolecular imager (Cytivia).
The primary antibodies used were: anti-furin (1:1000, Abcam #ab3467), anti-α tubulin (1:250,
YL1/2), anti-SARS-CoV-2 S (Invitrogen, PA1-41165); anti-SARS-CoV-2 Nucleoprotein (ABIN129544).
The secondary antibodies were anti-rabbit HRP conjugate (1:10000, Invitrogen 31462), anti- actin
HRP (1:5000; sc-47778), anti-rat Alexa Fluor 488 (1:3000; Thermo Fischer Scientific A-21208).

Infection of 293T-hACE2 cells with HIV pseudotyped expressing GFP and harbouring CoV-2 S
mutants, measured as proportion of cell area expressing GFP. Viruses were produced in either 293Twt or 293T-∆FURIN cells. (B) and (C) Infection of 293T-hACE2 cells with HIV pseudotyped with CoV2 S mutants as in (A), but pre-treated for 2 hours with either DMSO or 25µM lysosomal inhibitor E64d as indicated. (D) Representative western blot analysis showing viral particles produced from
SARS-CoV-2 infection of 293T-hACE2 and 293T-hACE2-∆FURIN cells at 72 hours post infection. Spike
and nucleoprotein are detected (left panel). Total protein content by Coomassie staining is shown
(right panel). (E) Plaque assay showing infection of Vero-hACE2-TMPRSS2 with viruses produced as
in D. (F) Immunofluorescence micrographs displaying infection of Caco2 BVDV-Npro cells with
normalised amounts of SARS-CoV-2 virus produced in 293T-hACE2 and 293T-hACE2-∆FURIN cells.
Spike (green) and nuclei (blue) are shown. Scale bar, 50 m.

Figure S3. Deletion of TMPRSS2 in 293T cells by CRISPR-Cas9 gene editing. (A) A schematic
illustrating the strategies for the deletion of TMPRSS2 and for screening deletion clones by
genotyping PCR. Blue rectangles (exons), black lines (introns), scale bar = 1000 bp. Guide 1 was
designed to target an early constitutive exon while Guide 2 targeted a region near the 5’UTR so as
to remove a large region of the open reading frame and/or cause early frameshift-inducing indels.
A pair of primers 1 and 2 was used to screen for indels by sanger sequencing (see inset) while a pair
of primers 1 and 3 was used to screen for large genomic deletions by agarose gel resolution (B)
Genotyping PCRs were conducted in duplicate.
