Abstract
Objectives
Two of the main target tissues of SARS-coronavirus 2 are the oral cavity
pharynx-larynx epithelium, the main virus entry site, and the lung epithelium.
The virus enters host cells through binding of the Spike protein to ACE2
receptor and subsequent S priming by the TMPRSS2 protease. Herein we
aim to assess differences in both ACE2 and TMPRSS2 expression in normal
tissues from oral cavity-pharynx-larynx and lung tissues as well as neoplastic
tissues from the same histological areas. The information provided in this
study may contribute to better understanding of SARS-coronavirus 2 ability to
interact with different biological systems and contributes to cumulative
knowledge on potential mechanisms to inhibit its diffusion.

Materials and Methods
The study has been conducted using The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) and
the Regina Elena Institute (IRE) databases and validated by experimental
model in HNSCC and Lung cancer cells. Data from one COVID19 positive
patient who was operated on for HNSCC was also included. We have
analyzed 478 tumor samples and 44 normal samples from TCGA HNSCC
cohort for whom both miRNA and mRNA sequencing was available. The
dataset included 391 HPV- and 85 HPV+ cases, with 331 P53 mutated and
147 P53 wild type cases respectively. 352 out of 478 samples were male and
126 female. In IRE cohort we analyzed 66 tumor samples with matched
normal sample for miRNA profiling and 23 tumor\normal matched samples for
mRNA profiling. 45 out of 66 tumors from IRE cohort were male and 21
female, 38 were P53 mutated and 27 wild type. Most patients (63 of 66) in
IRE cohort were HPV negative. Normalized TCGA HNSCC gene expression
and miRNA expression data were obtained from Broad Institute TCGA
Genome Data Analysis Center (http://gdac.broadinstitute.org/). mRNA
expression data from IRE cohort used in this study has been deposited to
NCBI’s Gene Expression Omnibus and is accessible through GEO series
accession number GSE107591. In order to inference about potential
molecular modulation of TMPRSS2, we also included miRNAs expression for
the 66 IRE cohort matched tumor and normal samples from Agilent platform.
DNA methylation data for TCGA tumors were obtained from Wanderer
(http://maplab.imppc.org/wanderer/). We used miRWalk and miRNet web
tools for miRNA-target interaction prediction and pathway enrichment
analysis. The correlation and regression analyses as well as the miRNA and
gene modulation and the survival analysis were conducted using Matlab
R2019.
Results
TMPRSS2 expression in HNSCC was significantly reduced compared to the
normal tissues and had a prognostic value in HNSCC patients. Reduction of
TMPRSS2 expression was more evident in women than in men, in TP53
mutated versus wild TP53 tumors as well as in HPV negative patients
compared to HPV positive counterparts. Functionally, we assessed the
multivariate effect on TMPRSS2 in a single regression model. We observed
that all variables had an independent effect on TMPRSS2 in HNSCC patients
with HPV negative, TP53 mutated status and with elevated TP53-dependent
Myc-target genes associated with low TMPRSS2 expression. Investigation of
the molecular modulation of TMPRSS2 in both HNSCC and lung cancers
revealed that expression of microRNAs targeting TMPRSS2 anti-correlated in
both TCGA and IRE HNSCC datasets, while there was not evidence of
TMPRSS2 promoter methylation in both tumor cohorts. Interestingly, the anticorrelation between microRNAs and TMPRSS2 expression was corroborated
by testing this association in a SARS-CoV-2 positive HNSCC patient.
Conclusions
Collectively, these findings suggest that tumoral tissues, herein exemplified by
HNSCC and lung cancers might be more resistant to SARS-CoV-2 infection
due to reduced expression of TMPRSS2. The protective mechanism might

occur, at least partially, through the aberrant activation of TMPRSS2 targeting
microRNAs; thereby providing strong evidence on the role of non-coding RNA
molecule in host viral infection. These observations may help to better assess
the frailty of SARS-CoV-2 positive cancer patients.

Introduction
Unlike other members of the Coronaviridae that circulate in the human
population and cause only mild respiratory disease, severe acute respiratory
syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is a novel betacoronavirus which is
transmitted from animals to humans and severely affects pulmonary
respiration (1-5). SARS-CoV-2 enters host cells through the binding of Spike
protein to ACE2 receptor and subsequent S protein priming performed by host
proteases including TPMRSS2 (6-8).
HNSCC is the sixth leading cancer by incidence worldwide and the eighth
most common cause of cancer death (9). Although in the past two decades
new surgical and medical treatments have improved patients’ quality of life,
the 5-year survival remains 40–50% of patients (10). HNSCC is typically
characterized by a high incidence of local recurrences, which are the most
common cause of death in HNSCC patients, occurring in 60% of the cases
(11). The current standard therapies are surgical and systemic treatment
followed by adjuvant radiotherapy (RT) with or without chemotherapy.
Unfortunately, advances in treatments for HNSCC over the past two decades
failed to substantially improve the overall disease outcome, with radio and
chemo-resistance (intrinsic or acquired) remains one of the major challenges
in the current therapy of HNSCC.
Here we sought to investigate the expression of both ACE2 and TMPRSS2 in
head and neck cancer specimens. We found that unlike ACE2, whose
expression was unchanged in HNSCC patients, TPMRSS2 expression was
significantly reduced in tumor tissues compared to non-tumorous ones in both
HNSCC TCGA and IRE datasets. Notably, TMPRSS2 downregulation
associated with poorer survival in HNSCC patients with TP53 mutations, HPV
negative status, aberrant MYC activation and low immune signature.
Mechanistically, downregulation of TMPRSS2 significantly correlated with
aberrant upregulation of specific microRNAs, which might target TMPRSS2
post-transcriptionally, thereby leading to its reduced expression levels in
tumor tissues. microRNAs are an abundant class of small noncoding RNAs of
approximately 22 nucleotides long. They act as negative regulators of gene
expression at the post-transcriptional level, by binding their target mRNAs
through imperfect base pairing with the respective 3’-untranslated region (3’UTR). Deregulation of microRNAs leads to an altered expression of genes
involved in many cell functions and cell fate regulation. Therefore, by
regulating genes and pathways, microRNAs could contribute to modulate
biological functions including potential effect on epithelial cell interaction with
viruses and tumorigenesis (12, 13). We found that the expression of a group
of microRNAs (miR-193b-3p; miR-503-5p; miR-455-5p; miR-31-3p; miR-193b5p; miR-2355-5p) was anti-correlated to that of their target TMPRSS2. This
anti-correlated expression was also evidenced in an HNSCC patient positive
for SARS-CoV-2 infection.

Results
ACE2 and TMPRSS2 expression in HNSCC patients.
To test our hypothesis, we first assessed the expression of both ACE2 and
TMPRSS2 in TCGA HNSCC dataset. We found that while ACE2 expression
level was comparable between non-tumorous versus malignant tissues, the
TMPRSS2 expression was significantly downregulated in HNSCC patient
samples (Fig.1A-B). Interestingly, while female patients showed a more
pronounced downregulation of TMPRSS2 than males (Fig. 1C), the level of
ACE2 expression in female patients was upregulated (Suppl. Fig.1A).
To validate these observations, we have assessed the expression of
TMPRSS2 in an additional cohort of HNSCC patients enrolled at Regina
Elena Cancer Institute (14). This cohort includes naïve HNSCC patients for
which tumor and peritumoral tissues and resection margin specimens are
available (15). Confirming our findings, TMPRSS2 expression was
significantly reduced in tumor samples compared to non-tumorous tissues
(Fig.1D). Interestingly, expression of TMPRSS2 was significantly higher in
tumors from larynx and pharynx compared to malignancies of the oral cavity
(Fig.1E). In non-tumorous tissues from either TCGA or IRE datasets no
correlation between the TPMRSS2 expression and sex or histological site
(oral cavity, larynx and pharynx) was detected (Suppl. Fig.1B).
To further assess the pattern of TMPRSS2 expression in normal
tissues, we have used ATLAS, and showed data of transcript and protein
expression of different tissue sites from which HNSCC develops (Fig.1F).
Lung tissue was included as a reference, as high expression of TMPRSS2
was reported in lung by RNA-Seq and proteomic analyses conducted by
several studies (Fig.1F). A widespread expression of TMPRSS2 was
evidenced in lung and head neck tissues (Fig.1F).
TMPRSS2 expression is prognostic and associates with TP53 mutations
and HPV status in HNSCC patients.
As for many human cancers, TP53 is the most frequently mutated gene in
HNSCC (9). In TCGA dataset, which includes 478 HNSCC molecularly well
characterized cases, we found that patients carrying TP53 mutation exhibited
a significantly lower level of TMPRSS2 expression compared to the patients
with intact TP53 gene (Fig.2A).
Since the vast majority of TP53 mutated patients are HPV negative, we
next looked at HPV negative cohort independently, and found that TMPRSS2
expression was substantially lower in HPV negative patients than in HPV
positive ones (Fig.2B). TMPRSS2 expression did not vary accordingly to N
status (Fig.2C). As it was previously reported that patients with HNSCC HPV
negative and TP53 mutated cancer exhibit shorter overall survival (OS) and
disease free survival (DFS) (16), we next performed a Kaplan Meyer analysis
on data obtained from TCGA database, which revealed that lower TMPRSS2
expression associated with shorter OS and DFS in HNSCC patients (Fig.2DE).

We have next analysed the role of TMPRSS2 using two HNSCC cell lines
(Cal-27 and Detroit-562) carrying TP53 mutations that exert gain of function
activities. When p53 protein in these cell lines was depleted, expression of
TMPRSS2 transcript was significantly up-regulated (Fig.2F), suggesting that
mutant p53 oncogenic protein may regulate (either directly or indirectly)
TMPRSS2 expression in HNSCC cell lines. We also analysed Cal-27, and
Detroit-562 cell lines depleted for YAP and MYC, two important co-factors of
transcriptional activity of gain of function mutant p53 proteins (17). Unlike
mutant p53, neither YAP nor MYC depletion did not affect the TMPRSS2 level
in these cell lines (Fig.2F). ACE2 expression was unaffected by mutant p53,
YAP and MYC depletion in both HNSCC cell lines (Suppl.Fig 2). In summary,
these observations indicate that low expression of TMPRSS2, in a context of
TP53 mutations and HPV negative status is associated with poor prognosis in
HNSCC patients.
TMPRSS2 expression is associated with aberrant MYC activity and
mutant p53 in HNSCC patients.
MYC is a proto-oncogene that plays a crucial role in different steps of
tumorigenesis (18). In HNSCC, aberrant MYC expression is associated with
poor survival (19). In our study, at univariate levels we found that low
TMPRSS2 expression was significantly associated with high levels of MYC in
TCGA HNSCC patients (Fig. 3A).
We have recently reported that MYC is a pivotal mediator of gain of function
mutant p53 signalling in HNSCC (20). We have identified a mutantp53/MYC
dependent signature whose aberrant activation (high expression levels)
associated with shorter overall survival in HNSCC patients (Suppl.Fig.3A)
(20).
Notably, low expression of TMPRSS2 negatively associated with the high
level of this previously reported 22-gene mutant p53/MYC signature (Fig.3B).
It has been extensively reported that mutant p53 proteins actively promote
resistance to therapies, for example by inhibiting the onset of apoptosis (21).
However, failure of patients to respond to anti-cancer therapies is also
dependent on blockade of effector immune cell function by tumor cells
(immune evasion) (22). It was reported that mutant p53 is associated with the
inability of the immune system to recognize neoantigens, which should be
abundant in these tumors characterized by high mutational burden (23). To
explore whether mutant p53 is the driver of immune suppression in HNSCC,
we evaluated the association between TP53 status and immune-related
signatures using the TCGA dataset of HNSCC. In this study we have used an
immune signature reported by Wood et al., due to its high stability in HNSCC
specimens (Suppl. Fig.3B) (24). We found that low expression of TMPRSS2
significantly associates with low immune signature in TCGA HNSCC patients’
cohort (Fig. 3C). The transcriptional crosstalk between mutant p53, MYC/MYC
signature and immune signature was assessed in two HNSCC cell lines, Cal27 and Detroit-562 cells, As expected, both mutant p53 and MYC depletion
reduced the expression of two MYC target genes, HPRT1 and CSTF2
(Fig.3D-E). Interestingly, depletion of mutant p53 protein increased the
expression of both IL-10 and IFNγ transcripts in Cal-27 and Detroit-562 cell
lines (Fig.3F-G).

We next conducted a linear regression analysis which includes the immune
signature expression, HPV and TP53 status as well as MYC signature, to
assess whether addition of the immune signature could improve the total
variance seen in the model which did not include the immune signature.
We subsequently assessed the effect of MYC, MYC signature, HPV status
(positive and negative), the wild-type and mutated TP53 and immunesignature on TMPRSS2 expression at univariate and multivariate levels. The
univariate analysis showed that all the variables were able to significantly and
independently modulate TMPRSS2 expression (Table 1, upper panel). When
the same variables were included in one logic regression model, beside the
immune signature, all other variables have significantly and independently
contributed to the TMPRSS2 expression with a 15% of its total variance
explained (Table 1, lower panel). In general, these findings reveal the
association between TMPRSS2 downregulation with mutant p53 and MYC
oncogenic activities in HNSCC patients, and indicate that the immune
signature did not add any substantial effect when all other variables
contribution was taken into consideration. The lack of independent effect of
immune signature on TMPRSS2 expression could be related to the biological
interdependence of the immune signature with TP53, which has a strong
effect on inducing immune suppression (25).
Epigenetic control of TMPRSS2 expression in HNSCC.
To further investigate the molecular mechanisms underlying TMPRSS2
downregulation in HNSCC we have analyzed the extent of TMPRSS2
promoter methylation. To this end, we used a Wanderer tool that includes
data of methylation specific sequencing for cases in TCGA databases (26).
We compared the TMPRSS2 promoter methylation in tumor versus nontumorous tissues in HNSCC TCGA dataset. As shown in Fig.4A, the intensity
ratio of methylated and unmethylated alleles (β value) was lower than 0.5,
indicating that CpG islands either within or in the vicinity of TPMRSS2
promoter were unmethylated both in tumor and normal tissues. A similar
unmethylated pattern for TMPRSS2 promoter was evidenced in both lung
adenocarcinoma (LUAD) and lung squamous cell carcinoma (LUAS)
specimens, where expression levels of TMPRSS2 were significantly
downregulated (Fig.4B-E).
We next investigated whether TMPRSS2 downregulation in HNSCC patients
could be due to selective targeting by microRNAs. Using miRWalk tool we
searched for microRNAs that could putatively target the TMPRSS2 (Suppl.
Table 1). We have selected a number of microRNAs candidates (miR-193b3p; miR-503-5p; miR-455-5p; miR-31-3p; miR-193b-5p; miR-2355-5p) whose
expression levels were inversely correlated with Pearson R=0.50402; 0.4383;
R=0.42242; R=0.46154; R=0.42246; R=0.46644 compared to that of
TMPRSS2 expression in TCGA HNSCC tumoral tissues (Fig.5A). Notably, we
found that all six selected microRNAs were significantly upregulated in
tumoral tissues compared to the non-tumorous samples (Fig.5B). This
upregulation was confirmed in IRE cohort for all but miR-193-5p whose
expression was unchanged and for miR-2355-5p that was not present on the
arrays used to profile HNSCC matched tumor and non-tumorous samples

(Fig.5C).
miRNet online based tool was used to identify the potential targets of miR193b-3p, miR-503-5p, miR-455-5p, miR-31-3p, miR-193b-5p and miR-23555p (Suppl. Table 2). Subsequently, the identified list of microRNA targets was
assessed using KEGG pathway enrichment analysis to reveal cell signaling
pathways impacted by the aberrant activities of the selected panel of
microRNAs (Table 2). In figure 5D we reported those pathways whose
microRNA validated targets impinged on viral infections and p53 pathway.
To further confirm the negative correlation between the level of TMPRSS2
transcript and microRNAs we assessed the expression of miR-503-5p and
TMPRSS2 in an HNSCC patient positive to COVID-19. 80 years old male
patient underwent surgery in February 2020 for resection of squamous cell
carcinoma (T4aN1G0R1). Two days after surgery, the patient developed
pneumonia symptoms and was found positive for SARS-CoV-2 infection by
nasopharyngeal swab (Fig.6A-C). Excised FPPE tumoral tissue was
assessed for viral gene expression and found negative to SARS-CoV-2
infection (Fig.6D, upper panel). Matched tumoral and non-tumorous FPPE
specimens from a male lung cancer patient who underwent surgical resection
in 2011 were used as a reference negative control and found negative for
expression of SARS-CoV-2 target gene expression (Fig.6D medium and lower
panels). Expression levels of TMPRSS2 were assessed by RT-PCR in COVID
19 HNSCC patient as well as in five lung cancer patient samples resected
from 2011 to 2014 respectively (Fig.6E). Matched non-tumorous specimens
were also analyzed. Interestingly, we found that TMPRSS2 expression was
significantly lower in both HNSCC-COVID19 patients and lung cancer tissues
compared to matched non-tumorous counterparts. Unlike TMPRSS2
expression, miR-503-5p levels were significantly higher in tumors than in nontumorous tissues (Fig.6F).
Both miR-31-3p (located on Chr 9) and miR-503-5p (located on Chr X) are
hosted in long non-coding RNAs, named MIR31HG and MIR503HG,
respectively (Fig.7A). We found that the expression of both MIR31HG and
MIR503HG is higher in HNSCC tumors than in non-tumorous tissues (Fig.7BC) similarly to miR-31-3p and miR-503-5p. Interestingly, HNSCC patients with
high expression of these two microRNAs exhibit shorter disease free survival
(Fig.7D-E).
Collectively these findings suggest that downregulation of TMPRSS2
expression evidenced in HNSCC and LUAD/LUSC is not due to methylation
of its regulatory regions. Our study further suggests that aberrant expression
of microRNAs targeting TMPRSS2, may assemble a post-transcriptional
regulatory network leading to a reduced expression of TMPRSS2 in HNSCC.
This regulatory network might also include other non-coding RNA molecules
such as LNC-RNAs.
Discussion
The present work indicates that neoplastic tissue from SARS-CoV-2 target
organs such as head and neck and lung, might be more resistant to SARSCoV-2 infection due to reduced expression of TMPRSS2 (Fig.8). The study
was based on the bioinformatic and biostatistics analysis as well as on the
subsequent validation of the results in cell models and, as a-proof-of-principle,

in neoplastic tissue directly collected from a HNSCC patient affected by
Covid19. Notably, we found that reduced expression of TMPRSS2 associates
with HPV negative status and TP53 mutations, both of which are important
determinants of poor survival in HNSCC patients. We have recently shown
that MYC as oncogenic protein di per se and a MYC-dependent gene
signature cooperate with gain of function TP53 mutations to foster HNSCC
proliferation and to increase resistance to the treatment (20). Indeed, we
found that depletion of mutant p53 proteins in HNSCC cell lines increased
TMPRSS2 expression, suggesting that mutant p53 contributes either directly
or indirectly to reduced TMPRSS2 expression. Unlike depletion of mutant p53,
silencing of YAP and MYC, two oncogenic co-factors of gain of function
mutant p53 proteins did not have any effect of TMPRSS2 expression (20, 27,
28). While these findings may entirely rule out a possibility that gain of
function mutant p53-dependet transcriptional networks controls TMPRSS2
expression in HNSCC cells, our observations highlight that tumor cells
carrying TP53 mutations may activate post-transcriptional events impinging
the TMPRSS2 expression. Supporting such possibility, we have detected that
the up-regulation of TMPRSS2 targeting microRNAs inversely correlated with
expression of TMPRSS2 in HNSCC. We and others have previously reported
that gain of function mutant p53 proteins are able to either up-regulate or
down-regulate the expression of microRNAs (29, 30). The lack of methylation
in regulatory regions of TMPRSS2 further supports the proposed working
model (Fig.8). Our findings derived from TCGA indicate that similar molecular
mechanisms might underlie the reduced expression of TMPRSS2 in both
LUAD and LUSC, as no evidence of promoter methylation was also
evidenced for lung cancer patients.
These findings further support our hypothesis that TMPRSS2 downregulation
in HNSCC patients was associated with selective targeting of microRNAs, in
particular those which putatively target TMPRSS2. Expression of six selected
microRNAs (miR-193b-3p; miR-503-5p; miR-455-5p; miR-31-3p; miR-193b5p; miR-2355-5p) significantly anti-correlated with expression of TMPRSS2
(Fig. 5B). It is particularly noteworthy to mention that part of the most
significantly predicted pathways targeted by the six microRNAs, were related
to respiratory virus infections (e.g., Influenza A) and other viral infections (e.g.,
Herpes Simplex). The observed microRNA-induced modulation of TMPRSS2
provides a new insight for potential assessment of agents capable of
regulating the microRNA expression and induce TMPRSS2 downregulation,
as SARS-CoV-2 infection prevention strategy.
Clinically, it is increasingly evident that cancer patients represent at least in
part, the most vulnerable population target of SARS-CoV-2 infection. This is
certainly due to many factors, including the aggressiveness of the type of
tumor and the side effects of cancer treatment. Here we provide additional
evidence suggesting that tumor tissues are less prone to SARS-CoV-2
infection than non-tumorous tissues, due to reduced expression of TMPRSS2.
Furthermore, this reduction is more evident in HNSCC patients with shorter
overall survival as well as those with HPV negative status and TP53
mutations.

Cells were cultured in RPMI1640 (Cal27) and DMEM (Detroit 562) medium
(Invitrogen-GIBCO) supplemented with 10% FBS, penicillin (100 U/mL), and
streptomycin (100 mg/mL; Invitrogen-GIBCO). All cell lines were grown at 37°
C in a balanced air humidified incubator with 5% CO2
Cell transfection
The transfections were performed with Lipofectamine RNAiMax (Life
Technologies). All experiments were conducted according to the
manufacturer's recommendations. siRNAs were purchased from Eurofins
MWG
and
sequences
are
as
follows:
si-SCR:
5’AAGUUCAGCGUGUCCGGGGAG-3’;
si-MYC:
5’GCCACAGCAUACAUCCUGU-3’;
si-YAP:
5’GACAUCUUCUGGUCAGAGA-3’; Si-p53: 5’-GACUCCAGUGGUAAUCUAC3’. The cells were transfected for 48-72 hours according to the cell line and
the experiments.
RNA extraction and expression analysis
Total RNA from cells was extracted using the TRIzol Reagents (GIBCO)
following the manufacturer's instructions. RNA from FFPE samples was
extracted using the miRneasy FFPE kit (QIAGEN) following the
manufacturer’s instructions. The concentration and purity of total RNA was
assessed using a Nanodrop TM1000 spectrophotometer (Nanodrop
Technologies). Reverse transcription and qRT-PCR quantification were
performed, respectively, by MMLV RT assay and SYBR Green or Taqman
assays (Applied Biosystems) according to the manufacturer's protocol.
GAPDH and RNU48 were used as endogenous controls to standardize gene
expression. Primers and Taqman assays used are indicated in supplementary
table 2.
SARS-CoV-2 detection
For the detection of SARS-CoV-2 in RNAs extracted from tissue samples we
used Bosphore Novel Coronavirus (2019-nCoV) Detection Kit v2 (Anatolia
GeneWork). This kit is a Real-Time PCR-based in vitro diagnostic medical
device that allows to detect two regions of the virus in two separate reactions:
E gene is used for screening purpose, where 2019-nCoV and also the closely
related coronaviruses are detected, and the orf1ab target region is used to

Figure 8. Schematic representation of the proposed molecular
mechanism. In normal cell, TMPRSS2 mRNA translation leads to the
production of the transmembrane-bound serine protease that allows the
internalization of SARS-CoV-2 bound to the ACE2 receptor. On the contrary,
in tumoral cell, in particular head and neck tumoral cell, TMPRSS2 mRNA
levels are downregulated by the targeting activity of upregulated miRNAs,
such as miR-31-3p and miR-503-5p. This might determine a reduction in the
expression of the protease and a consequent inhibition of the internalization of
SARS-CoV-2-ACE2 complex.

percentage of variance explained (R²) and the total p-value of the multivariate
model.
