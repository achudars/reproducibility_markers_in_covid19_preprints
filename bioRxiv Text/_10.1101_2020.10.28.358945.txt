Abstract
Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is the third highly
pathogenic coronavirus to spill over to humans in less than 20 years, after SARS-CoV-1 in
2002-2003 and Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS)-CoV in 2012. SARS-CoV-2 is
the etiologic agent of coronavirus disease 19 (COVID-19), which ranges from mild
respiratory symptoms to severe lung injury and death in the most severe cases. The
COVID-19 pandemic is currently a major health issue worldwide. Immune dysregulation
characterized by altered innate cytokine responses is thought to contribute to the
pathology of COVID-19 patients, which is a testimony of the fundamental role of the innate
immune response against SARS-CoV-2. Here, we further characterized the host cell
antiviral response against SARS-CoV-2 by using primary human airway epithelia and
immortalized model cell lines. We mainly focused on the type I and III interferon (IFN)
responses, which lead to the establishment of an antiviral state through the expression of
IFN-stimulated genes (ISGs). Our results demonstrate that both primary airway epithelial

cells and model cell lines elicit a robust immune response characterized by a strong
induction of type I and III IFN through the detection of viral pathogen molecular patterns
(PAMPs) by melanoma differentiation associated gene (MDA)-5. However, despite the
high levels of type I and III IFNs produced in response to SARS-CoV-2 infection, the IFN
response was unable to control viral replication, whereas IFN pre-treatment strongly
inhibited viral replication and de novo production of infectious virions. Taken together,
these results highlight the complex and ambiguous interplay between viral replication and
the timing of IFN responses.

Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is responsible for the
current coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic. This virus emerged in China at
the end of 2019 (Zhou et al., 2020a; Zhu et al., 2020) and has, since then, dramatically
spread across the world. As of today (October 28th, 2020), SARS-CoV-2 has caused more
than 1,172,000 deaths worldwide, general lockdowns in many countries across the world
and an unprecedented global economic crisis, as well as an undeniable pressure on health
systems. SARS-CoV-2 is closely related to the highly pathogenic SARS-CoV-1, which
caused an outbreak in 2002-2003 in South East China and Hong Kong, with a fatality rate
close to ~10% (Drosten et al., 2003; Peiris et al., 2003; Zhong et al., 2003). COVID-19 has
many of the hallmarks of SARS-CoV disease including fever, breathing difficulty, acute
respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) and death in the most severe cases (Huang et al.,
2020). SARS-CoV-2 is also related to Middle East Respiratory Syndrome coronavirus
(MERS-CoV), another highly pathogenic coronavirus discovered in 2002, causing an
ARDS and organ failure in the most severe cases, and death in ~35% of cases (Zaki et al.,
2012). The estimated fatality rate of SARS-CoV-2 infection is much lower, but still fairly
high (estimated to be ~0.5-1%), and this virus has clearly shown a great potential for
transmission between humans. Four additional coronaviruses, known to infect humans,
circulate in the population every winter, mainly causing common colds: the human
coronaviruses (HCoV)-229E, -OC43, -NL63, and -HKU1.
Together with SARS-CoV-1 and MERS-CoV, SARS-CoV-2 belongs to the genus
betacoronavirus. They are enveloped viruses with large positive-sense RNA genomes of
approximately 30 kilobases. The genome of SARS-CoV-2 shares 79.6% identity with
SARS-CoV-1 and 50% with MERS-CoV (Zhou et al., 2020a). SARS-CoV-2 mainly
replicates in the respiratory tract, but can also replicate in the gastrointestinal tract (Xiao et
al., 2020). Similarly to SARS-CoV-1 and HCoV-NL63, SARS-CoV-2 entry into target cells
is mediated by the Angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) receptor (Hoffmann et al.,

2020; Hofmann et al., 2005; Li et al., 2003; Zhou et al., 2020b). Recently, Neuropilin-1 was
identified as an important cofactor implicated in SARS-CoV-2 entry (Cantuti-Castelvetri et
al., 2020). The cellular serine protease Transmembrane protease, serine 2 (TMPRSS2) is
employed by both SARS-CoV-1 and -2 for Spike (S) protein priming at the plasma
membrane (Hoffmann et al., 2020; Matsuyama et al., 2010). Cathepsins may also be
involved in SARS-CoV S cleavage and fusion peptide exposure, upon entry via an
endocytic route (Huang et al., 2006; Ou et al., 2020; Simmons et al., 2005).
Viral infections are detected by the innate immune system through the recognition of
pathogen-associated molecular patterns (PAMPs) by pattern recognition receptors
(PRRs). PAMPs, which are typical features not found in host cells, are present in the
pathogen or generated during infection, and are recognized by at least three distinct
classes of PRRs: the Toll-like receptors (TLR), the Retinoic acid-inducible gene I (RIG-I)like receptors RIG-I and melanoma differentiation associated gene (MDA)-5, and the
nucleotide-binding oligomerization domain-like receptors (NOD)-like receptor family
member (NLRs), such as NLR family pyrin domain containing 3 (NLRP3). These PRRs
share different subcellular localizations, with NLRP3 and RIG-I/MDA-5 located in the
cytoplasm, and TLR present within endosomes or at the plasma membrane (Park and
Iwasaki, 2020). Genetic studies have shown that mouse hepatitis virus (MHV), a murine
coronavirus, is sensed by both RIG-I and MDA-5, with a critical role of the latter in vivo (Li
et al., 2010; Park and Iwasaki, 2020; Sa Ribero et al., 2020; Zalinger et al., 2015). TLR3
seems to play an important role in the sensing of MHV, SARS-CoV-1 and MERS-CoV in
plasmacytoid dendritic cells (Cervantes-Barragan et al., 2007, Scheuplein et al., 2015).
However, the role of known PRRs in SARS-CoV-2 sensing has yet to be elucidated.
PRR activation leads to the production and secretion of type I and III interferons, proinflammatory cytokines, eicosanoids and chemokines, which can act in a paracrine and
autocrine manner. In particular, type I and III IFNs constitute one of the first lines of

defence against viral infections, through the regulation of hundreds of interferon-stimulated
genes (ISGs), which induce an antiviral state in infected and neighbouring cells. Type I
IFNs include 17 subtypes (13 IFN-α, IFN-β, IFN-ε, IFN-κ, IFN-ω) and type III IFNs include
four subtypes: IFN-λ1 (IL-29), IFN-λ2 (IL-28A), IFN-λ3 (IL-28B), and IFN-λ4 (Lazear et al.,
2019). Receptors for type I IFN (IFNAR1 and 2) are ubiquitously expressed, whereas IFNIII receptors are preferentially expressed on mucosal epithelial cells, as well as liver cells
and some myeloid cells (Kotenko et al., 2019; Wack et al., 2015). Both type I and III IFNs
induce ISGs but type I IFN leads to a more rapid induction and decline of ISG expression
and is more pro-inflammatory than type III (Lazear et al., 2019).
Type I and III IFNs treatments have been shown to inhibit the replication of SARS-CoV-1
(Haagmans et al., 2004; Paragas et al., 2005; Zheng et al., 2004), and more dramatically
that of MERS-CoV (Chan et al., 2015; Hart et al., 2014; de Wilde et al., 2013) and SARSCoV-2 (Blanco-Melo et al., 2020; Dinnon et al., 2020; Hassan et al., 2020; Israelow et al.,
2020a; Lei et al., 2020a; Lokugamage et al., 2020; Stanifer et al., 2020), both in vitro and
in vivo. However, SARS-CoV-2 dampens type I and III IFN induction and subsequent
expression of ISGs (Blanco-Melo et al., 2020; Israelow et al., 2020b; Lei et al., 2020a,
2020b). Upon SARS-CoV-1 infection of mice, a similar phenotype was observed and was
associated with a delayed type I IFN signalling, which was linked to disease severity.
Indeed, type I IFN promoted accumulation of pathogenic monocyte-macrophages,
resulting in lung immunopathology, vascular leakage, and suboptimal T cell responses,
whereas early type I IFN administration or impairment of type I IFN signalling at later
stages upon infection ameliorated immunopathology (Channappanavar et al., 2016).
Consistent with this, the recruitment of proinflammatory cells was dependent on type I IFN
signalling, but not the viral clearance in a murine model of infection by SARS-CoV-2
(Israelow et al., 2020a), suggesting that IFNs might be more deleterious than beneficial in
vivo. However, in COVID-19 patients, the levels of circulating IFN-b were undetectable and

an impaired IFN-a production seemed to characterize the most severe cases
(Arunachalam et al., 2020; Hadjadj et al., 2020). Moreover, neutralizing auto-antibodies
against type I IFNs were found in at least 10% of life-threatening COVID-19 patients
(Bastard et al., 2020). Furthermore, 3,5% of the critically ill patients with severe COVID-19
carried inborn errors in genes involved in the type I IFN pathway such as TLR3, IRF7 or
IFNAR1 (Zhang et al., 2020). Taken together, this highlights a critical role of IFNs in
COVID-19 disease severity and the importance of better understanding the interplay
between SARS-CoV-2 and the IFN system.
In this article, we aimed to characterize cell host responses to SARS-CoV-2 infection and
the role of IFNs in the control of viral replication, using primary human airway epithelia and
immortalized model cell lines. First, we showed that primary human airway epithelial cells
supported high levels of SARS-CoV-2 replication and were capable of sensing this virus,
with a potent induction of genes involved in innate immunity, including type I and III IFNs,
and production of these cytokines in their basal media. However, this response arrived late
upon viral exposure (after 48 h). The naturally permissive Calu-3 lung cell line
recapitulated IFN induction upon SARS-CoV-2 exposure, which validated the use of this
model cell line as a tool to study SARS-CoV-2 replication and induction of innate immunity.
ACE2-transduced, lung A549 and intestinal Caco-2 cell lines were also able to detect
SARS-CoV-2 virus, albeit with different efficiencies. Interestingly, all these cell types could
inhibit SARS-CoV-2 replication to different levels upon type I IFN pre-exposure. Using
Calu-3 cells, we further showed that MDA-5 was the main innate immune sensor of SARSCoV-2 in these epithelial cells. Finally, we demonstrated that type I and III IFN production
elicited by SARS-CoV-2 infection was unable to inhibit replication, supporting the idea that
the timing of IFN exposure is key to control replication.

(obtained

host cell responses to SARS-CoV-2 infection in physiological targets, 3D Human Airway
Epithelia (HAE; MucilAir™ cells, Epithelix) were mock-infected or incubated with SARSCoV-2 on the apical side at a MOI of 0,01 or 0,1. Viral replication was analysed at the
indicated time points, by monitoring the copy number of RNA polymerase RNA dependent
(RdRp) RNAs in cells by RT-qPCR (Figures 1A and S1A). As shown previously (Pizzorno
et al., 2020), these primary cells were highly permissive to SARS-CoV-2 replication.
Immunofluorescence analyses confirmed detection of double-stranded RNA in SARSCoV-2 infected HAE cells but not in non-infected cells (Figure 1B). The basal media was
harvested at 72 h post-infection, and cytokine production was measured using the Human
Anti-Virus Response Panel LEGENDplex™ (Figure 1C). A strong IFN response was
observed, with a massive production of both type I (IFN-b) and type III (IFN-l1, and 2/3)
IFNs. An important induction of CXCL10 (also named IP-10) production was also
observed, along with a more modest induction of pro-inflammatory cytokines IL-6, IL-8 and
TNF-a. A RT-qPCR experiment on samples collected at 24, 48 and 72 h post-infection
confirmed an important induction of IFNB1, IFNL1 and L2 at 48 h and 72 h after infection
with SARS-CoV-2, which was not observed at 24 h, and parallel induction of prototype
ISGs (Figure S1B). Next, a RT2 profiler analysis using the Antiviral Response panel was
performed at 72 h post infection (Figure 1D). As expected, IFNB and other genes
belonging to the IFN system (e.g. STAT1, TICAM1, TLR3, TLR7, TLR8, DDX58, IRF7, as
well as antiviral effector ISGs, such as OAS2 and MX1) were confirmed to be upregulated.

A potent induction of the inflammasome genes NLRP3 and MEFV (encoding Pyrin, also
known as TRIM20) was interestingly also observed, as well as CXCL10, CXCL11, CCL3
and CCL5 chemokine induction. Of note, HAE cells from nasal, tracheal and bronchial
origins behaved globally similarly with respect to their responses to infection (Figure S1C
and D).

Calu-3 cells recapitulate the global responses to SARS-CoV-2 observed in HAE cells
Next, a number of immortalized, epithelial human cell lines were tested for their ability to
support viral replication, in comparison to simian Vero E6 cells (Figure S2). Calu-3 (lung
adenocarcinoma), Caco-2 (colorectal adenocarcinoma) (both known to express SARSCoV-2 receptor ACE2 and TMPRSS2 protease and be permissive to SARS-CoV-2 (Chu et
al., 2020) were used in parallel to A549 (epithelial, lung carcinoma) genetically modified to
express ACE2, together with TMPRSS2 or not. We also genetically modified Caco-2 cells
to express higher levels of ACE2, or ACE2 and TMPRSS2 in combination. The cells were
infected with SARS-CoV-2 and lysed 48 h later to measure viral replication using a RdRp
RT-qPCR. Calu-3, Caco-2-ACE2 and A549-ACE2 supported SARS-CoV-2 replication to a
very similar extent (Figure S2) and were therefore selected for further studies.
Responses to infection were next evaluated in Calu-3 cells (Figure 2). The cells were
infected at the indicated MOIs and replication efficiency was assessed by measuring RdRp
copy numbers (Figure 2A). Whereas replication efficiency increased concomitantly with the
viral input at 24 h, a plateau was reached at 48 h. Cytokine production in Calu-3
supernatants was measured and a very similar response than that in HAE cells was
observed, with a high induction of IFN-b, IFN-l1 and IFN-l2/3, CXCL10 and a slight
induction of IL-6 and TNF-a (Figure 2B). RT2 profiler and RT-qPCR analyses confirmed a
globally similar response of Calu-3 cells to SARS-CoV-2 infection as compared to HAE
cells (Figure 2C and Figure S3A), with a high induction of IFNB1, IFNL2 and a moderate
induction of ISGs. However, these responses happened more rapidly than in HAE cells
(Figure S1B and S3A). Type I and III IFN production in supernatants from infected Calu-3
cells was confirmed using reporter cell lines (Figure S3B and C). High and moderate
induction levels of IFNB1, IFNL2, and prototype ISGs ISG15 and MX1 were observed in

Having established that SARS-CoV-2 infected cells produced high amounts of IFN, we
sought to identify the PRR(s) responsible for sensing the virus. Typically, coronaviruses
are sensed via RIG-I and/or MDA-5 PRRs (Li et al., 2010; Zalinger et al., 2015), which
then signal through mitochondrial antiviral-signalling protein (MAVS). We therefore used

CRISPR/Cas9 to generate cell populations knockout for RIG-I, MDA-5 or MAVS and
tested the ability of these cells to produce type I and III IFNs upon SARS-CoV-2 infection
(Figure 3). We observed that MDA-5 and MAVS depletion, but not RIG-I depletion,
drastically impacted the amounts of type I and type III IFNs produced, demonstrating that
in Calu-3 lung epithelial cells, SARS-CoV-2 sensing mainly occurred through MDA-5.

Figure 3. MDA-5 is the main sensor of SARS-CoV-2 in Calu-3 model cells. Calu-3-Cas9 cells were transduced with
lentiviral vectors expressing CRISPR non-targeting single guide RNAs (Ctrl #1, #2) or single guide RNAs targeting RIG-I, MDA5 or MAVS. Cells were antibiotic selected for at least 15 days and challenged with SARS-CoV-2 at MOI 0,05. The cell
supernatants were harvested at 24 h and 48 h post-infection, as indicated, and the concentrations of type I (A) and type III (B)
IFNs produced analysed using HEK-Blue™ IFN-α/β and IFN-l reporter cells, respectively. The mean of 3 independent
experiments (performed with 2 series of KO cell populations generated independently) is shown, with error bars representing
one s.d. from the mean. C. A representative immunoblot is shown, Actin served as a loading control.

In agreement with previous studies (Felgenhauer et al., 2020; Lokugamage et al., 2020;
Mantlo et al., 2020), we then observed that a 24 h pre-treatment with increasing doses of
type I IFN proportionally limited SARS-CoV-2 replication in Vero E6 cells, with the best
dose being 1000 U/mL (Figure S5). Interestingly, pre-exposure of HAE and Calu-3 cells
with 1000 U/mL IFN potently decreased SARS-CoV-2 RNA amounts in infected cells (by
1,5-2 logs) and the production of infectious viruses (by several orders of magnitude; Figure
4A-B and D-E). Immunofluorescence staining failed to detect dsRNA in SARS-CoV-2
infected cells following IFN pre-treatment in HAE cells, contrary to what was observed in

non-treated cells (Figure 4C). Intracellular spike staining in infected Calu-3 cells showed a
10-fold decrease in the percentage of infected cells following IFN pre-exposure (Figure 4F)
and immunoblot analysis confirmed a potent inhibition of Nucleocapsid (N) and Spike
expression, concomitant with ISG induction (Figure 4G). Of note, type I IFN pre-treatment
had also a very strong impact on infection in A549-ACE2 cells but a milder effect in Caco2-ACE2 cells (Figure S6). It was quite striking that the concentrations of type I IFN used
here for pre-treatment were similar to what was naturally produced by the infected cells
(Figures 1C, 2A and S3A), however high levels of replication were observed in the
absence of exogenous IFN treatment. We therefore hypothesized that the IFN produced
during the course of infection did not have an impact on replication. Indeed, we observed
that MDA-5 and MAVS knockout in Calu-3 cells did not impact viral production, despite
preventing IFN production (Figure S7 and Figure 3). In order to confirm this, we used
CRISPR/Cas9 to disrupt genes belonging to the common signalling pathway for type I and
III IFNs, rather than the distinct type I and III IFN receptors. Hence, we generated IRF9
and control (CTRL) KO Calu-3 cell populations and we observed that IRF9 knockout did
not substantially improved SARS-CoV-2 replication (Figure 4H), whereas the KO cells
were not able anymore to induce prototype ISG expression following IFN treatment (Figure
4I). Similar data were obtained in JAK1 knockout A549-ACE2 cells and similarly unable to
respond to IFN (Figure S8). In line with these results, we observed that contrary to preexposure, IFN exposure 24 h post-infection did not have an impact on SARS-CoV-2
replication efficiency (Figure S9). Moreover, when added as early as 8 h post infection,
IFN treatment had an impact only at the lowest MOIs used (Figure S9).

Discussion
Here, we characterized host cell responses to SARS-CoV-2 replication in primary, air-liquid
HAE cultures and in model cell lines. We confirmed the potent induction of innate responses
following infection of HAE cells with SARS-CoV-2 (Pizzorno et al., 2020), with an important
but somewhat late induction of type I and III IFNs. In contrast to our results, a lack of IFN
response in HAE cells exposed to SARS-CoV-2 was recently reported (Vanderheiden et al.,
2020). Of note, viral production in the HAE model we used was several magnitudes of order
higher than what was reported in the other study (up to 107 PFU/mL in washes from the apical
side, Figure 4B of this study, in comparison to ~2-3.102 PFU/mL, (Vanderheiden et al., 2020)),
which could explain the observed difference in sensing, in addition to inherent differences in

the HAE models used. A lack of IFN induction was also reported upon SARS-CoV-2 infection
of normal human bronchial epithelial (NHBE) cells (Blanco-Melo et al., 2020). However, in
this study, only 0.1% of total deep sequencing reads were from the virus in this cell type,
which was a percentage highly similar to what was observed in wild-type A549 cells (i.e.
devoid of Ace2) (Blanco-Melo et al., 2020), known to be refractory to replication because of
the lack of ACE2 expression. This strongly suggested poor replication efficiency in this
particular model, again explaining the lack of sensing. In support of our data, and in addition to
the aforementioned previous report in HAE cells (Pizzorno et al., 2020), an IFN induction has
also been reported in human intestinal organoids (Lamers et al., 2020; Stanifer et al., 2020).
Using model cell lines, we notably showed that naturally permissive, lung epithelial Calu-3
cells were a good model for innate immune responses to SARS-CoV-2 infection, with a similar
pattern of innate immunity gene induction and pro-inflammatory cytokine production to what
we observed in HAE cells. However, the IFN induction kinetics were faster in Calu-3 cells in
comparison to primary cells, with a robust induction of IFN genes 24 h post-infection (versus
48 h in HAE cells). In addition to IFNs, SARS-CoV-2 infection induced the production of the
CXCL10 chemokine and the pro-inflammatory cytokines TNF-a and IL-6, in both cell types
(and, in HAE only, and to a lower extent, IL-8), but no production of IL-1b, consistent with
observations in COVID-19 patient samples (Del Valle et al., 2020). Interestingly, at the RNA
level, a potent induction of inflammasome-related genes (i.e. NLRP3 and MEFV) was
observed. It will be of high interest to further explore the potential regulation of the
inflammasome by SARS-CoV-2 and determine whether it is activated and, if that were the
case, why there is no IL-1b production by the infected cells.
In agreement with an important role of MDA-5 in host responses to MHV infection in mice
(Zalinger et al., 2015), CRISPR/Cas9 knockout approaches showed that MDA-5 was the main
sensor for SARS-CoV-2 in Calu-3 lung epithelial cells, with no impact of RIG-I in this particular

model. Whether that would be the case in primary HAE cells remained to be determined, but it
has so far proven difficult to genetically modify these cells.
As reported previously in cell lines and in models of primary bronchial epithelial, air-liquid cell
cultures (Blanco-Melo et al., 2020; Busnadiego et al., 2020; Lei et al., 2020a; Lokugamage
et al., 2020; Nchioua et al., 2020), we confirmed that type I IFN pre-treatment potently
inhibited SARS-CoV-2 replication in primary HAE cells and in lung cell lines. However, in the
absence of IFN pre-treatment and despite an important amount of endogenous IFNs
produced upon infection in HAE cells, SARS-CoV-2 replication was highly efficient in these
cells. Similar data were obtained in Calu-3 cells, despite an earlier IFN response than in HAE
cells. This suggested that IFNs were produced too late to efficiently prevent replication, as
proposed in another study (Lei et al., 2020b) and/or did not efficiently induced ISG expression.
In agreement with this, we observed that knocking-out genes essential for type I and III
responses (e.g. IRF9 or JAK1) had not beneficial impact on replication in model lung cell lines,
contrary to what was reported in intestinal model cell lines (Stanifer et al., 2020). Moreover,
adding high amounts of exogenous type I IFN had no real impact on replication when IFN was
added post-infection (even as early as 8 h post-infection, when a high MOI was used),
supporting the idea that the timing of IFN exposure is key to control replication. In line with
this, SARS-CoV-2 has been shown to efficiently dampen IFN responses and ISG induction
through several mechanisms (Konno et al., 2020; Lei et al., 2020a; Miorin et al., 2020; Sa
Ribero et al., 2020; Xia et al., 2020). Indeed, nsp1, nsp6, nsp13, ORF3a, M, ORF7a and
ORF7b inhibit STAT1/2 phosphorylation and STAT1 nuclear translocation is inhibited by
ORF6. Nonetheless, numerous clinical trials are currently evaluating the impact of IFN therapy
on COVID-19 patients and should shed light on whether exogenous IFN could be useful in
this context. Of note, a substantial proportion of patients with severe diseases may well be
unresponsive to such treatments, due to the presence of anti-IFN autoantibodies or inborn

mutations in genes belonging to the IFN pathway, such as IFNAR1 (Bastard et al., 2020;
Zhang et al., 2020). This highlights the importance to identify the IFN-induced antiviral
effectors, which are so potently active against SARS-CoV-2, in order to potentially guide
future, targeted therapeutic interventions.

puromycin, respectively. Caco-2 and Calu-3 cells were obtained from American Type
Culture Collection (ATCC); HEK-Blue™ IFN-α/β and IFN-l cells were obtained from
InvivoGen; 293T, MDCK, A549, Vero E6 cells were gifts from Michael Malim’s lab, Wendy
Barclay’s lab, and from the CEMIPAI facility, respectively. A549 and Caco-2 cells stably
expressing ACE2 and TMPRSS2 were generated by transduction with either
RRL.sin.cPPT.SFFV/IRES-puro.WPRE,

RRL.sin.cPPT.SFFV/IRES-neo.WPRE,

RRL.sin.cPPT.SFFV/IRES-hygro.WPRE or RRL.sin.cPPT.SFFV.WPRE containing-vectors
(cDNA as indicated) and were maintained under 1 µg/ml puromycin, and/or 1 mg/ml G418,
50 µg/ml hygromycinB selection.
For CRISPR-Cas9-mediated gene disruption, A549-ACE2 and Calu-3 cells stably
expressing Cas9 were first generated by transduction with LX_311-Cas9 followed by
blasticidin selection at 10 µg/ml. Cas9 activity was checked using the XPR_047 assay (a
gift from David Root, Addgene 107145) and was 79.5% and >83.4%, respectively, for
Cas9-expressing A549-ACE2 and Calu-3 cells. The cells were then transduced with guide
RNA expressing LentiGuide-Puro and Lentiguide-Neo vectors (as indicated) and selected
with antibiotics for at least 10 days.
Air-liquide cultures of primary Human Airway Epithelial (HAE) cells of nasal, tracheal and
bronchial origins from healthy donors were obtained from Epithélix (MucilAir™) and
cultured with MucilAir™ media (Epithélix). The apical side of the HAE cells was washed
when necessary and 1 day prior to IFN exposure, following the manufacturer’s
instructions.
When indicated, universal type I IFN (PBL Interferon source) was added at the indicated
concentration (e.g. 1,000 U/ml) for 16-24 hr prior to virus infection. For HAE cells, IFN was
added both in the basal media and on the apical side of the cells (diluted in 20 µl of
MucilAir media; of note, 20 µl of media without IFN was added to the control cells in
parallel).

Lentiviral production and infection
Lentiviral vector stocks were obtained by polyethylenimine (PEI; for LentiGuides) or
Lipofectamine 3000 (Thermo Scientific; for ACE2 and TMPRSS2 lentiviral vectors)mediated multiple transfection of 293T cells in 6-well plates with vectors expressing GagPol, the miniviral genome, the Env glycoprotein at a ratio of 1:1:0.5. The culture medium
was changed 6 h post-transfection, and vector containing supernatants harvested 36 h
later, filtered and used directly or stored at -80°C.

SARS-CoV-2 production and infection
The BetaCoV/France/IDF0372/2020 isolate was supplied by Pr. Sylvie van der Werf and
the National Reference Centre for Respiratory Viruses hosted by Institut Pasteur (Paris,
France). The patient sample from which strain BetaCoV/France/IDF0372/2020 was
isolated was provided by Dr. X. Lescure and Pr. Y. Yazdanpanah from the Bichat Hospital,
Paris, France. The BetaCoV/France/IDF0372/2020 was amplified in Vero E6 cells (MOI
0,005) in serum-free media supplemented with 0,1 µg/ml L-1-p-Tosylamino-2-phenylethyl
chloromethylketone (TPCK)-treated trypsin (Sigma–Aldrich). The supernatant was
harvested at 72 h post infection when cytopathic effects were observed (with around 50%
cell death), cell debris were removed by centrifugation, and aliquots frozen down at -80°C.
Viral supernatants were titrated by plaque assays in Vero E6 cells. Typical titers were 35.106 plaque forming units (PFU)/ml.
Simian Vero E6 and human cell infections were performed at the indicated multiplicity of
infection (MOI; as calculated from titers in Vero E6 cells) in serum-free DMEM and 5%
serum-containing DMEM, respectively. The viral input was left for the duration of the
experiment (unless specified otherwise). The viral supernatants were frozen down at -80°C
prior to RNA extraction and quantification and/or titration by plaque assays.

HAE cells were incubated for 2h with SARS-CoV-2 diluted in 50 µl of PBS1X added to the
apical side. The viral input was then removed and the cells washed with 100 µl PBS1X. To
collect the progeny viruses at 24 h, 48 h, and 72 h post infection, 50 µl of PBS1X was
added to the apical side of the cells and collected after a 20 min incubation at 37°C. The
viral supernatants were frozen down at -80°C prior to titration by plaque assays on Vero
E6 cells. The cells were lysed in RLT buffer (Qiagen) followed by RNA extraction at 72 h
post-infection.

Quantification of mRNA expression
3-5 x 105 cells with or without treatment with IFNa and SARS-COV-2 infection were
harvested and total RNA was extracted using the RNeasy kit (Qiagen) employing oncolumn DNase treatment, according to the manufacturer’s instructions. 140 µl of
supernatants from infected cells were subjected to RNA extraction using the QIAamp Viral
RNA Mini Kit (Qiagen), according to the manufacturer’s instructions. 125 ng cellular RNA
or 1,2 µl viral RNA were used to generate cDNAs. The cDNAs were analysed by qPCR
using published RdRp primers and probe (Corman et al., 2020), as follow: RdRp_for 5’GTGARATGGTCATGTGTGGCGG-3’,

ViiA7 Real Time PCR system (ThermoFisher Scientific). For ISG expression, GAPDH
and/or ACTB mRNA expression was used to normalize samples. pRdRp (which contains
an RdRp fragment amplified from SARS-CoV-2 infected cell RNAs using primers
RdRp_for and RdRp_rev and cloned into pPCR-Blunt II-TOPO) was diluted in 20 ng/ml
salmon sperm DNA to generate a standard curve to calculate relative cDNA copy numbers
and confirm the assay linearity (detection limit: 10 molecules of RdRp per reaction).

RT2 profiler
The RT2 First Strand kit (Qiagen) was used for the synthesis of the complementary DNA
strand using 400 µg of total RNA from samples extracted using the RNeasy kit (Qiagen)
employing on-column DNase treatment. RT2 Profiler™ PCR Array Human Antiviral
Response (PAHS-122Z) was used in the present study, according to manufacturer’s
instructions. The ViiA7 Real Time PCR system (ThermoFisher Scientific) was used to
amplify the DNA with a thermal cycling of 95 °C for 10 min followed by 40 cycles of 15 s at
95°C and 60 s at 60°C. Five housekeeping genes (β-actin (ACTB), β-2-microglobulin
(B2M),

glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate

dehydrogenase

(GAPDH),

hypoxanthine

phosphoribosyltransferase1 (HPRT1) and ribosomal protein, large, P0 (HPLP0) were used
as internal controls. The average of the Ct values from these 5 controls was used to
normalize gene expression. Changes in mRNA expression between the non-infected and
the infected conditions were analysed using the ΔΔCt method.

Quantification of secreted Cytokines
The concentration of 13 secreted cytokines was measured in the supernatants and basal
media of infected Calu-3 and HAE cells, respectively, at the indicated conditions, using
LEGENDplex bead-based immunoassays (BioLegend, human anti-virus response panel),
according to the manufacturer’s recommendations. Samples were analysed on a BD

Canto II flow cytometer using the Diva software (BD Biosciences, San Jose, CA).
BioLegend’s LEGENDplex Data Analysis Software was used to analyse data.

Immunofluorescence and microscopy
HAE cells were pre-treated or not with IFN for 20 h and infected with SARS-CoV2, as
described above, for 48 h. Cells were fixed with PBS1X containing 4% paraformaldehyde
(EM Sciences) for 15 min, permeabilized with 0.5% Triton X-100 for 15 min, and
blocked/quenched in buffer NGB (50 mM NH4Cl, 1% goat serum, 1% bovine serum
albumin) for 1 h. An overnight incubation at 4°C with mab J2 (Scicons) followed by
incubation in a secondary anti-mouse antibody conjugated to Alexa Fluor 546 and in Alexa
Fluor 488 Phalloidin (Thermofisher Scientific) for 2h at RT were used to visualise dsRNA
and F-actin, respectively. The transwell membranes were removed from the inserts and
mounted between slides and coverslips using ProLong™ Gold Antifade Mountant
(Thermofisher Scientific). Images were acquired with a LSM880 confocal microscope
paired with an Airyscan module (ZEISS) with a 63x lens. Post-processing of RAW
Airyscan images was performed using the Zen Black software.

HEK-Blue™ IFN-α/β and IFN-l assays
HEK-Blue™ IFN-α/β cells and HEK-Blue™ IFN-l (InvivoGen) were plated at 30,000 cells
per well in a 96-well plate. The following day, media from infected cells (or control cells)
was added and a standard curve was generated in parallel by serial dilutions of type I or
type III IFNs in complete DMEM. After 20-24 h incubation, 30 µl of HEK-Blue™ IFN-α/β
supernatants was added to 120 uL of Quanti-blue™ substrate (InvivoGen) and incubated
at 37°C for 15 min. Absorbance was measured at 620nm using an Envision plate reader
(Perkin-Elmer). The standard curves were used to provide semi-quantitative analyses of
the IFN concentrations produced by the infected cells.

Spike intracellular staining and flow cytometry analysis
Infected cells were harvested at the indicated time points post-infection and fixed for 30
min in PBS1X-4% PFA. Cells were washed once in PBS1X and twice in BD Perm-Wash
buffer and permeabilized for 15 min at RT in BD Perm-Wash buffer. Cells were incubated
on ice for 30-45 min in FACS buffer (PBS1X-5% FCS) containing a 1/250 dilution of Alexa
488-conjugated anti-Spike antibody (GTX632604 conjugated using the Zenon Alexa Fluor
488 Mouse IgG Labeling Kit, ThermoFisher) and washed 4 times in FACS buffer. Flow
cytometry was performed using the NovoCyteTM (ACEA Biosciences Inc.).

Immunoblot analysis
Cells were lysed in lysis buffer (10 mM TRIS 1M pH7.6, NaCl 150 mM, Triton X100 1%,
EDTA 1 mM, deoxycholate 0,1%) supplemented with sample buffer (50 mM Tris-HCl pH
6.8, 2% SDS, 5% glycerol, 100 mM DTT, 0.02% bromphenol blue), resolved by SDSPAGE and analysed by immunoblotting using primary antibodies against SARS-CoV
Nucleocapsid (Bio-Techne NB100-56683), SARS-CoV Spike (GeneTex GTX632604),
Actin (Sigma-Aldrich A1978), IFITM3 (Proteintech 11714-1-AP), MX1 (ThermoFisher
Scientific PA5-22101), RIG-I (Covalab mab10110), MDA-5 (Ozyme D74E4), and MAVS
(ProteinTech 14341-1-AP), followed by secondary horseradish peroxidase-conjugated
anti-mouse or anti-rabbit immunoglobulin antibodies and chemiluminescence Clarity or
Clarity max substrate (Bio-Rad). A Bio-Rad ChemiDoc imager was used.
