ABSTRACT
Biodiversity is threatened by the current exponential growth of urban areas. However, it is still
poorly understood how animals can cope with and adapt to these rapid and dramatic
transformations of natural environments. The COVID-19 pandemic provides us with a unique
opportunity to unveil the adaptive mechanisms involved in this process. Lockdown measures
imposed in most countries are causing an unprecedented reduction of human activities giving us
an experimental setting to assess the effects of our lifestyle on biodiversity. We studied the birds’
response to the Spanish population lockdown by using more than 200,000 bird records collected
by a citizen science project. We compared the occurrence and detectability of birds during the
spring 2020 lockdown with baseline data from previous years in the same urban areas and dates.
We found that birds did not increase their probability of occurrence in urban areas during the
lockdown, refuting the hypothesis that nature has recovered its space in human emptied urban
areas. However, we found an increase in bird detectability, especially during early morning,
suggesting a rapid change in the birds’ daily routines in response to quitter and less crowded cities.
In conclusion, urban birds show high behavioral plasticity to rapidly adapt to novel environmental
conditions, as those imposed by the COVID-19.

INTRODUCTION
Since the first human settlements some millennia ago, the anthropogenic transformation of the
natural environment to build towns and cities has been a hallmark of humanity. During the last
century, urbanization has experienced exponential growth across the world and it is expected to
continue as more people will move from rural to urban areas (1-4). As a result, urbanization has
become one of the most important drivers of global change and a major threat to biodiversity (2, 47). Novel, human created environments, such as urban areas, represent a formidable challenge for
organisms because the magnitude and peace of the environmental alterations imposed by humans
usually exceed their limits of tolerance leading to populations shrinkage and extinction (6, 8). Urban
challenges include combating chemical (3), acoustic (9 10) and light pollution (11, 12), human
disturbance (6, 13), new pathogens (14, 15) and predators (16, 17), and human infrastructures (16,
18). However, some species are able to overcome these challenges and thrive in urban
environments (4, 8, 13). Therefore, a key question in urban ecology is how species cope with
urbanization. Countless studies have demonstrated that adapting to urban environments imply
some kind of phenotypical differentiation from non-urban relatives (8-10, 13). Indeed, organisms
are forced to adjust their physiology, behavior and life histories to the novel conditions imposed by
the city (6, 8). However, the mechanisms underlying the differences between urban and non-urban
dwellers remain largely unknown (7, 8). Observed adjustments are mostly consistent with
phenotypically plastic responses (13), but individual sorting and microevolutionary changes by
divergent selection could be playing a role (4, 6, 8). Perhaps, our inability to disentangle these
mechanisms comes from a deficit of experimental studies in urban ecology (10), in spite of the fact
that human transformed environments provide often ready-made experiments. The current spread
of the novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19) and its consequences represents an excellent
example, as we are involuntarily involved in a major unintended social experiment.
After the declaration of the COVID-19 pandemic in March 2020 by the World Health Organization,
most countries have implemented social and health measures unprecedented in recent history.
These measures, aimed at containing the virus spread, (19-23) have focused on social distancing
and population confinement, as well as the cease of non-essential productive and social activities.
Overall, the measures have contributed to a global diminishing of human activities (24). This abrupt
and dramatic disruption of most human social and economic activities have already had quantifiable
effects on urban environments by marked reductions in air pollution (25-27) and noise (28, 29).
One of the most noticeable and generalized measure has been applying certain degree of
population lockdown, which renders our city streets empty and virtually silent. This situation
provides a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity to study urban wildlife responses to less active, noisy and
polluted cities and gain unprecedented mechanistic insights into how human activities affect wildlife
(24, 30, 31). Product of the human lockdown, unusual observations of animals in urban areas
worldwide have flooded the media and the internet planting in the social imaginary the idea that
“nature is getting back its space” (sensu 32). Although plausible, this idea is, in most cases, based
on anecdotal records, sometimes false (32), without any quantitative scientific investigation
supporting such claim (24).
In this work, we aimed to assess the behavioral responses of birds to the unexpected and drastic
changes occurring in urban environments resulting from the COVID-19 lockdown in a densely
populated area of north eastern Spain (Catalonia). Following China (23) and Italy (20), Spain was
the third country worldwide to impose a heavy population lockdown to stop COVID-19 spread. The
declaration of the national emergency in March 14th 2020 by the Spanish Government imposed the
strictest lockdown measures in Europe. Since then, social restrictions were alleviated progressively
until the end of June (SI Appendix Fig. S1; Table S1). As in other parts of the world, this big halt of
human activities has had significant environmental effects with reduced air contamination and noise
in Spanish cities (26, 27). The severity of the lockdown measures imposed in Spain, make this
country especially suitable to study COVID-19 lockdown effects in urban fauna, as they enjoyed
exceptionally quitter and peaceful towns and cities during many weeks.
We compared bird records collected during the first four weeks of the lockdown in towns and cities
of Catalonia with the available records for the same region and dates since 2015 for urban and
non-urban areas. Historical records were used as baseline data. Overall, we worked with more than

200,000 bird records. Our broad scale approach (hundreds of study sites covering and area of
32,000 km2) at community level (we studied 16 different species) allowed us a robust testing of two
key questions:
1) Did urban birds become more common in response to human empty cities? It can be predicted
that decreased human presence and disturbance allowed animals to occupy spaces that used to
be above their fear tolerance thresholds (6, 32). Therefore, we expected a higher occurrence in
2020 compared to the historical records for the same urban areas. This effect being likely stronger
for shier species (i.e., urban adapters), who are less tolerant to human disturbances (6, 13).
2) Were urban birds more detectable as a consequence of quitter cities? It can be predicted that
decreased anthropogenic noise increased the effective distance of among bird communications (6,
9, 10, 13) and be more easily perceived by observers (33, 34). Moreover, as the masking effect of
human acoustic contamination mostly disappeared, we expected an increase in singing activity,
including potential shifts in its timing, to profit from the new urban soundscape (9, 10, 35, 36).
Therefore, we expected a higher detectability of urban birds during the lockdown than in previous
years, with possible changes in the daily patterns of detection.
To disentangle the effects of individuals’ presence (first question) and detection (second question)
in our bird data, we used hierarchical occupancy models (37, 38), which have been rarely
implemented in urban ecology studies (8).

RESULTS
Probability of occurrence of a species during the lockdown did not differ significantly from the
occurrence recorded in urban areas in previous years in 12 out of the 16 studied species after
accounting for their imperfect detection (Table 1; SI Appendix Table S2). In the four species with
significant differences, three increased their occurrence and one decreased it. As expected, most
of the species (10) showed significant differences in their occurrence between lockdown and nonurban checklists. On average, these species were approximately a 25% more common in the
lockdown checklists than in the non-urban checklists, confirming that most of the studied species
were preferentially urban dwellers.
For most species (10), probability of detection was higher in lockdown checklists than in historical
urban ones, but this difference was not statistically significant in most cases (Table 1; Table S3).
However, most species were less detectable in non-urban checklists than in urban ones.
As we predicted, detectability varied along the day in a non-linear way for all species (Fig. 1; Fig.
S2). Excepting two species, the pattern of daily variation in detectability was significantly different
among groups (Table 2). A difference consistently found in most species was higher detectability
in the first hours of the morning during the lockdown compared to the urban records from previous
years (Fig. 1). In most species, during the lockdown detectability peaked at dawn and decreased
until midday, while in the historical urban checklists the peak of detectability was around midmorning. In fact, the pattern of detectability along the day in the lockdown group resembled more
to the non-urban pattern than to the urban pattern in many species. Predicted detectability at dawn
by our model in the lockdown group was on average a 27% higher than in the urban group (sign
test: Z=3.25, p=0.001).
As expected, in all but one species, chances of detection increased with longer surveys (Table S4;
Fig. S3). In most of them (11), such time effect was significantly different among groups (Table 2),
demonstrating that increasing the sampling time does not always imply the same increase in a
species’ chances of detection. For half of the species, time effect was significantly lower in the
lockdown group than in the historical urban group (mean reduction of 17%; Table S4). This
systematic reduction contrasts with the comparison of time effect between lockdown and non-urban
groups, where for nine species there were significant differences between both groups, but such
differences were disparate (mean change -0.8%; Table S4).

Birds did not occur in higher rates in towns and cities during the lockdown than before it, nonsupporting the hypothesis that birds moved into the human emptied urban areas (32). As the
changes induced by the COVID-19 lockdown were drastic and sudden (SI Appendix Fig. S1) and
did not last enough, they probably did not allow for a colonization process. The few species with a
significant increase of their prevalence in urban surveys during lockdown were, interestingly, the
ones that are mostly urban. As these species are not present in large numbers away from urban
areas, they could hardly rely on non-urban source populations to occupy cities and towns during
the lockdown.
Birds changed their detectability pattern as a consequence of the lockdown. In general, there was
an increase in detection probability, which was especially marked in the early morning. As observed
in non-urban habitats, detectability during the lockdown decreased from dawn onwards, while at
the same urban locations detectability was historically low at dawn and increased until reaching a
peak two or three hours later. It is interesting to note that the Eurasian blackbird, a model species
in urban ecology studies (8, 9, 13, 39, 40), was the only exception to this pattern. Overall, many
species showed a “wilder” pattern of detection during the lockdown in urban areas.
Urban birds during lockdown may have shown this detectability peak at dawn, typical of non-urban
habitats, because of a rapid behavioral response to adapt to the new environmental conditions
imposed by the COVID-19 measures. Birds rely heavily on acoustic communication (9, 10, 35, 36,
40). During reproduction, males sign to attract females and defend their territories, becoming highly
conspicuous and detectable. COVID-19 lockdown was imposed just at the beginning of the
breeding season, when singing activity was expected to be especially high (41). Therefore, there
was a strong pressure to time singing activity to the optimal moment of the day. This moment is
dawn because the physical properties of the atmosphere enhance acoustic transmission (42, 43)
and consequently, birds can reach the maximum audience. Thus, urban birds during the lockdown
may have advanced their main period of singing activity to dawn, increasing their detection at those
hours, similar to what is observed in non-urban areas.
During the lockdown, human presence and activities decreased drastically (Fig. S1, Table S1),
being this especially notable during rush hour, which virtually disappeared (27). During the spring
in Spain, morning rush hour matches with the first hours of light, when birds are expected to be
especially communicative (36, 40, 44). The dramatic decrease in noise during the lockdown
released early morning acoustic space that could be recovered by the dawn chorus. Empirical and
experimental evidence demonstrates that urban birds avoid the masking effect of anthropogenic
noise (9, 10, 35, 36, 45). Our findings match these previous studies, but instead of advancing the
dawn chorus (36, 39, 40, 46), our historical urban data suggests that birds would delay their peak
of activity (and consequently of detectability) to mid-morning. In our study context, this can be
explained because civil and solar time are heavily decoupled in Spain since the country is located
in the westernmost part of its time zone (47). For this reason, if birds in Catalonia advance their
activities before sunrise, they would be still suffering an important overlap with morning noisy
human activities, such as commuting, school attendance, shop opening, etc. (40, 44). Hence, the
best option for birds would be to delay the peak of activity to after the morning rush hour (45).
Moreover, most of the previous studies have been carried out in more northern latitudes (9, 39,
48), where climate conditions can still be severe at night in early spring. Under these
circumstances, individual survival can be challenged by a strong nocturnal energy demand (49,
50). There, dawn singing can become a relevant and honest signal of phenotypic quality of males,
as only those individuals in best physical condition can undergo dawn fasting (39). In Mediterranean
regions, where spring nights are mild, the role of dawn singing as signal of male quality might be
less important. Attracting mates would be the prime objective for singing and consequently, males
would be more pressed to place this activity when interference of anthropogenic noise is at its
lowest. Since sunrise, these lowest levels of noise are just after the morning rush hours (i.e. later
than 9 a.m.), when the air physical properties still keep sound attenuation and fluctuation low (42).
If birds have changed their behavior, this adaptive, flexible behavioral response must have been
mediated by phenotypic plasticity. Lockdown was sudden and the environmental scenario in urban
areas changed radically from one day to the next (Fig. S1) (27). This unprecedented social
experiment imposed by the COVID-19 allowed us to test and support the hypothesis of the high

plasticity displayed by individuals living in urban areas in order to cope with a constantly changing
environment (6-8). However, this fast adaptive response might have been facilitated by a previous
conditioning of birds to weekly rhythms of human activities. Birds change their behavior from
working to weekend days (35, 45, 51) to match with human behaviors. Therefore, birds could
assimilate the lockdown as a very long and especially peaceful weekend. Nevertheless, it would
be interesting to explore the long-lasting consequence at a community level of this environmental
change (48). Weekends are just two days long, while strict people lockdown lasted for at least two
months in most regions of Spain (Fig. S1). One may speculate that bolder and fast-adapting
species would adapt their behavior on a weekly basis. However, during the lockdown, all species
had enough time to adapt to the long-lasting new conditions. In fact, as we have demonstrated, all
of them modified their daily patterns of detectability. Maybe the most urbanite species have
benefited the least of this lockdown as their boldness and higher human tolerance was no longer
an advantage in empty cities.
In addition to the birds’ rapid behavioral response to the anomalous environmental conditions
during the lockdown, observers had certainly enhanced opportunities to detect birds during this
period. Urban areas were quitter than usual (27-29), improving the chances of listening the birds
(32-34, 42). Moreover, absence of people outdoors (Fig. S1) allowed for the display of shy and
distrustful behaviors (6), facilitating bird observations, especially for those less singing species, as
the magpie or the yellow-legged gull. However, these improved conditions for urban birdwatching
were heavily constrained by the fact that observers were forced to stay at their homes and their
sampling area was reduced to what they could see from their balconies, yards or rooftops.
Therefore, improved detection was to some extent counterbalanced by the limited scope from the
survey sites. The observed effect in increased sampling time would support this hypothesis, as we
demonstrated that the discovery rate in most species was slower during the lockdown surveys than
in the historical urban ones.
The differences observed between urban and non-urban environments were expected as habitat
configuration and bird densities are patently different between them. In fact, populations of urban
exploiter birds show usually higher densities in cities than in rural or natural close areas (6-8),
facilitating their detection in urban areas. Such differences may have serious consequences for
monitoring schemes aiming to quantify wildlife occurrence and abundance by standardized
protocols, as the assumption of equal detectability under similar circumstances is usually violated
(33, 38, 52, 53). For instance, one sampling hour at dawn is not equivalent in terms of chances to
detect a species in urban and non-urban habitats. Traditional protocols assume that the best
moment to detect birds is early morning (42, 54), which is actually true, but apparently only in
natural conditions without human disturbance, as we have demonstrated here. If the detectability
peak in most urban populations is reached at mid-morning, their abundance would be
systematically underestimated by usual sampling protocols based on early morning bird surveys.
As there is an increased awareness about the importance of urban bird populations (55), it is
necessary to ensure its accurate quantification, which may imply a redefinition of the most popular
current census techniques (8). Additionally, in this work we demonstrated the utility of occupancy
models and the necessity to account for imperfect detection (52, 56).
The COVID-19 lockdown is revealing the stress, noise and pollution present in urban areas (25,
26, 28, 29). Under normal conditions, bird behavior is altered and the possibility to enjoy the natural
values of our cities is notably diminished (8). Our society should reflect on our urban lifestyle and
how it affects welfare of urban fauna and jeopardizes its conservation. As the world is becoming
more urbanized and animals will be forced to live more often in anthropogenic environments (6-8),
one way to ensure their adaptation as urban dwellers would be by reducing our nosier and more
disturbing activities. Most importantly, not only urban populations of non-human animals would be
benefited, but also ourselves from quitter, more peaceful and less polluted cities.

MATERIALS AND METHODS
On March14th 2020, the Spanish Government declared the national emergency due to COVID-19
outbreak and imposed severe social restrictions. These restrictions included mandatory and

permanent confinement of the population, borders closure, limitations in public transport, on-line
education, working from home whenever possible, and closure of non-essential business and
public services, such as supermarkets, pharmacies or hospitals. One day later, we launched the
project “#JoEmQuedoACasa” (I stay at home) within the citizen science on-line platform ornitho
(www.ornitho.cat). This platform aims to collect wildlife records in Catalonia (NE Spain) from
birdwatchers and naturalists to improve the biodiversity knowledge of the region. Ornitho has been
running since 2009 and has gathered more than 6.5 million records to date. The project launched
during the lockdown aimed to collect information about wildlife responses to the new environmental
conditions resulting from people confinement. In addition to this valuable information, the project
was important to keep engaged birdwatchers in this citizen science program by encouraging them
to continue complete checklists (checklist with all identified species) submission, even during a
period of constrained outdoor activities (57).
Lockdown surveys were conducted between March 15th and April 13th of 2020. During these four
weeks, people was subjected to the most restrictive conditions of mobility and consequently this
period showed the most drastic reduction of human activities (SI Appendix Fig. S1; Table S1).
Therefore, lockdown checklists were carried out only from homes (e.g., balconies, rooftops or
yards) in urban environments. To determine the effect of lockdown on bird behavior, we also
gathered all complete checklists uploaded to ornitho recorded during the same dates between 2015
and 2019. We classified these surveyed sites as urban or non-urban according to the 2017 land
use/land cover map of Catalonia (58). Therefore, we obtained three groups of checklists: urban
lockdown, historical urban, and historical non-urban, which contained a total of 206,509 bird
records. Historical urban data represented baseline data, while historical non-urban data was
included as control data without human disturbances.
All checklists had associated basic information about the survey: site (geographical coordinates),
date, hour, time invested (which was used as a proxy for sampling effort) and observer identity. We
excluded checklists lasting >3 h, as they might be discontinuous surveys. We also excluded those
checklists started one hour earlier or later than dawn or sunset, respectively, as they represented
nocturnal surveys. To correct for the adjustment of daylight saving time at the end of March, we
rescaled recorded hours in civil time to the relevant daily sun events: dawn, noon and sunset, which
were established as -1, 0 and 1, respectively. Dawn, noon and sunset were calculated for every
geographical coordinate and date by the suncalc library [version 0.5.0] for R software (59).
Rescaling was calculated as the quotient between the difference of noon and checklist hour and
the difference of dawn or sunset and checklist hour, depending on whether checklist started earlier
or later than noon, respectively. This transformation allowed to fix the small bias caused by the
longitudinal differences in dawn and sunset across Catalonia as well as by the progressive day
length increase during the study period. Not many observers recorded the number of individuals
for each species. For this reason, we opted to work with presence/absence data.
We selected data for the 16 most common sedentary urban species in Catalonia (Table 1) (55, 60).
We focused only on sedentary birds to avoid seasonal changes in occurrence and abundance
associated with migration. Data from the common and the spotless starlings (Sturnus vulgaris and
S. unicolor, respectively) were merged as Sturnus spp. as both were not usually identified at
species level in most observations due to their high resemblance (61). Both species are common,
well spread, sympatric and share similar habits and behavior (60). Thus, we did not expect
important differences in their occurrence or detectability.
We used hierarchical occupancy models (37) to test for differences in the occurrence probability
and detectability of birds among the three groups. We considered as replicated surveys those
checklists reported by the same observer within the same 1x1 km UTM cell. By combining observer
and location, we avoided variability in detection rates due to observer expertise. We could assume
confidently that observer experience was randomly distributed across our study area. The
equations defining our model were:

where Ψj is the occurrence of a species at site j and ρi is its detectability in the checklist i; groups
L, U and N refer to lockdown, urban historical and non-urban, respectively; time refers to the
duration of the survey; and hour refers to the starting hour. Hour was included as an unpenalized
thin plate regression spline basis function (f) with five degrees of freedom because we expected
that detectability could vary in a non-lineal way along the day (52, 56). Interactions between group
and time and between group and hour allowed to model the effect of these two variables on
detectability within each group. To test the significance of hour and interactions, we used log
likelihood ratio tests. Basis functions were built by the smooth.construct function from package
mgcv [version 1.8-22 (62)], while occupancy models were run with the occu function of package
unmarked [version 0.12-3 (63)] for R. Significance level was established at α=0.05.
During the lockdown, observers recorded 1,289 complete bird checklists at 149 sites. The number
of replicated surveys per site and observer ranged from 1 to 91 (mean=8.7, SD=12.4). Historical
records in urban areas were the scarcest: 1,062 checklists in 410 sites with up to 48 replicates per
site (mean=2.6, SD=5.2). As expected, data from non-urban areas were the most abundant, as
observers usually preferred birdwatching in wild habitats. We gathered 5,849 checklists from 3,113
sites. Although one observer made 84 replicates for the same site, on average, observers in this
group showed the lowest site fidelity (mean replicates=1.9, SD=3.6).

Figure S1. Variation in people’s visiting habits to six categories of places in Catalonia between
March 1st and July1st. These graphs can be interpreted as a proxy for human activity. To
improve visualization, negative deviations are shown in red and positive in blue. The grey band
on to the x axis shows the period of bird data collection. The emergency state in Spain due to
COVID-19 lasted from March 15th to June 21st. Note the forced strict lockdown during the first
two months of this period and the following progressive recovery of activities. Figure data are
freely available from "Google COVID-19 Community Mobility Reports"
(https://www.google.com/covid19/mobility/ Accessed: August 25th 2020). Baseline level (i.e.,
0%) has been calculated as the average from January 3rd to February 6th 2020 (visit the
previous link for further technical details on data calculations).

Naïve columns show the proportion of sites where the species was found during the surveys, i.e. the raw occurrence without correction for the imperfect
detection of birds. Estimate columns show the estimated occurrence of the studied species once the detectability was accounted for. These are the same
values shown in Table 1 of the main text. As expected, estimated occupancy was always higher than the observed (i.e., naïve), demonstrating both
imperfect and variable detection of birds. For the urban and non-urban groups, a column with the differences (Δ) between their estimates and the
lockdown group estimates is provided. The p-values for these differences are also shown. Values <0.05 are in bold. At the bottom of the table, the
average and standard deviation of the studied species are given.

Columns lockdown, urban and non-urban show the probability of detection of the species after 1 hour of survey. A probability of 0.5 means that the
observers may or may not detect the species with the same probability (i.e. flat slope). Except the rock pigeon in urban checklists, in all cases, as
expected, these probabilities were above 0.5 (i.e., increased probability of detection of a species throughout time). For the lockdown estimates, the pvalue testing whether or not this slope was different from 0.5 is shown. In urban and non-urban groups, the p-value shows whether or not these slopes
differed from the lockdown group. The difference (Δ) between these slopes is also provided to enhance result interpretation.
