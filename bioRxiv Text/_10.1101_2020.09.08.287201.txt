Abstract
SARS-CoV-2 is a betacoronavirus, the etiologic agent of the novel Coronavirus disease 2019
(COVID-19). The World Health Organization officially declared COVID-19 as a pandemic in
March 2020 after the outbreak in Wuhan, China, in late 2019. Across the continents and
specifically in Africa, all index cases were travel-related. Understanding how the virus's
transportation across continents and different climatic conditions affect the genetic composition
and the consequent effects on transmissibility, infectivity, and virulence of the virus is critical.
Thus, it is crucial to compare COVID-19 genome sequences from the African continent with
sequences from selected COVID-19 hotspots/countries in Asia, Europe, North and South America
and Oceania.
To identify possible distinguishing mutations in the African SARS-CoV-2 genomes compared to
those from these selected countries, we conducted in silico analyses and comparisons. Complete
African SARS-CoV-2 genomes deposited in GISAID and NCBI databases as of June 2020 were
downloaded and aligned with genomes from Wuhan, China and other SARS-CoV-2 hotspots.
Using phylogenetic analysis and amino acid sequence alignments of the spike and replicase
(NSP12) proteins, we searched for possible vaccine coverage targets or potential therapeutic agents.
Identity plots for the alignments were created with BioEdit software and the phylogenetic analyses
with the MEGA X software.
Our results showed mutations in the spike and replicate proteins of the SARS-Cov-2 virus.
Phylogenetic tree analyses demonstrated variability across the various regions/countries in Africa
as there were different clades in the viral proteins. However, a substantial proportion of these
mutations (90%) were similar to those described in all the other settings, including the Wuhan
strain. There were, however, novel mutations in the genomes of the circulating strains of the virus
in African. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study reporting these findings from Africa.
However, these findings' implications on symptomatic or asymptomatic manifestations,
progression to severe disease and case fatality for those affected, and the cross efficacy of vaccines
developed from other settings when applied in Africa are unknown.

Introduction
Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is the etiologic agent for the
so-called Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). COVID-19 first emerged in Hubei Province,
China, in December 2019; the second coronavirus to have arisen from China in the last two
decades1,2. Within months, SARS-CoV-2 spread rapidly both nationally and internationally,
resulting in global outbreaks of pneumonia-like symptom clusters and death in some cases.
Consequently, the World Health Organization publicly declared COVID-19 a pandemic on 11th
March 2020. Besides SARS-CoV-2, four strains of coronavirus pathogenic to humans are
associated with clinical symptoms, including common cold and pneumonia3. Two other
coronaviruses, SARS-CoV (responsible for the Severe acute respiratory syndrome – SARS) and
MERS (which causes the Middle Eastern respiratory syndrome) were notable for causing
infections with higher fatalities deaths4,5. However, outbreaks caused by SARS-CoV and MERS
(though still circulating) were relatively limited compared to those caused by SARS-CoV-26.
The Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is a novel beta
coronavirus (family Coronaviridae, genus Betacoronavirus, species Severe acute respiratory
syndrome-related coronavirus)1,2. SARS-CoV-2 is an enveloped virus that has a positive sense of
single-stranded viral RNA genome of approximately 30kb7. The SARS-CoV-2 genome consists
of 14 open reading frames (ORFs) preceded by transcriptional regulatory sequences (TRSs), which
form transcriptional units8. The largest transcriptional unit includes the ORF1a and b regions,
which translates into two precursor polyproteins (PP1a and PP1b), that are subsequently cleaved
by viral proteases into functional non-structural proteins (Nsps)8. Other ORFs encodes four main
structural proteins, including surface spike (S) glycoprotein, envelope (E) protein, membrane (M)
protein and nucleocapsid (N) protein (See Fig. 1), each of which has specific functions that dictate
SARS-CoV-2 interactions and biology9–11.
The pathophysiology and virulence of SARS-CoV-2 are heavily reliant on the function of Nsps
and other structural proteins. Specifically, Nsps can prevent host immune response1. For structural
proteins, the E protein is crucial in viral pathogenicity and promotes viral assembly and release2.
The S protein also facilitates viral entry into target cells, having an affinity for the angiotensinconverting enzyme 2 (ACE2) receptor expressed on the surface of cells of the lungs, heart, renal
system2,12. Since the pandemic onset, scientists have contributed over 34,300 genome sequences

to the Global Initiative on Sharing Avian Influenza Data (GISAID) and NCBI GenBank databases
as of May 2020. Of this, Africa has only contributed 224 genome sequences. This is mostly due to
Africa’s reduced scientific research capacity, despite an abundance of expertise. As of 12th May
2020, Africa accounts for about 2% of the global COVID-19 caseload3. This has a massive
implication for the African continent, especially as the continent currently lacks the health care
system capacity to manage a full-blown outbreak effectively.
Currently, there is no known cure for COVID-19, with most pandemic response systems across
the globe not being adequate in curbing the spread of the virus. Hence, there is a need to develop
a vaccine(s) and drug(s), in which research teams across the globe are in a race against time to
develop. However, this process is a multi-step process that relies heavily on specific molecular
and pharmacological data. For insights into the molecular basis of developing vaccines and drugs,
the pool of genome sequences of SARS-CoV-2 from all over the world is currently being mined
and analyzed by researchers. Conversely, many vaccines under development are currently at phase
III of trials, implying that the vaccine development may have commenced before the index case
was reported in some African countries. This, in turn, raises an important question; would the
treatments and vaccines, when available, be useful in Africa?
A previous study showed that residues near some amino acid (Lysine 31, Tyrosine 41, 82-84, and
353-357) in human ACE2 were important for SARS-CoV-2 binding4. To investigate mutations in
the amino acid residues of SARS-CoV-2 circulating in Africa, we analyzed whole-genome
sequences of SARS-CoV-2 from Africa deposited in the GISAID and NCBI GenBank databases.
Because all cases in Africa arose from travel, it became compelling to compare COVID-19
sequences generated from the African continent with strains from COVID-19 hotspots Wuhan,
China, and other countries across the world's different regions. We conducted complete genome
analyses of viruses from Africa and compared them with reference sequences from Wuhan and
other parts of the world using phylogenetic analysis. We also investigated the spike protein's amino
acid sequences and the replicase (NSP12) to identify similarities and differences. This study shows,
for the first time, an in-depth analysis of the SARS-CoV-2 molecular epidemiology in Africa and
will potentially provide insights into the mutations/variations in relevant proteins of viruses
circulating in Africa.

Amino Acid alignment of the surface glycoprotein (spike protein)
All African surface glycoproteins of the SARS-CoV-2 obtained from the NCBI GenBank were
aligned using ClustalW and compared to a reference strain from Wuhan, China. After that, a
consensus sequence was created for the African sequences and a global consensus sequence for all
spike proteins from different geographical regions of the world, respectively. A total of 44 African
surface glycoproteins sequences along with a reference strain that were analyzed are as follow:

Amino acid alignment of the NSP12- Replicase protein
ORF1ab amino acid sequences of SARS-CoV-2 from Africa were downloaded, and 1050 NSP12
sequences were identified. The consensus sequence of the African NSP12 was created and aligned
with the Wuhan reference strain, and identity plot was created with BioEdit. Analysis of the NSP12
also performed with global sequences of the replicase protein, and efforts were made to include
representatives of the protein from the world's six geographical regions. The global consensus was
created from these sequences as was done with the African sequences, and the consensuses were

Genomes phylogenetic analysis
For phylogenetic analyses, complete SARS-CoV-2 genomes (a total of 56 sequences from Africa
and other regions of the world) were obtained from GenBank. Genomes with at least 29kb were
used in the analysis, with bat coronavirus genome used as an outgroup. Phylogenetic tree
construction by the neighbor joining method was performed using MEGA X software, with
bootstrap values of 10005. The percentage of replicate trees in which the associated taxa clustered
together in the bootstrap test (1000 replicates) was indicated next to the branches6. The tree was
drawn to scale, with branch lengths in the same units as those of the evolutionary distances used
to infer the phylogenetic tree. Poisson correction method was used to compute the evolutionary
distances considering the units of the number of amino acid substitutions per site8. All ambiguous
positions were removed for each sequence pair (pairwise deletion option). Evolutionary analyses
were conducted in MEGA X software while multiple alignment was performed using MUSCLE
alignment as implemented in MEGA9,10.
Results
Amino acid alignment of the surface glycoprotein
The amino acid sequence alignment of African surface glycoproteins against the Wuhan reference
strain showed that sequences were almost identical, except for few positions where nonsynonymous substitutions occurred. Thirteen mutations were identified to differ between African
and non-African SARS-CoV-2 spike proteins (See Table 2). 90% of the African spike proteins had
D614G substitution, while 7% had a C677H mutation. L5F and R408I mutations occurred in 2%
of all cases. The remaining mutations nine mutations occurred at a rate of 1%.
Of the identified mutations, the D614G substitution (shown in the amino acid alignment in Figure
2) is the most famous mutation among global SARS-CoV-2 sequences. Analysis of the spike

Phylogenetic analysis of genomes of SARS-CoV-2 from Africa
Phylogenetic analysis of trees based on amino acid sequences of SARS-CoV-2 from different parts
of Africa and global reference strains with bat coronavirus sequence showed that sequences
originating from African countries clustered with each other overall African sequences did not
form a monophyletic cluster as shown in Fig 4. However, there seemed to be multiple strains
across South Africa, which did not all align together. This may likely mean that there were multiple
introductions of SARS-CoV-2 strains from different regions. Furthermore, the DRC and Algeria
also have two different strains, while all other African countries have only one strain. Overall,
there seem to be multiple African clades that demonstrate local transmission within the African
countries.
The number of African SARS- CoV-2 complete genomes found at the time of collecting this data
(May 31st, 2020) was two hundred and thirteen (213). These sequences were selected to be
included in the tree based on the completeness of the genomes.

Discussion
This is one of the first studies from Africa that describes the genomic comparison of SARSCoV-2 viruses circulating in Africa, how they compare with the rest of the world and genomic
evolutionary trends on the continent. Our results show mutations in the spike protein and
replicase proteins of the SARS-CoV-2 virus strains driving the epidemic within countries in
Africa. The predominant mutation (90%) is the D614G substitution in the spike protein, and
this aligns with those described in other settings around the globe. There were, however, foci
of novel mutations, including deletions in the NSP12 protein, which is a target for antiviral
drugs such as Remdesivir across the different countries from the various regions. Also,
phylogenetic analyses show different clades that demonstrate the variability of the strains
across countries in Africa, but these are substantially aligned to circulating strains from the
countries of origin of the index cases of COVID-19 in the respective countries. The finding
that the African SARS-CoV-2 spike proteins were highly identical to those of viruses from
other geographical regions may provide a ray of hope on the cross efficacy of vaccines and
therapeutics from other settings in Africa. However, mutations in critical proteins such as
NSP12 may affect these interventions' efficacy in African settings.
The entry of coronaviruses, including SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2, into host cells is essential
for viral infectivity and pathogenicity1113. SARS-CoV-2 host cell entry is mediated by surface
spike proteins recognizing and binding its human receptor angiotensin-converting enzyme –
hACE2 via its Receptor binding domain (RBD) manner that is dependent on host cell preactivation by host cell proprotein convertase furin7. Therefore, SARS-CoV-2 surface spike
protein may affect the efficiency of viral spread. The majority of African spike proteins have a
D614G substitution, as shown in the amino acid's alignment. The D614G substitution was also
identified to be predominant in Asian and European SARS-CoV-2 sequences14.
D614G substitution is a missense mutation (Aspartic acid (D) to Glycine (G) substitution),
which predominantly emerged as a clade in Europe that eventually spread globally15,16. D614G

be relatively conserved, with potential effects on S protein interactions and functions17. The
biological and clinical relevance of this mutation is linked to the type of amino acid and
subsequent protein changes that arise. Studies using (in silico) structural bioinformatics to
assess the effect of D614G mutation on SARS-CoV-2 virulence and epidemiology suggests
that this mutation may be neutral to protein function16. Based on the structure of SARS-CoV2 Spike protein (S) determined by Wrapp et al, using cryo-EM and 3-D modelling of the Sprotein structure by Isabel et al, it was uncovered that this mutation leads to loss of four interchain destabilizing (hydrophobic-hydrophilic) contacts at a position relatively distal from the
RBD with overall null effects on ACE2 and S protein interaction dynamics16,17. However,
Yurkovetsky and colleagues showed that the D614G substitution, which is present in >97%
of SARS-CoV-2 genomes globally, disrupts contact between S1 and S2 domains of the spike
protein and significantly causes conformation shift18. Even though this mutation may have
increased infectivity of SARS-CoV-2, it does not alter spike protein interactions, including
with monoclonal antibodies targeting the S protein18.
The increase in the prevalence of D614G mutation across different geographical regions, as
shown by Korber et al., maybe because this clade has a fitness advantage19. This variant of the
SARS-CoV-2 virus was shown to grow to higher titers as pseudotyped virions, infect a broad
range of human cell types such as lungs, liver and kidney and potentially have higher upper
respiratory tract viral loads19–21.
The presence of multiple mutations, with the D614G mutation is the most predominant may be
important for future studies. Specifically, the D614G substitution could potentially act as an
anchor point for divergent S protein mutations especially within the African continent.
Currently, efforts are geared toward the formulation of vaccines to combat the global scourge
of the coronavirus pandemic. The target of the vaccines is the spike protein, which plays a
central role in the viral entry into the host. The implications of the observed D614G mutation
on the coverage of any vaccine that will be produced against the virus is not known. However,
Ozono and Colleagues22, Hu and colleagues23 and Alexeev and Alekseyev24 several studies
reported that antibodies generated due to natural infections of the two variants D614 or G614
showed cross neutralization re-activities thus indicating that the locus might not be within the
epitope recognized by the host immune system and therefore not critical for humoral mediated
immunity. As the D614G mutation does not prevent cross re-activities of antibodies generated

against the variants, it is therefore very unlikely to interfere with the efficacy of any vaccine

that will be eventually formulated. Therefore, we are of the courteous optimism that whichever
vaccine that is finally approved will be beneficial to the African continent as the observed
amino acid substitution is common to majority of the virus circulating in the different regions
of the world apart from those from Wuhan, China.
The polymerization of SARS-CoV-2 depends on the main polymerase, the RNA-dependent
RNA polymerase (RdRp, also named nsp12). Nsp12 is a 932-residue long enzyme which
consists of two conserved domains, the nidovirus RdRp-associated nucleotidyltransferase
(NiRAN) and the polymerase domains25. Using cryo-EM, Gao and colleagues determined the
structure of SARS-CoV-2 Nsp12 bound to Nsp7 and Nsp8 which act as co-factors26. Upon
comparison of sequences, SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 sequences were found to be highly
identical, including in their interactions with Nsps 7 and 825,27. The finding of an amino acid
deletion at position P314 (interface region of the enzyme) in both African and global
consensuses compared to Wuhan consensus sequence may have significant effect on the
interaction between nsp12 and Nsps 8 and 9. The implications of this deletion on viral fitness
and its replicative capacity are not yet fully understood and therefore more work needs to be
done especially to validate this deletion and how it affects viral fitness. Apart from the deletion
in the NSP12, no substitution was observed. This has scientific validity as substantial
substitutions in an enzymatic protein would have interfered with viral fitness and its replicative
capacity.
Some Nsps have been the subject of clinical research into SARS-CoV-2 therapeutics. For
instance, Remdesivir (GS-5734) is a nucleotide prodrug, a 1’ cyano-substituted adenosine
analogue which

has been shown to have broad antiviral activity including against

coronaviruses MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV, by inhibiting CoV genome replication28–30.
Specifically, NSP12 is a major target for the antiviral drug Remdesivir which plays a critical
role in the replication of coronavirus genome. A mutation in the NSP12 of African SARSCoV-2 genome may have critical ramifications for the ability of Africans to use drugs like
Remdesivir and any NSP12 targeting drugs.
Genomes of viruses undergo evolution over time24. Our results showed that sequences
originating from African countries clustered with each other, but overall African sequences did
not form a monophyletic cluster. This lack of a monophyletic cluster may be because the
analyzed sequences from the different African country were introduced from other countries.
The fact that the genomes formed clades shows and suggests that at this time, there has been

divergence of the SARS-CoV-2 from the continent to form new clades. This suggests that there
may be multiple strains of SARS-CoV-2 virus circulating in the Africa continent. Further
prospective studies are needed to monitor the evolution of the virus overtime both within the
continent and globally.
As with all studies, this study has strengths and weaknesses. This study's main strength is
widespread the target African countries, cutting across all African continent (East, west, north,
south and central). Secondly, this study focusses on a previously unstudied part of the world,
as other studies have excluded analyzing the SARS-CoV-2 genomes in Africa. Finally, this
study draws on available real-time data that continues to evolve and is a reasonable
representation of the landscape at this time. On the other hand, the limitations include the low
number of complete genomes sequenced and deposited as at that time. Research labs within
the African continent seemed to be slow in gathering sequencing data in the initial months of
the outbreak in Africa, which resulted in a relatively small number of complete genomes.
Additionally, we cannot control for errors, lab-specific bias, handling bias, and sample
collection bias because we are working with existing data collected by multiple labs. These
limitations reduce the power of our results and inference. Finally, the findings in this study
need to be validated using wet lab-based experiments.
Conclusion
We conclude that the SARS-CoV-2 virus has shown genomic variability across countries in
Africa, but most of the mutations that resulted in this variability align with those described in
other countries of the world, including the index case in China. However, because these
clades/strains are shown to predominantly cluster with strains from other continents,
therapeutics (vaccines and drugs) designed based on SARS-CoV-2 strains in these continents
could potentially be useful in Africa. However, the finding of novel mutations, though on a
limited scale, may perhaps have implications on the manifestation, progression, severity and
mortality of the infection with the virus. Our findings also call for region-specific testing of
potential vaccines to ensure vaccines' efficacy developed in other settings when used in Africa.
