ABSTRACT
The novel SARS-coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) poses a global challenge on
healthcare and society. For understanding the susceptibility for SARS-CoV-2
infection, the cell type-specific expression of the host cell surface receptor is
necessary. The key protein suggested to be involved in host cell entry is Angiotensin
I converting enzyme 2 (ACE2). Here, we report the expression pattern of ACE2
across >150 different cell types corresponding to all major human tissues and organs
based on stringent immunohistochemical analysis. The results were compared with
several datasets both on the mRNA and protein level. ACE2 expression was mainly
observed in enterocytes, renal tubules, gallbladder, cardiomyocytes, male
reproductive cells, placental trophoblasts, ductal cells, eye and vasculature. In the
respiratory system, the expression was limited, with no or only low expression in a
subset of cells in a few individuals, observed by one antibody only. Our data
constitutes an important resource for further studies on SARS-CoV-2 host cell entry,
in order to understand the biology of the disease and to aid in the development of
effective treatments to the viral infection.

INTRODUCTION
Coronaviruses are enveloped RNA virions, and several family members of
Coronaviridae belong to the most prevalent causes of common cold. Two previous
coronaviruses that were transmitted from animals to humans have caused severe
disease; the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) and the
Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV). The novel coronavirus
SARS-coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), which shares ~80% amino acid identity with
SARS-CoV, is the agent of the coronavirus disease 19 (COVID-19), the new rapidly
spreading pandemic.

When coronaviruses enter the target cell, a surface unit of the spike (S) glycoprotein
binds to a cellular receptor. Upon entry, cellular proteases cleave the S protein which
leads to fusion of the viral and cellular membranes. SARS-Cov has previously been
shown to enter the cell via the ACE2 receptor, primed by the cellular serine protease
TMPRSS2 (Li et al, 2005; Matsuyama et al, 2010). Recent studies suggest that also
SARS-CoV-2 employs ACE2 and cellular proteases for host cell entry, including
TMPRSS2, CTSB and CTSL (Hoffmann et al, 2020), and that the affinity between
ACE2 and the SARS-CoV-2 S protein interaction is high enough for human
transmission (Shang et al, 2020).

For a full understanding of the susceptibility for SARS-CoV-2 infection and the role of
ACE2 in clinical manifestations of the disease, it is necessary to study the cell type1

specific expression of ACE2 in human tissues, both on the mRNA and protein level.
The respiratory system is of special interest due to its high susceptibility to inhaled
viruses, and most viruses infecting humans use different airway epithelial cells for
replication. Given the fact that Covid-19 leads to severe respiratory symptoms, indepth characterization of both the upper and lower respiratory tract is of high priority.
Expression of ACE2 in the lung or upper respiratory epithelia would suggest that
these cells can serve as a reservoir for viral invasion and facilitate SARS-CoV-2
replication. It is however important to study other tissue locations expressing ACE2
that could serve as potential points for host entry, or explain the systemic clinical
processes related to severe disease progression in infected individuals.
ACE2 is a carboxypeptidase negatively regulating the renin-angiotensin system
(RAS), which can induce vasodilation by cleaving angiotensin II. The protein was
identified in 2000 as a homolog to ACE (Tipnis et al, 2000) and due to the
importance of ACE in cardiovascular disease, and the use of ACE inhibitors for
treatment of high blood pressure and heart failure, there has been a large interest in
understanding the function and expression of ACE2 in various human organs. Early
studies based on multi-tissue Northern blotting and QRT-PCR have suggested
moderate to high transcript expression of ACE2 in kidney, testis, heart and the
intestinal tract, while the expression was low or absent in lung (Harmer et al, 2002;
Tipnis et al., 2000). More recently, several large-scale transcriptomics efforts based
on next-generation sequencing allow for quantitative assessment across all major
human tissue types (Keen & Moore, 2015; Uhlen et al, 2015; Yu et al, 2015).
Complementing these datasets with single-cell RNA-seq (scRNA-seq) provides an
excellent tool in studies of transcript levels expected to be found in smaller subsets of
cells in complex tissue samples. Several recent studies using scRNA-seq identified
ACE2 expression in specific cell types, both in the respiratory system and other
organs (Lukassen et al, 2020; Muus, 2020; Sungnak et al, 2020). The spatial
localization of ACE2 on the protein level across the entire human body is however
still poorly understood, and necessary for determining how the expression on the
mRNA level can be translated to physiological and functional phenotypes.
In the present investigation, we performed a large-scale stringent
immunohistochemical analysis based on two independent antibodies, and provide a
comprehensive summary of ACE2 in situ protein expression levels in >150 different
cell types corresponding to 45 different human tissues. The analysis included an indepth characterization of human airways using large sections of nasal mucosa and
bronchus, as well as an extended patient cohort of 360 normal lung samples. The
results were compared with transcriptomics, scRNA-seq, Western blot and mass
spectrometry data, in order to provide a comprehensive overview of ACE2
expression across all major human tissues and organs at different levels.

Transcriptomic profiling of ACE2
For understanding human physiology and disease, it is necessary to quantify the
expression of all protein-coding genes across different organs, tissues and cell types,
and study the expression in a tissue-restricted manner. Several recent large-scale
transcriptomics efforts provide a framework for defining the molecular constituents of
the human body. Three such body-wide initiatives include the Human Protein Atlas
(HPA) consortium (Uhlen et al., 2015) and the genome-based tissue expression
(GTEx) consortium (Keen & Moore, 2015) based on RNA-seq, and the FANTOM5
consortium (Yu et al., 2015) based on cap analysis gene expression (CAGE). The
HPA consortium aims at characterizing the entire human proteome in tissues,
organs, cells and organelles using a combination of transcriptomics and antibodybased proteomics. In the open-access database www.proteinatlas.org, expression
profiles based on both external and internal datasets are shown, together with
primary data, criteria used for validation and original high-resolution images of
immunohistochemically stained human tissue samples. The HPA displays mRNA
expression data from HPA, GTEx and FANTOM5, and also summarizes the three
datasets as normalized expression levels (NX) across 61 tissues, organs and blood
cell types (Uhlen et al, 2016b; Uhlen et al, 2019). Figure 1 shows an overview of
ACE2 expression based on transcriptomics. The analysis covers all major parts of
the human body, corresponding to 16 different organ systems, including blood
(Figure 1a). Based on the consensus of the three datasets and NX=1.0 as detection
limit, expression above the cut-off was observed in 20 different tissue types (Figure
1b). The highest expression was observed in the intestinal tract, followed by kidney,
testis, gallbladder and heart. A few tissues showed a lower expression of <5 NX, e.g.
thyroid gland and adipose tissue, while several organs had an expression level just
above or below cut-off, including liver, female reproductive organs and lung, with
some variations between the three different datasets. Brain, lymphoid tissues, skin,
smooth muscle and immune cells showed a consistent lack of expression.

Single-cell transcriptomic profiling of ACE2
In order to study the role of ACE2 in human tissues, it is necessary to analyze the
expression at a cell type-specific level, since smaller subsets of cells may express
the receptor that may be below detection limit when mixed with all other cells in a
complex tissue sample. Single-cell RNA-seq (scRNA-seq) constitutes an excellent
tool in studies of transcript levels expected to be found in smaller subsets of cells in
complex tissue samples. The largest initiative aiming to create a comprehensive map
of human organs based on scRNA-seq is the Human Cell Atlas consortium, which
coordinates efforts from >1,000 different institutes across >70 countries (Regev et al,
2017).
Recently, several datasets presenting the expression of ACE2 in different human
tissue types, including the respiratory system, have been described. In the present
investigation, nine publicly available scRNA-seq datasets from ileum (Wang et al,

2020b), kidney (Liao et al, 2020), testis (Guo et al, 2018), lung (Han et al, 2020;
Reyfman et al, 2019; Viera Braga, 2019), bronchus (Lukassen et al., 2020; Viera
Braga, 2019) and nasal mucosa (Viera Braga, 2019) were re-analyzed (Figure 2).
The results were largely consistent with the transcriptomics datasets from HPA,
GTEx and FANTOM5, confirming high expression levels in >60% of ileal enterocytes
and >6% of renal proximal tubules. In testis, >3% of Leydig/Sertoli cells and
peritubular cells showed a high expression of ACE2. The percentage of testis cells
expressing ACE2 could however be biased due to underrepresentation of Sertoli
cells in the original study (Guo et al., 2018).
The analysis of human lung from three different datasets suggested an enrichment in
alveolar cells type 2 (AT2), although it should be noted that expression was identified
only in a very small fraction of the AT2 cells (<1%), which is in line with other recent
studies (Zhao, 2020; Zou et al, 2020). Low expression was also observed in 2-3%
and 7% of the cells in bronchus and nasal mucosa, respectively, with the highest
expression observed in ciliated cells and goblet cells.

Protein profiling of ACE2 based on immunohistochemistry
Several recent studies and datasets both on whole tissue transcriptomics and
scRNA-seq have provided careful evaluation of ACE2 expression patterns on the
mRNA level. For a complete understanding of the role of ACE2 in health and
disease, validation on the protein level is however necessary, as the exact
localization of proteins is tightly linked to protein function. Complementing the
transcriptomics datasets with imaging-based proteomics allows studying proteins at
their native locations in intact tissue samples. The standard method for visualizing
proteins is antibody-based proteomics using immunohistochemistry, which not only
gives the possibility to define protein localization in different compartments at a
single-cell and subcellular level but also provides important spatial information in the
context of neighboring cells.
Standardized immunohistochemistry using two independent antibodies towards
ACE2 was performed on TMAs containing up to 22 unique patient samples per tissue
type from 44 different human tissues and organs (Table EV1), as well as a large
section of human eye. ACE2 immunoreactivity was manually quantified in 159
different cell types, out of which 28 were positive using MAB933 (R&D Systems), and
32 were positive using HPA000288 (Atlas Antibodies). Protein expression data for all
cell types using both antibodies are summarized in Table EV2. Figure 3-4 show an
overview of ACE expression patterns as well as representative immunohistochemical
images for organs where at least one tissue sample showed staining with at least
one antibody. The results are well in line with mRNA datasets from both whole tissue
transcriptomics and scRNA-seq. ACE2 immunoreactivity was observed in the
intestinal tract, most abundant in duodenum and small intestine, with lower levels in
stomach and large intestine. Consistent with high mRNA levels, distinct expression

was also found in kidney, gallbladder and testis. The expression in heart differed
between the antibodies, with HPA000288 showing more prominent expression in
cardiomyocytes. Several organs with lower mRNA levels, such as thyroid gland,
epididymis, seminal vesicle, pancreas, liver, and placenta showed positivity in
smaller subsets of cells. High expression was also found in conjunctiva and cornea
of the eye. Interestingly, small capillaries were consistently stained by both
antibodies only in a few organs, including heart, pancreas, thyroid gland, parathyroid
gland and adrenal gland. Staining of ciliated cells in fallopian tube was only found for
HPA000288. Samples corresponding to the same tissue types mostly showed similar
expression patterns with low inter-individual variation, except for bronchus and nasal
mucosa, where only one sample each out of six or eight analyzed TMA samples,
respectively, showed positivity in a subset of ciliated cells for HPA000288. No
immunoreactivity was observed in bronchus or nasal mucosa samples for MAB933,
and none of the antibodies showed positivity in any of the lung samples. This is
inconsistent with recent findings based on scRNA-seq suggesting low expression
levels of ACE2 in specific cell types of lung and respiratory epithelia.
Despite mRNA expression levels above 1.0 NX, no confident expression on the
protein level could be confirmed in adipose tissue, breast, ovary, esophagus or
salivary gland. All other tissues with very low or absent expression based on
transcriptomics were consistently negative also on the protein level, including brain,
lymphoid tissues, skin, smooth muscle and immune cells (Figure EV1).

Immunohistochemical analysis of ACE2 in the upper and lower respiratory
tract
Given the importance of the respiratory system for further understanding of SARSCoV-2 infection and the fact that expression in these tissues not confidently could be
confirmed on the protein level, we decided to perform an in-depth characterization of
both the upper and lower respiratory tract in order to determine if rare expression had
been missed in the initial analysis. An extended immunohistochemical analysis was
performed for both antibodies on eight large sections of bronchus, 12 large sections
of nasal mucosa, as well as a TMA cohort comprising histologically normal lung
samples from 360 individuals (Table EV3). The results for bronchus and nasal
mucosa were consistent with the initial TMA analysis, with cilia staining for the
HPA000288 antibody only in a subset of cells in a few individuals, more abundant in
nasal mucosa compared to bronchus (Figure 5, Table 1). In the lung cohort, only two
individuals showed positivity for the HPA000288 antibody in structures most likely
representing type II pneumocytes, while all other samples were negative (Figure 5,
Table 1). The MAB933 antibody showed ACE2 expression of type II pneumocytes in
one lung individual only, while all other samples of both the upper and lower
respiratory tract were negative.

Protein profiling of ACE2 based on Western blot and mass spectrometry
While immunohistochemistry has the advantage of determining spatial localization of
proteins, the method is only semi-quantitative. Another method for determining
protein levels in a tissue sample is mass spectrometry. Based on publicly available
mass spectrometry datasets and protein abundance data obtained from PaxDB,
ACE2 seemed to be most abundant in kidney and testis, followed by gallbladder,
liver and heart (Figure 6a). No expression was observed in nasal mucosa, lung, oral
mucosa or esophagus. Similar results were obtained with data from ProteomicsDB
(Figure 6b), which underlined a high expression of ACE2 in kidney, rectum, ileum
and testis, but no data was available for lung or upper airways. PaxDB and
ProteomicsDB both take into consideration the large-scale studies based on mass
spectrometry of different normal human tissues published in 2014 (Kim et al, 2014;
Wilhelm et al, 2014). Data from these studies generally correlated well with mRNA
expression levels from HPA, GTEx and FANTOM5, with higher expression observed
in e.g. kidney and testis, and no expression in lung. Since methods used in these
studies were untargeted it cannot be ruled out that ACE2 was expressed at lower
levels in lung.
In order to determine the specificity of the ACE2 antibodies used for
immunohistochemistry with another method, both antibodies were analyzed with
Western blot, using lysates from lung (one male and one female), kidney, colon and
tonsil (Figure 6c). Both antibodies showed a strong band corresponding to 100-130
kDa in kidney. A weaker band of slightly lower size was seen for MAB933 in colon,
while no bands were detected in lung or tonsil for any of the antibodies.

DISCUSSION
ACE2 is suggested to be the key protein involved in SARS-CoV-2 host cell entry.
Here, we have investigated the overall expression profile of ACE2 using multiple
technologies, to gain insights into the importance of this protein for the development
of treatments and vaccines to combat COVID-19 and related diseases. Using an
integrated omics approach, we here analyzed the spatial localization of ACE2 on the
protein level in >150 different cell types corresponding to all major human tissues
and organs, and compared the expression profiles with multiple transcriptomics
datasets.
In order to achieve the best estimate of protein expression across tissues and cells,
stringent antibody validation strategies are needed. The International working group
for antibody validation (IWGAV) formed with representatives from several major
academic institutions (Uhlen et al, 2016a) has proposed five different pillars to be
used for antibody validation to ensure reproducibility of antibody-based studies and
promote stringent strategies for validation. To ensure that an antibody binds to the
intended protein target, the validation must be performed in an application-specific
manner, using at least one of the strategies suggested by IWGAV (Edfors et al,

2018). For immunohistochemistry, two different strategies for antibody validation can
be used: orthogonal strategy, based on comparison of protein expression levels
using an antibody-independent method analyzing the expression levels of the same
target across tissues expressing the target protein at different levels (1); or
independent antibody strategy, defined as a similar expression pattern observed by
an independent antibody targeting the same protein (2). In the present investigation,
both antibodies used for ACE2 immunohistochemistry passed validation criteria
suggested by IWGAV. The overall protein expression patterns showed a high
correlation with mRNA expression levels from three different datasets (HPA, GTEx
and FANTOM5), thereby validating the antibodies using an orthogonal method.
Protein expression levels based on immunohistochemistry were also highly
consistent with tissue levels observed by mass spectrometry-based proteomics. In
addition, the protein expression patterns were in general similar between the two
different antibodies that were raised towards partly overlapping epitopes.
We could confidently present the cell type-specific localization of ACE2 across
several tissues with consistent high expression levels both on the mRNA and protein
level, including the intestinal tract, kidney, gallbladder, heart and testis. Several
recent studies suggest COVID-19 related symptoms in organs expression high levels
of ACE2, including gastro-intestinal symptoms (Guan et al, 2020), renal failure
(Cheng, 2020; Wang et al, 2020a), cardiac injury (Huang et al, 2020; Hui, 2020;
Zheng et al, 2020) and effects on male gonadal function (Ma, 2020). SARS-CoV-2
has also been detected in stool (Xu, 2020), urine (Peng et al, 2020) and semen (Li et
al, 2020) samples. Recently, it was shown that the virus can productively infect
human gut enterocytes, highlighting the need to further study virus shedding in the
gastrointestinal tract and the possibility of fecal-oral transmission. While the
transcriptomics datasets from HPA, GTEx and FANTOM5 did not include whole
samples of human eye, both antibodies showed distinct ACE2 expression in
superficial layers of cornea and conjunctiva. Interestingly, ex-vivo cultures of human
conjunctiva have shown high tropism for SARS-CoV-2, and a recent study also
suggested transcript expression of ACE2 in corneal epithelium (Hui et al, 2020; Sun,
2020).
The use of strict IWGAV recommendations has major advantages in confirming
expression patterns that consistently show a high level of expression based on
orthogonal methods and more than one antibody. It is also useful for confidently
identifying tissues that are expected to lack expression and can serve as negative
controls. In the present investigation, no dataset showed ACE2 expression in the
brain, lymphoid tissues, skin, smooth muscle and immune cells. However, it is
important to point out that identification of mRNA transcripts or proteins expressed at
very low levels can be inconclusive. Several organs that based on transcriptomics
showed low ACE2 mRNA levels were here found to be positive in smaller structures
in the immunohistochemical analysis. Such structures include subsets of epithelial
cells in epididymis or seminal vesicle, or capillaries that correspond to a small
fraction of the total amount of cells in a certain sample. Such staining patterns that

are represented by both antibodies are highly interesting for further studies. In this
context, it is worth noting that expression of ACE2 has recently been described in the
vasculature, suggesting a high expression of ACE2 in microvascular pericytes. One
could speculate that the expression in the vasculature in heart or other organs may
explain clinical manifestations of the SARS-CoV-2, such as hyperinflammation,
coagulation, vascular dysfunction and troponin leakage, resulting in a higher risk of
thromboembolism and critically ill conditions (Chen et al, 2020a; He, 2020; Muus,
2020). Further colocalization studies using high-resolution microscopy are needed in
order to confirm if the vascular expression identified here is in fact endothelial cells or
pericytes, but the consistent expression in smaller capillaries of several organs,
especially in heart and the endocrine system, highlights the importance to explore
the role of the vasculature in SARS-CoV-2 infection. Both antibodies also showed
distinct expression in placental trophoblasts, most prominent with one of the
antibodies. The high ACE2 protein expression in syncytiotrophoblasts is consistent
with recent studies on SARS-CoV-2 invasion of human placenta, where the virus was
localized predominantly to syncytiotrophoblasts (Hosier, 2020). This highlights the
importance to further explore the possibility of transmission of SARS-CoV-2 from
mother to fetus.
The original report of ACE2 protein expression showed positivity in most tissue and
cell types examined, including AT2 cells (Hamming et al, 2004). However, only one
antibody was used in this study and the antibody showed strong staining in several
organs that lack mRNA expression according to the data from HPA, GTEx and
FANTOM5 presented here. The antibody thus does not meet the criteria for
enhanced validation proposed by the International Working Group for Antibody
Validation (IWGAV). Several other studies are also inconclusive. As an example, the
MAB933 antibody from R&D Systems that was used here was in an earlier report
observed in primary cultures of human airway epithelia (Jia et al, 2005), while a more
recent study on many individuals using the same antibody found very limited
expression in the respiratory system (Aguiar, 2020). The latter study confirms the
results shown in the present investigation using this antibody. Other studies showed
different results between antibodies, or did not study the protein expression across
many individuals in comparison with levels observed in other tissues (Lee, 2020;
Muus, 2020).
While the two antibodies used in the present study showed consistent staining
patterns in most tissues and cell types, only one antibody showed positivity in ciliated
cells of fallopian tube and respiratory epithelium. Several recent studies based on
scRNA-seq analysis of the respiratory system point at highest expression in ciliated
cells, suggesting that these cells could serve as a main route of infection for SARSCoV-2 (Muus, 2020; Sungnak et al., 2020). This is underpinned by the fact that
swabs from the throat and nose often contain high levels of SARS-CoV-2. Novel data
from experimental infection of human bronchial epithelial cells (HBECs) also
highlights ciliated cells as the major target of infection (Ravindra, 2020). The staining
in ciliated cells observed by one antibody in the present investigation was mainly

localized to ciliary rootlets in a subset of cells in nasal mucosa and bronchus, in a
few individuals only. Based on scRNA-seq of human lung, low ACE2 expression is
mainly found in a small subset of AT2 cells, often in <1% of the cells. Here, ACE2
positivity in a few cells, most likely representing AT2 cells, was observed in two
samples of a patient cohort consisting of normal lung parenchyma from 360 patients,
while all other individuals were completely negative.
ACE2 protein expression based on other methods for protein detection, such as
mass spectrometry and Western blot, were mainly consistent with the
immunohistochemistry-based analysis. It should however be noted that these
methods represent low-sensitivity approaches not well suited in the search for low
abundant proteins. Antibody-based proteomics using immunohistochemistry has the
advantage of spatial localization of proteins in the context of neighboring cells and is
therefore useful for the detection of staining patterns observed only in small subsets
of cells. The method however requires careful optimization, as even specific
antibodies that have been shown to target the correct protein may generate
additional unspecific off-target binding depending on antigen retrieval method,
dilution or detection method (O'Hurley et al, 2014). While immunohistochemistry is a
comparably more sensitive approach than mass spectrometry and Western blot, it
may however fail to show expression of proteins detected at very low levels, as they
may fall under detection limit. Immunohistochemistry on formalin-fixed tissue
samples involves cross-linking that may mask access of the antibody to certain
epitopes, or antibody binding may be hindered by glycosylation. In the present
investigation, two antibodies both targeting the extracellular domain of ACE2 were
used for immunohistochemical analysis, and only one of the antibodies showed
positivity in ciliated cells. Further studies using other antibodies with non-overlapping
epitopes, including antibodies targeting the cytoplasmic domain are needed to
confirm these findings.
Analysis of ACE2 mRNA transcripts based on spatial transcriptomics or in situ
hybridization would also add important information on ACE2 expression in a tissue
context, that can be compared with results from antibody-based proteomics. Since
transcript levels largely can be considered as a proxy for protein expression levels,
transcriptomics analyses constitute attractive approaches for quantitative
measurements across different tissues and cell types. High-throughput mRNA
sequencing based on RNAseq of whole tissue samples is a robust and sensitive
method that has low technical variation, thereby valuable for comparisons between
organs and identification of genes elevated in certain organs. Bulk RNA-seq however
reflects the average gene expression across thousands of cells in complex tissue
samples, making the method less suitable for answering questions on cell-to-cell
variations in gene expression levels. By the introduction of scRNA-seq, another level
of specificity is added, revolutionizing transcriptomics studies allowing for dissecting
gene expression at single-cell resolution. This new method however leads to noisier
and more variable data compared to bulk RNA-seq (Chen et al, 2019). Technical
limitations related to the different techniques used for tissue dissociation result in a

lower amount of starting material for sequencing. The proportions of different cell
types analyzed within a tissue may be biased and not reflect the true biological
proportions, due to some cell types being less tolerant for dissociation. It may also
lead to the “drop out” phenomenon, where a gene showing high expression levels in
a certain cell lacks expression in other cells corresponding to the same cell type
(Haque et al, 2017). Other limitations include challenges related to interpretation and
analysis of the complex datasets, involving quality control for removing low-quality
scRNA-seq data, normalization and manual annotation of cell clusters. It is also
important to note that scRNA-seq data generated by different methods or platforms
may lead to batch effects. To be able to compare expression data based on scRNAseq datasets from different sources across diverse cell and tissue types in a
consistent way, the global Human Cell Atlas effort promotes standardization of
methods and strategies used for both scRNA-seq protocols and data analysis (Ding
et al, 2020; Mereu, 2020). Further advances in this emerging field are likely to lead to
more refined maps on the single cell transcriptomes of different human tissues and
organs in health and disease. As various methods for mRNA and protein detection
have different advantages and disadvantages, an integrated omics approach
combining data across different platforms is necessary in order to obtain a complete
overview of ACE2 expression across the human body.
Here, we observed none or only very low levels of ACE2 protein in normal respiratory
system. Further studies are needed to investigate if the very limited staining shown in
ciliated cells and AT2 cells represents a true expression of ACE2 and whether this
would be enough for SARS-CoV-2 host cell entry. It also remains to be elucidated if
alternate receptors may be involved to facilitate the initial infection as has been
suggested by a few other groups (Ibrahim et al, 2020; Wang, 2020), or the
possibilities that SARS-CoV-2 enters the host via non-receptor dependent infection.
It should also be noted that the prerequisites of the interplay between SARS-CoV-2
attachment pattern to human cell surface receptors and COVID-19 disease
progression are multifactorial, including not only the binding of the virus to the target
cells but also other factors such as the host’s immune system and the total virus
load. It has been suggested that the initial host immune response to SARS-CoV-2
may trigger an interferon-driven upregulation of ACE2, leading to an increase in the
number of cells in respiratory epithelia susceptible for SARS-CoV-2 infection, which
could potentially explain the possibility of SARS-CoV-2 to enter via ACE2 receptors
in the respiratory tract despite low ACE2 expression under normal conditions (Chua,
2020; Ziegler et al, 2020). Upregulation of ACE2 in respiratory epithelia of COVID-19
patients on the protein level has however not yet been shown.
While it is evident that COVID-19 leads to significant respiratory symptoms, the exact
pathophysiological mechanisms of human transmission and infection are still unclear.
Recent clinical descriptions of severe cases point at an inflammatory reaction both
systemically and in the lungs leading to acute respiratory disease syndrome (ARDS)
and in some cases death (Chen et al, 2020b; Huang et al., 2020). It however remains
to be elucidated if the symptoms are driven by local virus infection of the cells in the

respiratory tract or caused by secondary effects. To increase the understanding of
the role of ACE2 in SARS-CoV-2 infection, we here provide an extensive and
comprehensive overview of ACE2 expression across multiple datasets both on the
mRNA and protein level. The results confirm expression of ACE2 in cell types
previously suggested to harbor ACE2, but also adds novel insights into ACE2
expression in tissues and cell types with no previous or only limited evidence of
expression. The data therefore constitutes a resource for further studies on SARSCoV-2 host cell entry with strong evidence that ACE2 expression in the respiratory
tract is limited, with none or low levels of ACE2 expression in lung and respiratory
epithelia. Studies using samples from COVID-19 patients are urgently needed to
confirm the histological colocalization of the virus with ACE2 and other SARS-CoV-2
related proteins to gain a complete understanding of COVID-19 disease progression
and the viral pathogenesis of SARS-CoV-2.

RNA expression data from HPA(Uhlen et al., 2015), GTEx(Keen & Moore, 2015),
FANTOM5(Yu et al., 2015) as well as the normalized RNA expression dataset were
retrieved from the HPA database (http://www.proteinatlas.org). Consensus transcript
expression levels were obtained through a normalization pipeline, as described
previously (Uhlen et al., 2019). Protein levels based on immunohistochemistry
correspond to staining intensity based on manual annotation, as described below.
The lung scRNA-seq data (gene raw counts) were downloaded from the Gene
Expression Omnibus (GEO) (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/) database under the
series numbers: GSE130148 (Viera Braga, 2019), GSE134355 (Han et al., 2020)
(samples: GSM4008628, GSM4008629, GSM4008630, GSM4008631, GSM4008632
and GSM4008633) and GSE122960 (Reyfman et al., 2019) (samples:
GSM3489182, GSM3489185, GSM3489187, GSM3489189, GSM3489191,
GSM3489193, GSM3489195 and GSM3489197). The same applies to testis, kidney
and small intestine datasets, obtained from the following accession numbers: testis
GSE112013 (Guo et al., 2018), kidney GSE131685 (Liao et al., 2020) and small
intestine GSE125970 (Wang et al., 2020b). Other datasets were retrieved from
https://www.covid19cellatlas.org/ (Sungnak et al., 2020) including nasal brushes
(Lukassen et al.) and bronchi (Lukassen et al., 2020; Viera Braga, 2019).
ACE2 mass spectrometry-based expression among different tissues was assessed
by retrieving data in two proteomics databases: Protein abundance database
(PaxDB) (Wang et al, 2015) and ProteomicsDB (Schmidt et al, 2018). ACE2 protein
abundances among different tissues were downloaded from PaxDB, these values
are based on MS publicly available data including large-scale studies of different
normal human tissues (Kim et al., 2014; Wilhelm et al., 2014). In this database,
quantification data from different datasets were processed in order to be unified, and

then, if more than one value was available, integrated by weighted averaging in order
to provide an estimated dataset (Wang et al., 2015). The results, presented in PPM
(part per millions), provides an estimation of protein abundance relative to the other
proteins of the tissue. ProteomicsDB facilitated exploration of protein expression
patterns, comparisons across datasets, and gave an average intensity across the
human body. Protein abundance data for ACE2 were obtained from the expression
tab of ProteomicsDB and presented as a normalized intensity-based absolute
quantification (iBAQ) value.

Analysis of scRNA-seq data
Data analysis including filtering, normalization, and clustering were performed using
Seurat V3.0 (https://satijalab.org/seurat/9) (Butler et al, 2018) in R (CRAN). The
same workflow (including normalization, scaling and clustering of cells) was
performed for each dataset. Cells were removed when they had less than 500 genes
and greater than 20% reads mapped to mitochondrial expression genome. The gene
expression data were normalized using Seurat default settings, and cell clustering
was based on the 5,000 most highly variable genes. All scatter plots were obtained
using the UMAP method. Cluster identity was manually assigned based on wellknown cell type markers and named based on the main cell type in each cluster.
Seurat also allowed an intuitive visualization of ACE2 expression among the cell
types thanks to the DotPlot function.

Human tissues and sample preparation
Human tissues samples for analysis of mRNA and protein expression in the HPA
datasets were collected and handled in accordance with Swedish laws and
regulation. Tissues were obtained from the Clinical Pathology department, Uppsala
University Hospital, Sweden and collected within the Uppsala Biobank organization.
All samples were anonymized for personal identity by following the approval and
advisory report from the Uppsala Ethical Review Board (Ref # 2002-577, 2005-388,
2007-159, 2011-473). The RNA extraction and RNA-seq procedure has been
described previously (Uhlen et al., 2015). For immunohistochemical analysis,
formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded (FFPE) tissue blocks from the pathology archives
were selected based on normal histology using a hematoxylin-eosin stained tissue
section for evaluation. In short, representative 1 mm diameter cores were sampled
from FFPE blocks and assembled into tissue microarrays (TMAs) of normal tissue
samples. Several different arrays were analyzed for each antibody, corresponding to
between four and 22 unique individuals per tissue type (Table EV1). In addition to the
standard TMA analysis, both antibodies were analyzed on large sections from eye,
bronchus and nasal mucosa, as well as an extended cohort comprising 360 normal
lung samples (Table EV3).

Normal lung tissue cores of 1mm in diameter were sampled from FFPE tissue blocks
of 360 patients diagnosed with lung cancer, and assembled into TMAs. Only distant
areas of non-malignant lung parenchyma were sampled. The cohort has been
described previously (Djureinovic et al, 2016), and is based on consecutive patients
with non-small cell lung cancer that underwent surgical resection at Uppsala
University Hospital, Uppsala, Sweden, between the years 2006 and 2010, and
approved by the Uppsala Ethical Review Board (Ref# 2013/040).

Immunohistochemistry

554

Immunohistochemical staining and high-resolution digitization of stained TMA slides
were performed essentially as previously described (Kampf et al, 2012). TMA blocks
were cut in 4 µm sections using a waterfall microtome (Microm H355S,
ThermoFisher Scientific, Freemont, CA), placed on SuperFrost Plus slides
(ThermoFisher Scientific, Freemont, CA), dried overnight at room temperature (RT),
and then baked at 50°C for at least 12 h. Automated immunohistochemistry was
performed by using Lab Vision Autostainer 480S Module (ThermoFisher Scientific,
Freemont, CA), as described in detail previously (Kampf et al., 2012). Primary
antibodies towards human ACE2 were the polyclonal rabbit IgG antibody
HPA000288, RRID: AB_1078160, (Atlas Antibodies AB, Bromma, Sweden) and
monoclonal mouse IgG antibody MAB933, RRID: AB_2223153, (R&D Systems,
Minneapolis, MN). The antibodies were diluted and optimized based on IWGAV
criteria for antibody validation (Uhlen et al., 2016a). Protocol optimization was
performed on a test TMA containing 20 different normal tissues. The stained slides
were digitized with ScanScope AT2 (Leica Aperio, Vista, CA) using a 20x objective.
All tissue samples were manually annotated by two independent observers (FH and
CL) in 159 different cell types. Annotation parameters included staining intensity and
quantity of stained cells, determined using a 4-graded scale based on standardized

with a Precellys 24 (Bertin Instruments, France). Lysates were measured for protein
concentration using a Non-Interfering protein Assay kit (cat#488250, Merck Millipore,
Darmstadt, Germany at 480 nm, and stored in -70ºC.
Based on the protein concentration the lysates were mixed with MilliQ H2O and
3xTCEP sample buffer (9 ul 3xTCEP sample buffer per 21 ul (protein lysate + MilliQ
H2O)). Ingredients for 1 mL 3xTCEP sample buffer were as followed: 0.187 mL 0.5 M
Tris-HCl pH 6.8, 0.436 mL 87% Glycerol, 0.03 mL 1% Bromophenol blue, 0.3 mL
10% SDS, 0.03 mL 0.5 M TCEP pH 7, 0.017 mL MilliQ H2O. The mixed samples
were heated for 5 minutes at 95°C, cooled down, and vortexed before loading to gel
(4-20% Criterion TGX Precast Midi Protein Gel, Bio-Rad Laboratories, USA). Total
amount of protein loaded per well was 15μg. Gel was run in 1x Tris/Glycine/SDS
running buffer (Bio-Rad Laboratories, USA) for 45 minutes at 200V. PageRuler Plus
Prestained Protein Ladder (#26619 ThermoFisher Scientific, Freemont, CA) was
applied with the following molecular sizes: 250, 130, 100, 70, 55, 35, 25, 15, 10 kDa.
For protein transfer a Trans-Blot Turbo Transfer System (Bio-Rad Laboratories,
USA) was used. The gel was placed on a PVDF membrane from a transfer pack
(Bio-Rad Laboratories, USA) and the Trans-Blot Turbo Transfer System was run for
9 minutes at a high molecular weight setting. After the run the membranes were dried
and stored dark for further downstream testing. One membrane per batch was
stained with Ponceau S (Sigma-Aldrich, Darmstadt, Germany) for 5 minutes to
control proper protein transfer. The same membrane was then rinsed and used as
negative control and run in the same manner as the other membranes except for the
primary antibody step. Equilibration of the dry PVDF membrane was done in 95%
EtOH, followed by rinsing with Tris Buffered Saline with Tween 20 (TBST) (0.05%
Tween) and a blocking step with TBST (0.5% Tween 20) + 5% dry milk in for 45 min.
The membranes were incubated with two different primary antibodies towards ACE2:
HPA000288 (Atlas Antibodies AB) and MAB933 (R&D Systems). HRP-conjugated
antibodies were used as secondary antibodies (Swine anti-rabbit 1:3000, Goat antimouse 1:5000, Dako, Glostrup, Denmark). Membranes were developed with Clarity
Western ECL Substrate 1:1 (Bio-Rad Laboratories, USA) and chemiluminescence
signal was detected with a Chemidoc Touch camera (Bio-Rad Laboratories, USA).

Figure 1. ACE2 expression in human tissues based on transcriptomics. (A) Overview of the
tissues and organs analyzed based on transcriptomics by the three independent consortia Human
Protein Atlas (HPA), FANTOM and GTEx. In total, 16 organ systems (with several tissues comprising
an organ system) were used to create a consensus normalized expression (defined as the unit NX)
based on the expression levels of all three datasets. (B) ACE2 gene expression summary in human
tissues in 61 different tissues and cells in NX. Cut-off for what is regarded as expressed was set to 1.0
NX.

Figure 2. ACE2 expression in human tissues based on single-cell transcriptomics.

832

Dot plots summarizing the transcriptomics levels of ACE2 based on different scRNA-seq datasets and
tissues. Three different scales were used, in order to be able to compare percentages of cells
expressing ACE2 both between and within tissue types. The size of the dots indicates the percentage
of cells expressing ACE2 in respective cell type with a maximum of 60% (left column), 10% (middle
column) and 1% (right column), and the color saturation corresponds to the average expression level.
Plots were generated using Seurat package in R.

Figure 4. Cell type-specific localization of ACE2 in human tissues based on
immunohistochemistry. Representative images of 20 tissue types and histological structures stained
on consecutive sections with immunohistochemistry using two antibodies targeting human ACE2
protein (brown), and counterstained with hematoxylin (blue). Most intense antibody staining was
observed in microvilli of the intestinal tract and renal proximal tubules, in membranes of gallbladder
epithelium, epididymis epithelium, testicular Sertoli cells and Leydig cells, a subset of glandular cells
in seminal vesicle and cytoplasm of cardiomyocytes, with HPA000288 also staining the cardiac
muscle fibers, while MAB933 only showed staining in a few cells. Distinct ACE2 staining for both
antibodies was also present in cornea and conjunctiva of the eye, interlobular pancreatic ducts, as
well as in placental villi, both in cytotrophoblasts, syncytiotrophoblasts, and also in extravillous
trophoblasts, while placenta decidua was negative. ACE2 staining could be observed at the base of
ciliated fallopian tube epithelium, however only for one of the antibodies. Note that ACE2 protein
expression was less prominent in the crypts of the mucosal intestinal layer. ACE2 also stained positive
in endothelial cells and pericytes in several tissues, see Fallopian, thyroid, parathyroid, adrenal gland,
pancreas and heart. Scale bar = 50µm. Scale bar in dashed squares = 10 µm. (Brunner = Brunner’s
gland, EVT = extravillous trophoblasts, endo=endothelial cells).

Figure 5. Cell type-specific localization of ACE2 in human respiratory system based on
immunohistochemistry. Representative images of human respiratory tissues, all stained on
consecutive sections, with immunohistochemistry using two antibodies targeting human ACE2 protein
(brown), and counterstained with hematoxylin (blue). Respiratory tissues were composed of different
structures in nasal mucosa, bronchus, smaller bronchioles and lung tissue. ACE2 staining could be
observed at the base of ciliated cells in both nasal mucosa and bronchial epithelium (arrowheads).
Rare ACE2 staining was present in a few alveolar cells (arrows). No staining was observed in nasal
squamous epithelium, bronchioles, or submucosal glands in either tissue. Gender and age are shown
for all individuals. Red and green colored squares mark the positions in the TMA cores shown as
magnifications. Scale bar = 50µm. Scale bar for images in dashed squares = 10 µm. (re=respiratory;
sq=squamous).
