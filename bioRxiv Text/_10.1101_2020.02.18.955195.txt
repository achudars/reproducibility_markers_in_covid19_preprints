Abstract
Porcine epidemic diarrhea virus is an alphacoronavirus responsible for significant morbidity and mortality in pigs. A key
determinant of viral tropism and entry, the PEDV spike protein is a key target for the host antibody response and a good
candidate for a protein-based vaccine immunogen. We used electron microscopy to evaluate the PEDV spike structure, as
well as pig polyclonal antibody responses to viral infection. The structure of the PEDV spike reveals a configuration similar
to that of HuCoV-NL63. Several PEDV protein-protein interfaces are mediated by non-protein components including a
glycan at Asn264 and two bound palmitoleic acid molecules. The polyclonal antibody response to PEDV infection shows a
dominance of epitopes in the S1 region. This structural and immune characterization provides new insights into coronavirus
spike stability determinants and explores the immune landscape of viral spike proteins.
Introduction
Porcine epidemic diarrhea virus is a coronavirus of
the alphacoronavirus genus. Identified as a viral agent
distinct from transmissible gastroenteritis virus (Wood,
1977) and as a coronavirus (Pensaert and de Bouck, 1978),
this virus is responsible for an enteric infection in pigs.
Originally identified in England (Wood, 1977), PEDV is
now a global pathogen. PEDV was first identified in the
United States in 2013 (Stevenson et al., 2013) where it
swept through pig populations causing several million
piglet deaths (Sawyer and Sherwell, 2014). Mortality due to
viral infection varies with age, with mortalities of 1-3 day
old piglets in naïve herds approaching 100% (Lee, 2015).
While mortality due to PEDV infection is lower in older
pigs, infection can still result in decreased growth
performance.
Like all coronaviruses, PEDV possesses a spike
glycoprotein (S) responsible for cell attachment and virushost membrane fusion mediating viral entry into host cells.
Coronavirus spikes are class I viral fusion proteins (Bosch
et al., 2003; Chambers et al., 1990), possessing structural
and functional parallels to influenza hemagglutinin (Wilson
et al., 1981) and HIV-1 Env (Julien et al., 2013; Lyumkis et
al., 2013). This class of proteins proceeds from a metastable
prefusion conformation to a highly stable postfusion
conformation (Bullough et al., 1994). For coronavirus
spikes, this transition of conformations has been proposed
to be triggered by progressive destabilization of the
prefusion structure through receptor binding and host
proteolytic cleavage (Belouzard et al., 2009; Millet and
Whittaker, 2015; Taguchi and Matsuyama, 2002). As the
major surface glycoprotein on the enveloped virions, spikes
are also the target of neutralizing antibodies (Okda et al.,
2017). These antibodies primarily target the PEDV S1
region and some epitopes have been found to be

neutralizing (Li et al., 2017a; Okda et al., 2017; Sun et al.,
2007). However, a structural mapping of PEDV antibody
epitopes targeted during viral infection is lacking.
Coronavirus spikes adopt a shared domain
arrangement where the N-terminal S1 regions of the
homotrimeric spike surround and cap the C-terminal S2
regions. In betacoronavirus spikes, the S1 and S2 regions
are often demarcated by a protease cleavage site (Millet and
Whittaker, 2015). However, this site is lacking in many
alphacoronvirus spikes including PEDV. Coronavirus S1
regions of the spike contain domains contributing to
receptor binding. Receptors include both host glycans and
proteins and vary widely between coronaviruses. PEDV has
been shown to bind to sialic acid glycans using its S1
domain 0 (Li et al., 2016). By analogy with TGEV, PEDV
spikes were also proposed to recognize porcine
aminopeptidase N (pAPN) (Li et al., 2007). However, the
use of pAPN as a receptor for PEDV has been called into
question (Li et al., 2017b).
High-resolution structural studies of coronavirus
spike proteins have the potential to shed light on molecular
mechanisms of spike prefusion stability and the lessons
learned can be utilized in the production of stabilized spike
proteins as vaccine immunogens. Here we used cryoelectron microscopy (cryo-EM) to determine the structure
of the PEDV spike protein at 3.5 Å resolution. This structure
has allowed us to compare our findings with the structure of
the human alphacoronavirus NL63 spike as well as another
recently published PEDV spike structure (Walls et al.,
2016b; Wrapp and McLellan, 2019). We found several
protein-protein interfaces mediated by non-protein
components suggesting roles for these glycans and ligands
in enhanced prefusion spike stability. We also used
negative-stain electron microscopy to illuminate the
recognition of the PEDV spikes by the host polyclonal

the production of prefusion stabilized spikes as vaccine
immunogens.

contrast to the recently published PEDV spike structure
where domain 0 has flipped up and away from the main
portion of the spike (Wrapp and McLellan, 2019)
(Supplementary Fig. 2). Though sequence differences do
exist between this previous PEDV spike structure (strain
CV777)
and
that
presented
here
(strain
USA/Colorado/2013), these differences are small compared
to the sequence differences with HuCoV-NL63 which is
structurally more consistent with the PEDV spike described
here. Indeed, even in our attempts at 3D classification of the
PEDV spike particles, we do not see evidence for this
flipped up conformation of domain 0. To test the previously
proposed hypothesis that the difference in domain 0
conformations may be due to differences in expression
system, we expressed the PEDV spike in both insect and
mammalian cells including expression conditions to
produce high-mannose glycosylation patterns similar to the
methods used for the previous PEDV spike structure
(Wrapp and McLellan, 2019). In all cases, we observe
domain 0 in the beneath-domain A conformation
(Supplementary Table 2 and Supplementary Fig. 2). The
reasons for the altered conformation observed in the
previous PEDV spike structure remain to be determined and

Results
Structural description
Coronavirus spikes are homotrimeric glycoproteins
which can be separated into an N-terminal S1 region
containing the receptor binding regions and a C-terminal S2
region containing the membrane fusion machinery (Fig.
1A). The overall structure of the PEDV spike strongly
resembles that of the human coronavirus NL63 spike (Walls
et al., 2017) (Fig 1B-D, Supplementary Table 1 and
Supplementary Fig. 1). Like the NL63 spike, PEDV spike
contains two structurally homologous S1 N-terminal
domains, domain 0 and domain A. The arrangement of these
S1 N-terminal domains is similar to that of NL63 where
domain A occupies a position at the apex of the spike, distal
to the viral membrane, while domain 0 is positioned beneath
domain A, packing against the side of the spike protein and
contacting both S1 domain D (also called sub-domain 2)
and S2. The observed PEDV domain arrangement is in

Figure 2: Comparison of S2¢ cleavage sites in coronavirus spike structures. S2¢cleavage occurs after a coronavirus
conserved arginine residue. This position is preceded by protein loop and an N-linked glycan which appear to occlude this
cleavage site in the prefusion conformation. Structures used for comparison include spikes from HuCoV-NL63 (5SZS.pdb
(Walls et al., 2016b)), Porcine deltacoronavirus (6BFU.pdb, (Xiong et al., 2018)), MERS-CoV (5W9I.pdb, (Pallesen et al.,
2017)), SARS-CoV (6CRV.pdb, (Kirchdoerfer et al., 2018)) and Infectious bronchitis virus (6CV0.pdb, (Shang et al.,
2018a)).
will require additional experimental studies of
alphacoronavirus spike structure.
Despite superimposing well onto the S2 fusion
subunit and containing a similar overall S1 domain
arrangement, the PEDV spike differs in several regards to
the previously determined NL63 spike structure. Unlike the
NL63 spike, the reconstructed density for domain 0 is more
poorly defined than other domains indicating a higher
degree of motion relative to the rest of the spike.
Superimposition of the coordinate models of NL63 spike
and the PEDV spike presented here reveals that both
domain 0 and domain A have shifted approximately 15 Å
towards the S2 region in the PEDV spike while domain B
(also referred to as the S1 CTD) has remained in
approximately the same position. The three B domains of
the trimer are also more tightly packed around the spike
three-fold axis with domain B making fewer contacts to
domain A than observed in NL63 spike. All three B
domains are in the downwards or lying conformation
similar to that observed for available alpha-, gamma-, and
deltacoronavirus spike structures (Shang et al., 2018a;
Shang et al., 2018b; Walls et al., 2016b) as well as several
betacoronavirus spike structures (Kirchdoerfer et al., 2016;
Tortorici et al., 2019; Walls et al., 2016a).

PEDV spike is known to bind sialic acid and
hemagglutinate red blood cells. This activity has been
attributed to the S1 domain 0 (Hou et al., 2017; Li et al.,
2016). However, comparison of the PEDV S1 domain 0
with the equivalent domain of the recently determined
betacoronavirus OC43 spike in complex with sialic acid
(Tortorici et al., 2019) suggests that the OC43 spike sialic
acid binding site is not shared with PEDV despite structural
homology between the two glycan-binding domains
indicating an altered mode of glycan recognition in PEDV.
In a portion of field isolates and tissue culture adapted
viruses, PEDV S1 domain 0 has been deleted, leading to an
apparent loss of sialic acid binding activity (Diep et al.,
2017; Hou et al., 2017; Masuda et al., 2015). Though
originally suggested to result in viruses with reduced
mortality in piglets (Hou et al., 2017; Masuda et al., 2015),
spike domain 0 deletion viruses have been found to be
capable of causing high mortality (Diep et al., 2017).
Moreover, it has been suggested that the deletion of domain
0 may contribute to viral persistence and reoccurrence of
PEDV on pig farms (Diep et al., 2017). To examine the
effect of this domain deletion on the overall structure of the
PEDV spike, we used negative-stain EM to determine the
structure of the PEDV spike with a 197 amino acid deletion,

removing domain 0 (Diep et al., 2017). This low-resolution
structure displays a similar structure to the full-length spike
indicating that the deletion of this domain does not impart
any macroscopic changes in spike protein conformation
(Supplement Fig. 1).
The S2¢ protease cleavage site in the S2 region of
the spike is conserved across coronavirus spikes (Millet and
Whittaker, 2015) and is believed to only be exposed for
cleavage by host proteases during viral entry (Belouzard et
al., 2009; Park et al., 2016). Examination of the PEDV S2
fusion machinery indicates a high structural homology with
other coronavirus spike proteins including the S2¢ cleavage
site. This S2¢ cleavage site at Arg894 is presented on the
side of the spike following a short loop. The conformation
of this preceding loop along with an upstream glycan at
Asn873, blocks recognition of the S2¢ cleavage site by host
proteases in the prefusion conformation (Fig. 2). A
comparison of available coronavirus spike structures
(Kirchdoerfer et al., 2018; Pallesen et al., 2017; Shang et al.,
2018a; Tortorici et al., 2019; Walls et al., 2016b; Xiong et
al., 2018) shows the positioning and conformation of the
preceding loop (875-893) to be conserved. In addition, the
presence of a glycan 18-22 amino acids N-terminal to the
S2¢ cleavage site also appears to be shared across
coronavirus genera.

S2 central helices. So far unique to PEDV is the additional
coordination of these S2 central helices by the Asn264
glycan (Fig. 3A) suggesting a contributing role for this
glycan in stabilizing the prefusion spike conformation.
Indeed, the sequon coding for this glycan position is 99.8%
conserved across full-length PEDV spike sequences in the
NCBI protein database (Pickett et al., 2012). As our PEDV
spike protein used for high-resolution cryo-EM was
produced in insect cells which possess alternative
glycosylation patterns (Thirstrup et al., 1993), we sampled
the overall conformations of PEDV spikes possessing a
variety of glycosylation patterns by expressing an identical
PEDV spike DNA construct using mammalian HEK-293F,
with kifunensine, and HEK-293S Gnt-/- expression systems
and examining the protein with negative-stain EM
(Supplementary Fig. 1). The low-resolution reconstructions
reveal identical conformations of the PEDV spike despite
the differing glycosylation states, including the lower
positioning of the S1 domain A relative to the S2 region.
We also removed the sequon for the Asn264 glycan by
mutating the Asn to Asp. This mutation strongly reduced
PEDV spike protein expression levels in HEK-293F cells
by approximately 10-fold, consistent with a stabilizing
effect. Nonetheless, this spike protein was still capable of
adopting the pre-fusion conformation (Supplementary Fig.
2) indicating that the presence of the Asn264 glycan is not
strictly required.
The second non-protein density that we observed at
an inter-domain interaction site lies between S1 domain D
(also called sub-domain 2) and the S2 region of an adjacent
protomer (Fig. 3B). The elongated, unbranched appearance
of this density and a close proximity to neighboring Arg842
in S2 led us to model this density as a 16-carbon,
unbranched fatty acid. An identical unmodeled density is
present in the previously determined PEDV spike structure
(Wrapp and McLellan, 2019). We confirmed the presence
of this ligand using mass spectrometry, which indicated the

Sugar and fatty acids mediate protein chain interfaces
In modeling coordinates into the reconstructed EM
density, we observed three non-protein densities at different
domain interfaces. The first of these is a glycan density
emanating from Asn264. This glycan is also present in the
NL63 spike structure previously determined (Walls et al.,
2016b) and occupies a hole observed in coronavirus spikes.
However, due to the lower positioning of the S1 domain A
relative to S2, this glycan in PEDV spike is sandwiched
between the S1 domain A and the S2 region of an adjacent
protomer. In coronavirus spikes, the S1 domain B caps the

presence of a molecule with a molecular weight matching
that of palmitoleic acid (Supplementary Fig. 3). This fatty
acid occupies a hydrophobic pocket formed between
domain D and S2 and has limited surface exposure leading
us to hypothesize that this fatty acid was incorporated
during the folding of the protein domains. Comparison with
published structures of NL63, 229E and Feline infectious
peritonitis spikes shows that despite some amino acid
sequence differences, the hydrophobic fatty acid pocket is
shared between these alphacoronavirus spikes (Li et al.,
2019; Walls et al., 2016b; Yuan et al., 2017). Moreover,
examination of the NL63 spike reconstructed density (Walls
et al., 2016b) reveals unmodeled density of a nearly
identical ligand at this position (Supplementary Fig. 3)
suggesting that the binding of palmitoleic acid to this site
may be shared across alphacoronaviruses. It should be noted
that while the reconstructed densities of 229E and feline
infectious peritonitis virus spikes do contain some
unmodeled density in this region, these smaller densities are
less indicative of a stoichiometrically bound ligand. This
binding pocket for palmitoleic acid is so far a feature only
for available alphacoronavirus spike structures as spike
structures from beta-, gamma- and deltacoronavirus spikes
possess neither an intact hydrophobic pocket between
domain D and S2 nor density for a bound ligand nearby.
While the shared palmitoleic acid binding site between
NL63 and PEDV spikes suggests an important role for this
ligand, the importance of this binding site is enigmatic and
remains to be explored experimentally. One possibility may
be the burial of additional hydrophobic surfaces to stabilize
interactions between S1 and S2.
A third non-protein density was observed in S1
domain A near its contact with the S1 domain C from an
adjacent protomer (Fig. 3C). This density was also modeled
as palmitoleic acid due to its positioning within a
hydrophobic pocket and its unbranched appearance. A
similar unmodeled density is present in the previously
determined PEDV spike, albeit in altered conformation
possibly owing to the different conformation of domains 0
and A in this structure (Wrapp and McLellan, 2019). In
contrast to the palmitoleic acid binding pocket described
above, this hydrophobic pocket is composed entirely of S1
domain A. However, the palmitoleic acid head group faces
the S1 domain C from an adjacent protomer. Neighboring
basic residues on the surface of domain C may provide
favorable electrostatic interactions for the palmitoleic acid
head group. Also, in contrast to the first palmitoleic acid site
described above, density for this second palmitoleic acid is
not present in the previously determined NL63 spike
structure and is so far unique to the PEDV spike.

spike proteins. Fab derived from the IgG of pigs
experimentally infected with PEDV or a negative control
animal was combined with recombinant PEDV spike and
single particle negative-stain electron microscopy was
performed as recently described (Bianchi et al., 2018).
Extensive 3D classification revealed that all three of the sera
from experimentally infected pigs had spike-specific
antibodies that targeted the same two epitopes in S1 (Fig. 4,
Supplementary Table 3 and Supplementary Fig. 4). The first
epitope is located at the spike apex primarily contacting the
membrane distal loops of S1 domain A as well as possibly
contacting select loops of domain B. The second epitope lies
on the side of the PEDV spike bridging S1 domains C and
D. This side epitope of PEDV spike corresponds to the
previously mapped “S1 D” neutralizing epitope, amino
acids 636-789 (Okda et al., 2017; Sun et al., 2007).
Antibodies recognizing this epitope were shown to contain
much of the neutralizing activity of anti-PEDV polyclonal
sera. Interestingly, we did not observe Fabs binding to other
previously identified epitopes including domain 0 or
domain B (Chang et al., 2002; Li et al., 2017a) possibly
owing to a lower prevalence of these antibodies or the
unique truncated immunogens used to originally elicit
antibodies against these epitopes rather than intact trimeric
spikes presented during infection.
Discussion
These structures of the PEDV spike visualized by
electron microscopy present new opportunities for
structural comparisons against the collection of available
coronavirus spike structures as well as indicating unique
features such as glycan and fatty acid ligands mediating
domain interfaces. We also determined the dominant
antibody epitopes on the PEDV spike, one of which
overlaps with a known neutralizing antibody epitope.
Similar to NL63 spike, the PEDV spike domain B
are all in downwards conformations. This is in contrast to
the betacoronavirus spike domain B of SARS- and MERSCoV which adopt upwards conformations to recognize host
protein receptors (Kirchdoerfer et al., 2018; Song et al.,
2018). It has previously been proposed that the PEDV spike
may use porcine APN as a host protein receptor for viral
entry. However, recent evidence suggests APN is not
necessary for PEDV entry into host cells (Li et al., 2017b).
The observed poor accessibility of the PEDV spike domain
B for receptor recognition supports the notion that this
domain may recognize host receptors more poorly than the
domain B of spikes which transition to upwards
conformations more readily.
Spike conformational changes like those induced
by host receptor binding (Walls et al., 2019), initiate the
transition of coronavirus spikes from a pre-fusion to a postfusion state during viral entry. Key to these conformational
transitions is the stability between the S1 and S2 regions of
the viral spike as S1 shedding has been suggested as a

Figure 4: Polyclonal antibody recognition of PEDV spike epitopes. Antibody Fabs from three experimentally PEDV
infected pigs recognize two distinct epitopes. The first epitope (yellow) is at the spike apex and is composed primarily of
S1 domain A. The second epitope (orange) is on the side of the spike protein and is composed of S1 domains C and D and
corresponds to a known neutralizing epitope (Okda et al., 2017; Sun et al., 2007).
prerequisite for this transition (Walls et al., 2017; Yuan et
al., 2017). Our observation of glycan and fatty acid ligands
in S1-S2 interfaces suggests a role for these ligands in
modulating these interfaces and we hypothesize that these
glycan and fatty acid interactions serve to stabilize the viral
spike. These non-protein components add new
considerations to protein engineering efforts to stabilize the
prefusion conformations of alphacoronavirus spikes to take
into account the effect of these non-protein ligands and their
contribution to S1-S2 interactions.
In considering vaccine immunogens, it is also
important to consider those epitopes which are dominantly
recognized by the host immune response. The analysis of
sera from pigs experimentally infected with PEDV revealed
the same two epitopes in all three experimentally infected
pigs studied, demonstrating a remarkably convergent
immune response to infection. The epitope at the junction
of domains C and D is a known neutralizing epitope (Okda
et al., 2017; Sun et al., 2007). Moreover, previous work on
this epitope demonstrated that immunizing with just this
region of the PEDV spike was sufficient to produce sera
with significant protection against viral infection (Sun et al.,
2007). In addition, the paucity of diverse epitopes seen in
the PEDV infected pig sera samples suggests significant
opportunity for the specific presentation of spike protein
regions as vaccine immunogens to explore and exploit novel
epitopes not dominant in natural infection particularly
against the S2 region of the protein.
These analyses of the PEDV spike reveal the
ectodomain protein structure, non-protein ligands
contributing to protein stability and dominant spike

antibody epitopes arising during PEDV infection. Each of
these observations will find future utility in not only
understanding PEDV entry and immune responses, but also
aid in the design of vaccine immunogens across the
alphacoronavirus family.

each of which was separated by room and ventilation system in the same facility. Pigs in each room were confined by pens
on a solid floor that was rinsed daily, fed a balanced diet ad libitum based on weight, and given free access to water.
METHOD DETAILS
Plasmid preparation
The protein sequence of Porcine epidemic diarrhea virus (PEDV) USA/Colorado/2013 spike ectodomain 1-1322
with a C-terminal foldon, TEV site, His-tag and Strep-tag was codon optimized for mammalian expression (Genscript) and
inserted into pFastBac1 (Thermo Fisher, Cat. #10360014) using EcoRI and XbaI restriction sites (Genscript). The insert
was further cloned into pcDNA3.4 using the HiFi DNA Assembly Kit (New England Biolabs) and PCR products (Phusion
polymerase, Thermo Fisher, Cat. #F530L) for spike (PEDV fwd and rvs) and for pcDNA3.4 (pcDNA34 fwd and rvs).
The Asn264Asp in spike-pcDNA3.4 substitution and 34-230 deletion spike (based on genbank sequence
AMK69964) in spike-pFastBac1 mutants were made by Phusion PCR of the parent templates using N264D fwd and rvs or
PEDVS0033 rvs and PEDVS0231 fwd primers. The resulting PCR products were purified with NucleoSpin PCR cleanup
kit (Machery Nagel, Cat. #740609.50) to which was added 10X PNK buffer, 1 µL T4 polynucleotide kinase and 1 µL DpnI
(New England Biolabs, Cats. #M0201S and R0176S) and incubated at 37˚C for 1 hour. 3µL of this reaction, 1µL of 10X
T4 ligase buffer, 1µL of T4 ligase (New England Biolabs, Cat. #M0202S) and 5µL of water were incubated at room
temperature for 1 hour. The ligated DNA was then transformed into DH5a E. coli (Thermo Fisher, Cat. #18258012) and
selected on LB broth agar with 100µg/mL ampicillin.
Production of recombinant baculoviruses
Protein expression constructs in pFastBac1 were transformed into DH10Bac E. coli (Thermo Fisher, Cat. #
10361012) and selected on Luria broth agar with 50µg/mL kanamycin, 15µg/mL gentamycin, 0.5 mM isopropylthiogalactopyranoside (IPTG) and 20 µg/mL X-gal at 37˚C. White colonies, indicating recombinants, were grown in LB
broth and the recombinant bacmid DNA was prepared using the NucleoBond Xtra Bac Kit (Machery Nagel, Cat.
#740436.25). 1µg of recombinant bacmid DNA was combined in 1 mL of ESF-921 media (Expression Systems, Cat. #96001-01) with 20 µL of Cellfectin II (Thermo Fisher, Cat. #10362100) and added to 1´106 adherent Sf9 cells. Cells were
incubated for five days. Cell supernatants were clarified by centrifugation at 1500´g for 5 minutes. 0.5 mL of transfected
cell supernatant was used to amplify the baculoviruses on 5´106 adherent Sf9 cells for 5 days. First virus passage
supernatants were clarified by centrifugation. 1 mL of first passage supernatant was used to further amplify the baculovirus
on 50 ´106 suspension Sf9 cells and incubated for 5 days.
Recombinant protein production and purification
Baculovirus expressed proteins were produced by infecting 1 L of Sf9 at 2´106 cells with 10 mL of second
amplification baculovirus and incubating for four days. Infected cell supernatants were harvested by centrifugation at
1500´g to remove cells followed by 12,000´g to remove cell debris. Supernatants were filtered through a 0.45 µm filter
and then applied to a column of Streptactin agarose (Qiagen, Cat. #30004). The column was washed with 20 column volumes
of Tris-buffered saline and then the protein was eluted with same buffer with 2 mM desthiobiotin. The eluted protein was
purified by Superose6 Increase 10/30 (GE Life Sciences, Cat. #29091596) gel filtration.
Mammalian expressions were done by transient transfection. For both 293F and 293S cells, 1 L of cells at 1´106
cells were transfected with complexes composed of 250 µg of plasmid DNA and 750 µg of polyethylenimine (Polysciences,
Cat. # 24765-1). For the expression involving kifunensine, three hours after transfection kifunensine (Cayman Chemicals,
Cat. #10009437) was added to a final concentration of 5 µM. Expressions were allowed to proceed for five days. Cell
supernatants were collected by centrifugation at 1,500 ´ g to remove cells followed by 12,000 ´ g to remove cell debris.
Supernatants were filtered through a 0.45 µm filter and then applied to a column of Streptactin superflow. The column was
washed with 20 column volumes of Tris-buffered saline and then the protein was eluted with same buffer with 2 mM
desthiobiotin. The eluted protein was purified by Superose6 Increase 10/300 gel filtration.
Proteins were concentrated for structural studies using ultrafiltration (Sigma-Millipore, AmiconUltra 4 mL, 30K
MWCO, Cat. #UFC903024).
PEDV infection and sera collection
After 3-day acclimation, pigs in the challenged group were inoculated with a prototype US PEDV isolate
US/Iowa/18984/ 2013 (GenBank accession #KF804028) (Hoang et al., 2013), 103 plaque-forming units/pig, via oro-gastric
gavage as previously described (Madson et al., 2014). Pigs in the control group received virus-free cell culture media. Some
of these pigs were inoculated again with the same strain in the identical manner at day 56 post-inoculation (PI). The positive

swine sera used in the study were collected from pigs on day 76 PI (i.e., 20 days after the 2nd inoculation). The negative
swine serum was from one of age-matched control pigs. The positive serum had an antibody titer of 8 to 32 against PEDV
as measured by serum-virus neutralization test.
Preparation of polyclonal Fab fragments
IgG was isolated from porcine sera by passing the sera over a MabSelect 5 mL HiTrap Column (GE Life Sciences),
washing with two column volumes of tris-buffered saline and elution with 0.1 M glycine, pH 2.5. Acid elutions were
immediately neutralized with 1/10th volume of 1M tris base and then buffer exchanged 1:10 twice into tris-buffered saline.
IgG was digested to Fab and Fc using papain. Digestions were done in tris-buffered saline (25mM TrisCl pH 7.4, 150 mM
NaCl) with 5 mM dithiothreitol using 0.25% (w/w) papain for 2 hours at room temperature. The digest was quenched by
diluting 200 mM iodoacetamide (Sigma) 1/20 into the reaction. Undigested IgG was removed from the quenched reactions
by passing the reactions over a Superdex200 Increase 10/300 column (GE Life Sciences, Cat. #28990944) in tris-buffered
saline.
For polyclonal epitope analysis, 30 µg of purified Sf9 expressed full-length PEDV spike ectodomain was combined
with 1.5 mg of Fab/Fc fractions from gel filtration. The proteins were incubated overnight at room temperature. Fab-spike
complexes were isolated by gel filtration using a Superdex200 Increase 10/300 column in tris-buffered saline monitoring
the elutions at 215 nm and collecting the spike peaks. Collected fractions were concentrated by ultrafiltration.
Negative-stain electron microscopy
PEDV spikes and spike-Fab complexes for negative-stain electron microscopy were diluted to 30-50 µg/mL using
tris-buffered saline. 3 µL of protein sample was spotted onto glow-discharged carbon-coated copper grids and stained with
uranyl formate. Imaging of grids was performed using a T12 Tecnai Spirit operating at 120 kV and Tietz 4K camera and
Leginon (Suloway et al., 2005) data collection software. Images were assesed using EMHP (Berndsen et al., 2017) and
processed using RELION-3.0 (Zivanov et al., 2018) and CryoSparc 2.0 (Punjani et al., 2017). Briefly for spike samples,
particles were extracted in RELION binning by 2 and then reconstructed in CryoSparc. For spike-Fab complexes, particles
were extracted binning by 2 and reconstructed in C1 in RELION before extensive 3D classification with local alignment
followed by C1 3D refinement of unique classes.
Cryo-electron microscopy
PEDV spike ectodomain for cryo-EM was used at a final concentration of 1.3 mg/mL with 0.01% amphipol A8-35
(Anatrace). The protein was spotted onto UltraAuFoil 1.2/1.3 gold grids (Quantifoil) plasma cleaned using an Ar/O2 gas
mix. Grids were blotted for 3.5 s using a Vitrobot IV (Thermo Fisher) and then plunge frozen into liquid ethane at -185˚C.
Grids were imaged using a Talos Arctica (Thermo Fisher) at 200 kV with a K2 Summit camera (Gatan) and Leginon data
collection software. Micrograph movies were aligned using MotionCor2 (UCSF) (Zheng et al., 2017), CTF corrections were
done with Gctf (Zhang, 2016) and images were assessed with EMHP (Berndsen et al., 2017). Further data processing was
performed in RELION-3.0 (Zivanov et al., 2018). Particles were picked, extracted, 2D classified and 3D refined. Attempts
at C1 refinements and 3D sorting all produced reconstructions resembling C3 symmetry and so C3 symmetry was used in
the final reconstruction.
The model of NL63 spike ectodomain (5SZS.pdb) (Walls et al., 2016b) was used as a starting model. The model
was aligned an mutated to the PEDV spike sequence and rebuild using Coot (Emsley et al., 2010). Coordinate models were
further refined using real-space refinement in Phenix (Adams et al., 2010) and RosettaRelax (Wang et al., 2016). Model
validation was done using Molprobity (Williams et al., 2018) and EMRinger (Barad et al., 2015).
Mass spectrometry
The PEDV spike sample expressed in Sf9 cells was analyzed on Zorbax SB-C18 column (Agilent) with water with
0.1% formic acid and acetonitrile with 0.1% formic acid as mobile phases. The mass spectrometry data was acquired in
positive mode on Qtof Impact II (Bruker) and analyzed using Compass Data analysis 4.3 (Bruker).
QUANTIFICATION AND STATISTICAL ANALYSIS
Statistical models inherent to RELION-3.0 (Zivanov et al., 2018) and CryoSparc 2.0 (Punjani et al., 2017) were used to
create 3D classifications and 3D refinements from spike particle images.

Supplemental Figure 3: Alphacoronavirus spike proteins bind to palmitoleic acid. Comparison of the palmitoleic acid
binding site in density maps for A) the PEDV spike structure determined here, B) the previously determined PEDV spike
structure (Wrapp and McLellan, 2019) and C) the previously determined HuCoV-NL63 spike structure (Walls et al., 2016b).
The coordinates of palmitoleic acid built in the PEDV spike structure presented here were superposed onto the other spike
structures based on neighboring protein regions. Comparison of density in the second palmitoleic acid binding sites located
within PEDV S1 domain A in D) the spike structure presented here as well as E) the previously determined PEDV spike
structure (Wrapp and McLellan, 2019). Note that the palmitoleic acid density appears to adopt an alternate conformation in
the previously determined PEDV spike structure. The coordinates of palmitoleic acid were real space refined to reflect this
altered conformation. The altered fatty acid conformation may be due to differences in the conformation of this region of
the protein (see main text).
