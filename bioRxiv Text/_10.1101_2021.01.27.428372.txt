Abstract
Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) causes a vast
number of infections and fatalities worldwide. As the development and safety validation
of effective vaccines are ongoing, drug repurposing is most efficient approach to search
FDA approved agents against coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). In the present
study, we found that endogenous ACE2 expressions could be detected in H322M and
Calu-3 cell lines, as well as their ACE2 mRNA and protein expressions were suppressed
by pyrrolidine dithiocarbamate (PDTC), a NF-kappa B inhibitor, in dose- and timedependent manners. Moreover, N-acetyl-cysteine (NAC) pretreatment reversed PDTCinduced ACE2 suppression, as well as the combined treatment of hydrogen peroxide
and knockdown of p50 subunit of NF-kappa B by siRNA reduced ACE2 expression in
H322M cells. In addition, anthelmintic drug triclabendazole and antiprotozoal drug
emetine, repurposed drugs of NF-kappa B inhibitor, also inhibited ACE2 mRNA and
protein expressions in H322M cells. Moreover, zinc supplement augmented the
suppressive effects of triclabendazole and emetine on ACE2 suppression in H322M and
Calu-3 cells. Taken together, these results indicate that ACE2 expression is modulated
by reactive oxygen species (ROS) and NF-kappa B signal in human lung cell lines, and
zinc combination with triclabendazole or emetine has the clinical potential for the
prevention and treatment of COVID-19.

Introduction
Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) caused the
coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic, and more than 95 million confirmed
cases were identified worldwide by the beginning of 2021 (COVID-19 Coronavirus
Pandemic Update Worldometer). The clinical spectrum of COVID-19 can be very
heterogenous, ranging from asymptomatic forms to severe manifestations, including
the acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) (1). Severe COVID-19 complications
are associated with the cytokine storm syndrome, an uncontrolled over-production of
inflammation factors which leads to sustain an aberrant systemic inflammatory
response contributing to the high mortality rate of the disease (2). SARS-CoV-2 already
caused more than 2 million fatalities until now, and since there is no specific treatment
prescribed to treat COVID-19, therefore, to redevelop an existing drug for licensed use
in COVID-19 therapy seems valuable.
Angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) has a multiplicity of physiological roles
in renin-angiotensin system (RAS) and amino acid transport. ACE2 receptors are
ubiquitous and widely expressed in the heart, vessels, gut, lung, kidney, testis and brain
(3). At the initial step of SARS-CoV-2 infection, the viral spike (S) glycoproteins
interact first with ACE2 receptors on the target cell surface, and are then proteolytically
cleaved by trans membrane protease serine 2 (TMPRSS2) to trigger fusion of the viral
envelope with the target cell membrane (4, 5). Therefore, targeting the Spike-ACE2
binding event has been logically viewed as a promising strategy to mitigate viral
infection and control the infection. To date, decoy ACE2 soluble protein (6), ACE2
inhibitor and TMPRSS2 inhibitor (4) had been investigated for trapping the virus and
blocking the binding of spike protein for reducing the accessibility of the virus to host
cells (7). Their clinical efficacy and safety for COVID-19 patients are still exploring.
Therefore, new therapeutic options against this viral entry are urgently desired.

Viral spike protein or dsRNA of SARS-CoV-2 may activate the NF-κB pathway
in non-immune cells such as alveolar epithelial cells and endothelial cells, eventually
lead to cytokine storm in severe COVID-19 patients (8). Therefore, inhibition of NFκB pathway has been considered to be a potential therapeutic strategy for alleviating
the severe form of COVID-19. In patients hospitalized with Covid-19, the use of
dexamethasone, acts as NF-kB inhibitor, resulted in lower 28-day mortality among
those who were receiving either invasive mechanical ventilation or oxygen alone at
randomization but not among those receiving no respiratory support (9). The results
suggest that the beneficial role of dexamethasone may be at least partly related to the
inhibition of NF-κB activation in the severe COVID- 19 patients. Abnormal NF-B
signaling is also linked with certain neoplasia, Miller et al had used NF-κB mediated βlactamase reporter gene assay to screen approximately 2,800 clinically approved drugs,
and identified nineteen drugs that have previously unappreciated effects on NF-B
signaling, which may contribute to anticancer therapeutic effects (10). Of these,
antiprotozoal drug emetine and anthelmintic drug triclabendazole can inhibit NF-B
signaling via inhibition of IκBα phosphorylation. Since antiprotozoal and anthelmintic
drugs has lower cellular toxicity than those of anti-cancer drugs, emetine and
triclabendazole were selected to investigate their effect on ACE2 expression in this
study.
Zinc has been shown to mediate antiviral effects through improving the
mucociliary clearance of virus, strengthening the integrity of the epithelium, decreasing
viral replication, preserving antiviral immunity, attenuating the risk of hyperinflammation, supporting anti-oxidative effects (11). Observational studies have
reported that lower baseline zinc levels in hospitalized adults were associated with a
higher risk of mortality, complications, and longer hospital stay following SARS-CoV2 infection (12), suggesting potential benefits of zinc supplementation in reducing

COVID-19 morbidity and mortality. Moreover, the clinical trials on zinc
supplementation in combination with other drugs such as hydroxychloroquine or
chloroquine have been registered (13), and the anticipated results coming soon. Because
zinc supplementation is a cost-efficient, globally available and simple to use option
with little to no side effects, it has most potential to in combination with other
repurposed drugs against COVID-19 treatment.
ACE2 expression in Huh7 (hepatocellular carcinoma cells) is increased by the
treatment of AMPK activator, through NAD-dependent deacetylase SIRT1 (silent
information regulator T1) dependent pathway. (14). However, the detail mechanism of
ACE2 expression in lung cells is still remain unclear. In this present study, we found
ACE2 expressions in lung cancer cells were suppressed by NF- inhibitor, ammonium
pyrrolidine dithiocarbamate (PDTC), and clinical drugs, triclabendazole and emetine,
which are able to inhibit NF-kB signaling. Moreover, zinc supplement augmented the
suppressive effects of triclabendazole and emetine on ACE2 expression in lung cancer
cells. These findings anticipate that the combination of repurposed inhibitor drugs of
NF-B and zinc supplementary may have a potential to alleviate and prevent the severe
COVID-19 pandemics.

Results
NF-B inhibitor, PDTC, decreases endogenous ACE2 expressions in H322M and
Calu-3 lung cancer cells.
SARS-CoV-2 spike protein binds cell surface ACE2 proteins of target cells to
initiate viral entry, agents possessing the interaction blocking could be possible
therapeutic strategies for the prevention and treatment of SARS-CoV-2 infection. In
order to explore the regulatory mechanism of ACE2 expressions in lung cells, the
expression levels of endogenous ACE2 protein were evaluated in 6 lung cancer cell
lines by western blot assay. It was found that the highest and middle expression levels
of ACE2 were detected in Calu-3 and H322M cells, respectively, compared to the other
4 cell lines (Fig. 1A). Therefore, Calu-3 and H322M cells were selected for the
following experiments. Inhibition of NF-B signaling has a potential therapeutic role
in alleviating the severe form of COVID-19 through reduction in the cytokine storm
(15). To further explore whether NF-B pathway also play a role in ACE2 regulation,
PDTC, an inhibitor of NF-B activation, was used to treat cells and the cytotoxic effect
of PDTC was investigated by MTS assay. After PDTC treatment, we found that 200
M PDTC did not lead to critical cell death (Fig. 1B), therefore. this concentration was
used to process for following experiments. To explore the PDTC effect on mRNA
expression of ACE2, both H322M and Calu-3 cells were treated with a series dose of
PDTC and the mRNA expressions were evaluated. The results showed that PDTC
treatment decreased the RNA levels of ACE2 in a dose-dependent manner in these two
cell lines (Fig. 1C and 1D). In addition, these two cell lines were also treated PDTC,
and the protein expressions of ACE2 were examined at different time points. The results
showed that PDTC treatment obviously decreased the ACE2 protein expressions in a
time-dependent manner in H322M and Calu-3 cells (Fig. 1E and 1F). These findings
indicate that ACE2 expression is regulated by NF-B signal pathway, and implicate that

clinical drugs with the activity of NF-B inhibition may exert beneficial effects against
covid-19 disease.

N-acetyl-cysteine blocks PDTC-derived ACE2 suppression in H322M cells.
To further explore the underlying mechanism of PDTC-derived ACE2 suppression,
p50 subunit of NF-B was inhibited by its specific siRNA and its associated effect on
ACE2 protein expression were evaluated. It was found that p50 proteins were obviously
inhibited by the specific siRNA, however, ACE2 protein expression was not obviously
affected in H322M cells (Fig. 2A). Previous studies had indicated that PDTC is a metalchelating compound that exerts both pro-oxidant and antioxidant effects (16). To
explore whether ROS involves in PDTC-derived ACE2 suppression, H322m cells were
pretreated with N-acetyl-cysteine (NAC) to inhibit ROS production during PDTC
treatment. We noted that NAC treatment alone enhanced ACE2 mRNA and protein
expressions, whereas NAC pretreatment blocked PDTC-induced ACE2 suppression in
both of mRNA and protein levels (Fig. 2 B and 2C), suggesting PDTC acts as a prooxidant in H322M cells. To mimic the condition caused by PDTC in H322M cells,
H322M cells with p50 knockdown were treated with H2O2 and ACE2 expressions were
evaluated. Immunoblotting of PARP was conducted to monitor cell death level. It was
found that H2O2 treatment suppressed ACE2 expressions in p50-silenced H322M cells,
but not in control cells (Fig. 2D). These results together suggest that PDTC suppresses
ACE2 expression through ROS induction and NF-B inhibition in H322M cells.
Triclabendazole or emetine administration suppresses endogenous ACE2
expression of H322M cells.
Drug repurposing is a fast approach to using clinical approved drugs for different
disease treatments bypassing the long streamline of the drug discovery process. Base
on the concept, NF-B inhibitor, triclabendazole and emetine (10), were selected to

investigate their effects on ACE2 expression of lung cancer cells. First, the cytotoxic
effects of triclabendazole and emetine against H322M cells were investigated to
identify the suitable dose range of triclabendazole and emetine for experiments. It was
found that 100 M triclabendazole and 125 nM emetine treatment did not caused
apparently inhibition of cell growth (Fig. 3A). To further explore the effects of
triclabendazole or emetine on mRNA expression of ACE2, H322M cells were treated
with different concentrations of triclabendazole or emetine, and we fund that these two
drugs suppressed ACE2 expressions in a dose-dependent manner (Fig. 3B). The
treatment of 100 M triclabendazole or 100 nM emetine individually inhibited a half
of ACE2 mRNA levels of H322M cells. As well as the treatment of triclabendazole or
emetine also decreased the ACE2 protein expressions in a time-dependent manner (Fig.
3C). Immunoblotting of PARP was conducted to monitor cell death level, and there was
no apparently cleaved PARP, a marker of apoptosis, was detected, except of the cells
with triclabendazole treatment for 48 hours. These findings suggest that triclabendazole
and emetine, FDA approved clinical drugs, exhibit anti-SARS-CoV-2 activity via ACE2
suppression to reduce viral infection.

Zinc supplement augmentes the suppressive effects of triclabendazole and
emetine on ACE2 expressions in H322M and Calu-3 cells.
Combination therapy is a valuable approach to use different drugs blocking similar
pathways to increase treatment efficacy and reduce the dose and side effects of toxic
drugs. Zinc is a trace element with potent immunoregulatory and antiviral properties,
and is utilizing in the treatment of COVID-19, even its clinical outcome is still unclear
(17). Here, we investigated the effects of triclabendazole or emetine alone, or its
combination with zinc sulfate on ACE2 expression of the lung cell lines. First, it was
found that ACE2 mRNA and protein was slightly repressed by the treatment of 300 M

zinc sulfate (Fig. 4A and 4B). To investigate whether zinc treatment combined with
triclabendazole or emetine has the ability to reduce the drug dose for ACE2 suppression,
H322M and Calu-3 cells were treated with triclabendazole, emetine, zinc sulfate alone,
or in combination with zinc sulfate and each of these two clinical drugs for 24 hours.
We proved that ACE2 protein expressions did not be dramatically repressed in H322M
and Calu-3 cells treated with triclabendazole, emetine or zinc sulfate alone, whereas
zinc treatment combined with triclabendazole or emetine apparently suppressed the
ACE2 protein expressions (Fig. 4C and 4D). Meanwhile, there was no apparently
cleaved PARP, a marker of apoptosis, was detected in these two cell lines. These
findings anticipate that triclabendazole or emetine plus zinc supplementation may be
more effective in reducing virus amplification through decreasing ACE2 protein
expression than triclabendazole or emetine monotherapy.

Discussion
Globally, a number of repurposing drugs, known to act on interruption of virus life
cycle and modulation of host immune response, are now being investigated in clinical
trials for the patients with moderate-to-severe COVID-19. For example, remdesivir (an
RNA polymerase inhibitor) was able to reduce the time to recovery in adults who were
hospitalized with COVID-19 and had evidence of lower respiratory tract infection (18).
Immunosuppressive drugs, such as tocilizumab (19), hydrocortisone (20), baricitinib
(21) and dexamethasone (22) have been evaluating in clinical trials, however, until now
there is still lack of the overwhelming evidence supporting their beneficial effects on
COVID-19 therapy. Therefore, searching for FDA approved drugs that can effectively
control SARS-CoV-2 infection are urgently needed. In this present study, we
demonstrated that endogenous ACE2 expression could be repressed by NF-B inhibitor,
as well as triclabendazole and emetine, act as immunosuppressive drugs through NFB inhibition, also exhibit the ability to suppress ACE2 expression of human lung cell
lines, implicating their potential to mitigate the virus's accessibility.
As the respiratory droplets carrying infectious SARS-Cov-2 virus are inhaled into
the upper air way, viral spike (S) protein will preferentially bind to the membrane
protein ACE2 on epithelial cells for virus entry. Moreover, previous study in patients
with COVID-19 indicated that airway epithelial cells showed an average three-fold
increase in expression of the SARS-CoV-2 entry receptor ACE2 (23), suggesting that
ACE2 increase induced by virus infection may facilitate viral amplification. Therefore,
to understand the factors affecting ACE2 expression may help us to prevent ACE2
induction during SARS-CoV-2 virus infection. We had explored the endogenous ACE2
expressions in six different lung cell lines and found that the highest and middle levels
of ACE2 expressions were detected in Calu-3 and H322M cells, respectively (Fig. 1A).
Calu-3 has the highest expression of ACE2 may be due to Calu-3 is a mucus-producing

submucosal gland carcinoma cell line derived from human bronchial epithelium (24),
which is consistent with that the highest expression of ACE2 was found in nasal
secretory cells (25).
COVID-19 patients with severe COVID-19 displayed the uncontrolled NF-Brelated cytokine release syndrome (CRS), which is responsible for the poor prognosis
and multiorgan defects (8). Thus, the pharmacological blockade of the NF-B signaling
pathway can strongly represent a potential therapeutic consideration to attenuate
COVID-19. For example, hydrocortisone and dexamethasone were proved to exhibit
the activity of NF-B inhibition, meanwhile their clinical trials for Covid-19 therapy
are ongoing (26, 27). Here, we proved that administration of pyrrolidine
dithiocarbamate (PDTC) inhibited the endogenous ACE2 mRNA and protein
expressions in Calu-3 and H322M cells in a dose- and time-dependent manner (Fig.
1C-1F), suggesting that activation of NF-B signaling is required for ACE2 expression
in lung epithelial cells. While blocking NF-B signaling via p50 siRNA, however,
ACE2 expression was not dramatically repressed in H322M cells (Fig. 2A), indicating
that NF-B inhibition and a PDTC-derived another event cooperate in PDTC-induced
ACE2 suppression in H322M cells. Previous study had indicated that PDTC is a metalchelating compound that exerts both pro-oxidant and antioxidant effects (16). In
addition, thiol antioxidants reversed PDTC actions on blocking DNA binding activity
of NF-B (28). Here, we found that the pretreatment of thiol oxidant, N-acetyl-cysteine
(NAC), abolished PDTC-induced ACE2 suppression in both of mRNA and protein
levels (Fig. 2B and 2C). Moreover, the administration of hydrogen peroxide augmented
the inhibition of ACE2 expression in H322M cells with p50 silenced (Figure 2D),
implicating the pro-oxidant role of PDTC involves in ACE2 suppression. More studies
need to be done for dissecting of detailed mechanism of PDTC-induced ACE2
suppression in the future.

To explore the potential clinical application of our findings, we sought FDAapproved drugs with the property of NF-B inhibition to explore their effects on ACE2
expression in H322M cells. In the present study, antiprotozoal drug emetine and
anthelmintic drug triclabendazole were selected to investigate their effects on ACE2
expression. The IC50 values of inhibiting IκBα phosphorylation for emetine and
triclabendazole are 0.31 M and 25.1 M, respectively (10). Administration of 100 nM
emetine or 100 M triclabendazole significantly repressed ACE2 expressions in both
of mRNA and protein levels in H322M cells (Fig. 3B and 3C). It is noteworthy that the
serum levels of inflammatory cytokines were significantly reduced by emetine
treatment in the pulmonary hypertension rat model (29). Moreover, triclabendazole
treatment obviously reduced inflammatory cytokine levels, indicating the improvement
of the immunological responses of the patients with acute or chronic stage of fasciolosis
(30). The results in the present and earlier studies suggest that emetine and
triclabendazole may exhibit therapeutic potential in COVID-19 patients through
breaking of virus life cycle and modulation of host immune response.
Combination therapy has proven successful in a variety of medical areas, such as
infectious and metabolic diseases. The advantages of combination therapy include to
increase treatment efficacy, to reduce the dose and side effects of toxic drugs, prevent
the development of drug resistance, and to reduce the duration of treatment. Previous
studies had implicated that zinc may possess antiviral activity and anti‑inflammatory
activity through inhibition of SARS‑CoV RNA polymerase and disruption of NF‑κB
signaling, respectively (17, 31). In addition, it was noted that 57.4% of the COVID-19
patients were zinc deficient, as well as these patients had higher rates of complications,
acute respiratory distress syndrome, prolonged hospital stay, and increased mortality
(12). Despite the lack of clinical data, the previous findings suggest that modulation of
zinc status may be beneficial in COVID‑19. In this study, we found that zinc

administration alone did not apparently affect ACE2 mRNA and protein levels in
H322M cells, exception of high dose treatment (Fig. 4A and 4B). By contrast, the
apparent ACE2 suppressions were observed 24 hours only after combined treatment of
150 M zinc sulfate with 50 M triclabendazole or 100 nM emetine in H322M and
Calu-3 cells (Fig. 4C and 4D), compared with the monotreatment of triclabendazole or
emetine. Taken together, these findings indicate that zinc supplement exhibits the ability
to augment the inhibitive effect of triclabendazole and emetine on ACE2 suppression,
and implicate that zine supplement may increase the potential clinical application of
triclabendazole or emetine for COVID -19 prevention and treatment.
Besides immunosuppressive functions of zinc, triclabendazole and emetine, we
demonstrated that zinc administration also enhanced the suppressive effects of
triclabendazole and emetine on endogenous ACE2 expressions of H322M and Calu-3
cells, hypothesizing that triclabendazole or emetine plus zinc supplementation may be
more effective in reducing COVID-19 morbidity and mortality than triclabendazole or
emetine monotherapy. Therefore, triclabendazole or emetine in combination with zinc
should be considered as additional study arm for COVID-19 clinical trials. Given ACE2
plays many important biological roles in regulating cardiovascular, renal and innate
immune systems, therefore, leveraging ACE2 as a therapeutic target for COVID-19
requires collective considerations to balance the pros and cons. In order to maximize
therapeutic effectiveness while minimizing collateral adverse effects, inhalable delivery
would seem to be a logical option to selectively and locally deposit triclabendazole or
emetine combined with zinc to lung epithelial cells in the airway and airspace
compartments. To prove the hypothesis, of cause, more works have to be done.

(Millipore Corporation, Billerica, MA, USA). Primary antibodies used in this study
included those against β-actin (GTX109639; dilution 1:10,000; GeneTex, Inc.), poly
(ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP) (9542S; dilution 1:1,000; Cell Signaling Technology,
Inc.), ACE2 (bs-1004R; dilution 1:1,000; Bioss, Inc.), and p50 (Santa Cruz
Biotechnology, Inc., USA; dilution 1:1000). The HRP-conjugated secondary antibodies
recognizing mouse-IgG (7076) or rabbit-IgG (7074) were purchased from Cell
Signaling Technology, Inc. (dilution 1:5000~10000). The chemiluminescence signal
was recorded using the BioSpectrum UVP810 Imaging System with VisionWorks
software (GE Healthcare Life Sciences).

Knockdown of p50 by electroporation
To knock down p50 RNA expression, scrambled control and SMARTpool siRNA
targeting p50 (Dharmacon, Lafayette, CO, USA) were delivered into H322M cells
using Neon transfection system (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's
instructions. Forty-eight hours after incubation in cell culture, the knockdown
efﬁciencies were determined by protein levels of the targeted genes using Western blot
assay.

Statistical analysis
All values were expressed as mean  standard error. The Student’s t-test was used
to analyze the results, and a P value of less than 0.05 was considered statistically
significant.

Figure legends
Figure 1. NF-B inhibitor treatment inhibiteds endogenous ACE2 expressions of
H322M and Calu-3 lung cancer cells. (A) Endogenous ACE2 protein expressions of 6
different lung cancer cells were investigated by Western blot assay using -actin as
loading control. (B) H322M cells were seeded in 96-well plates and treated with a
concentration series of PDTC (0, 12.5, 25, 50, 100 or 200 M) for 48 hours, then the
relative cell viabilities were determined by MTS assay. Error bars represented the
standard deviation. The viability of control cells was designated as 100%, and that of
the other groups were expressed as percent of the control. (C and D) H322M and Calu3 cells were treated with a concentration series of PDTC (0, 50, 100 or 200 M) for 24
hours and the total RNAs were collected for ACE2 measurement by real-time qRT-PCR
assays. The data were normalized by GAPDH expression and presented as mean ± SEM
(n = 3). (***p < 0.0005). (E and F) H322M and Calu-3 cells were treated with 200 M
PDTC, then harvested at different time points after treatment. Treated cells were lysed
for Western blot analysis of ACE2, and -actin was used as loading control.
