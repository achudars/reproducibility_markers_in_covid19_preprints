Abstract
Many inactivation methods have been shown to inactivate SARS-CoV-2 for safe and
efficient diagnostic methods. COVID-19 is caused by airborne infection of SARS-CoV2, and therefore, methods of inactivating the virus efficiently and safely are crucial for
reducing the risk of airborne infection. In this regard, the effect of plasma discharge on
the infectivity of the coronaviruses mouse hepatitis virus (MHV) and SARS-CoV-2 was
tested. Plasma discharge efficiently reduced the infectivity of both coronaviruses.
Treatment of SARS-CoV-2 in culture medium with a plasma discharge resulted in
95.17% viral inactivation after plasma irradiation after 1 hour (hr), 99.54% inactivation
after 2 hrs and 99.93% inactivation after 3 hrs. Similar results were obtained for MHV.
The results indicated that plasma discharge effectively and safely inactivated the
airborne coronaviruses and may be useful in minimizing the risk of airborne infection of
SARS-CoV-2.

Introduction
Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is characterized by fever, cough, myalgia to
severe acute respiratory distress, and multiorgan dysfunction in the case of severe cases,
and the clinical manifestations are similar to severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS)
and middle east respiratory syndrome (MERS). COVID-19 was first identified in
December 2019 in Wuhan, China, and then spread throughout the world [1-3]. The
World Health Organization declared the COVID-19 outbreak to be a pandemic in
March 2020, and since then the numbers of infections around the world rose, reaching
more than 25 million infections and over 850,000 deaths by 15 September 2020.
COVID-19 is caused by a novel coronavirus, SARS coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2),
belonging to the genus Betacoronavirus, family Coronaviridae [1-4]. Since
coronaviruses are enveloped RNA viruses, many disinfectants such as a variety of
detergents and alcohols, such as ethanol and 2-propanol, have been shown to inactivate
SARS-CoV-2 infectivity [5-23].
SARS-CoV-2 transmits from human to human mainly via airborne routes such as
droplets and aerosols [24]; however, the virus also infects by direct contact with viruscontaminated surfaces [25]. In fact, the virus has been shown to be relatively stable on
plastic and stainless steel surfaces and on surgical masks for up to 7 days [26-28]. To
reduce or minimize the risk of airborne infection of SARS-CoV-2, it is important to
disinfect the virus in aerosols and/or droplet nuclei.
Since non-thermal plasmas generated at atmospheric pressure produce active
molecules that cause various chemical reactions at room temperature, they are being
investigated for use as a process technology with high energy efficiency [29]. Among
such plasmas, a “streamer” is a discharge mode in which a wide plasma region can be
formed between the electrodes [30], and thus it is the most efficient and capable of
generating a large number of active molecules. If viruses are exposed to the active
molecules generated from streamers, it is expected that proteins on the surfaces of the
viruses will be denatured by chemical reactions and their viral activity will be lost. In
this report, we analyzed this inactivating effect by exposing coronaviruses to streamers.

Mouse astrocytoma-derived DBT cells were obtained from the Japanese Collection of
Research Bioresources (https://cellbank.nibiohn.go.jp/english/) (JCRB) and cultured in
Eagle’s medium (MEM, Fujifilm Woko Chemicals, Japan) supplemented with 5% heatinactivated fetal bovine serum (FBS, Thermo Fisher Scientific, Rockford, IL), 1% (w/v)
tryptose phosphate broth (Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO) and antibiotics (10 units/mL
penicillin and 10 μg/mL streptomycin, Fujifilm Wako Chemicals).
Vero E6 cells and Vero E6/TMRPSS2 cells obtained from JCRB Cell Bank under
no. JCRB1819, Japan were cultured at 37 °C in Dulbecco’s modified Eagle’s medium
(DMEM, Nacalai Tesque, Japan) supplemented with 5% heat-inactivated fetal bovine
serum (FBS, Thermo Fisher Scientific, Rockford, IL) and antibiotics (10 units/mL
penicillin and 10 μg/mL streptomycin, Thermo Fisher Scientific).
Viruses:
MHV, strain A59, was obtained from the American Type Culture Collection (Summit
Pharmaceuticals International, Japan) and propagated in DBT cells in DMEM/Ham’s F12 medium (Fujifilm Wako Chemicals) supplemented with 10% FBS and antibiotics.
SARS-CoV-2, strain AI/I-004/2020, was obtained from the National Institute of
Infectious Diseases, Tokyo, Japan and propagated in Vero E6 cells in DMEM
supplemented with 1% FBS and antibiotics.
Plasma irradiation:
A plasma discharge apparatus was used to irradiate the viruses in the media. Part of the
plasma discharge device was mounted on one of a series of streamer air purifier
products of Daikin Industries, Ltd., and a high voltage was applied to a discharge device
having multiple pairs of discharge electrodes to cause a streamer discharge. In the
experiment, the virus was placed in a 6-well plate (0.5 mL/well) without a top cover
(Product No. 3335, Corning, NY), and the discharge device was placed 10 cm above the
plate. The entire experimental system was placed in an acrylic container having an
internal volume of 30.9 L (24 cm  46 cm  28 cm) and sealed. After applying a voltage
of 6-7 kV between the electrodes to cause a current of 55 μA and exposing the virus to
the plasma at 25 °C for 0, 1, 2, and 3 hours, respectively, then the virus was collected
and subjected to virus infectivity titration.

Virus titration:
Titration of MHV was performed as described previously. Briefly, DBT cells seeded on
60 mm dishes were inoculated with serially 10-fold diluted samples and incubated at
37 °C for 1 hr in a 5% CO2 incubator. Then the inoculum was replaced with an agarose
medium consisting of MEM supplemented with 2% FBS, 1% (w/v) tryptose phosphate
broth, 1% agarose and antibiotics and then cultured for 2 days at 37 °C in 5% CO2. The
plaques caused by MHV infection were stained by an overlay of agarose medium
containing 0.01% neutral red (Sigma-Aldrich). The infectious titer of MHV was
expressed as a plaque-forming unit (pfu)/mL. The infectious titer of SARS-CoV-2 was
obtained as a 50% tissue culture infectious dose (TCID50/mL). The Vero E6/TMPRSS2
cells cultured in 96-well microplates were inoculated with serially 10-fold diluted
samples (each 6-wells/dilution) and incubated for 4 days at 37 °C in 5% CO2. The
numbers of wells showing cytopathic effect (CPE) at each dilution were counted, and
TCID50/mL was calculated by the Reed–Muench method.
TaqMan RT-PCR:
RNA copies upon plasma irradiation of SARS-CoV-2 were quantitatively determined
by using the TaqMan RT-PCR method as described previously [31], with slight
modification. Briefly, the virus specimens before and after plasma irradiation were
treated with Buffer AVL containing carrier RNA, and RNA was extracted according to
the manufacturer’s instructions for QIAmp Viral RNA Mini Kit (Qiagen, Hilden,
Germany).
TaqMan RT-PCR was performed with the N2 primer/probe set and BigDye
Terminator v3.1 Cycle Sequencing Kit (Thermo Fischer Scientific) [31] using the
QuantStudio 5 system (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Rockford, IL).
Biosafety:
Experiments using infectious MHV and SARS-CoV-2 were conducted in a biosafety
level (BSL)-2 laboratory in The University of Tokyo and a BSL-3 laboratory in
Okayama University of Science, respectively.

We examined the inactivation of MHV after irradiation with the plasma streamer. The
infectivity of the virus in the medium after 1, 2, and 3 hrs plasma irradiation was
measured and expressed as pfu/mL (Table 1). In mock irradiation (control), the virus
infectivity was determined to be 5.26  107 pfu/mL, 5.64  107 pfu/mL, 5.45  107
pfu/mL and 3.56  107 pfu/mL after 0, 1, 2 and 3 hrs, respectively. The virus infectivity
upon plasma stream irradiation was 2.06  107 pfu/mL, 1.57  106 pfu/mL, and 5.42 
104 pfu/mL after irradiation for 1, 2, and 3 hrs, respectively. When compared to the
titers of corresponding times of the mock irradiation, the reductions in the virus titers
upon plasma irradiation were 63.44%, 97.12%, and 99.85% after 1, 2, and 3 hrs
irradiation, respectively.
Inactivation of SARS-CoV-2 upon plasma irradiation:
We examined the inactivation of SASR-CoV-2 after irradiation with the plasma
streamer. The infectivity of the virus in the medium after 1, 2, and 3 hrs plasma
irradiation was measured and expressed as TCID50/mL (Table 2). In mock irradiation
(control), the virus infectivity was 2.23  107 TCID50/mL, 2.17  107 TCID50/mL, 1.10
 107 TCID50/mL, and 9.96  106 TCID50/mL after 0, 1, 2, and 3 hrs, respectively. The
virus infectivity upon plasma stream irradiation was 1.05  106 TCID50/mL, 5.01  104
TCID50/mL, and 6.53  103 TCID50/mL after irradiation for 1, 2, and 3 hrs, respectively.
When compared to the titers of the corresponding times of the mock irradiation, the
reductions of the virus titers upon plasma irradiation were 95.17%, 99.54%, and 99.93%
after 1, 2, and 3 hrs irradiation, respectively (Table 2).
Effect of plasma irradiation on SARS-CoV-2 RNA copies of SARS-CoV-2 in the
medium:
We examined the effect of the number of RNA copies of SASR-CoV-2 after irradiation
with the plasma streamer. The RNA of the virus in the medium after 1, 2, and 3 hrs of
mock irradiation or plasma streamer irradiation in experiment 1 described above was
extracted. The RNA was extracted from the plasma-irradiated and mock-irradiated
viruses, and then the RNA was diluted 1,000-fold and subjected to TaqMan RT-PCR. In
the mock irradiation, the numbers of virus RNA copies were calculated to be slightly
reduced from those of the 0 hr treated virus of 1.1  1011 RNA copies/mL to 1.0  1011
RNA copies/mL, 9.1  1010 RNA copies/mL, and 8.3  1010 RNA copies/mL after

mock irradiation for 1, 2 and 3 hrs, respectively. These reductions in the RNA
copies/mL compared to the 0 hr treated virus were 8.3%, 17.2%, and 21.4% after 1, 2,
and 3 hrs, respectively. The numbers of virus RNA copies upon plasma stream
irradiation were 1.7  1010 RNA copies/mL, 2.9  109 RNA copies/mL, and 6.9  108
RNA copies/mL after irradiation for 1, 2, and 3 hrs, respectively. When compared to the
RNA copies of the corresponding times with the mock irradiation, the reductions of the
virus RNA copies upon plasma irradiation were 82.94%, 96.79%, and 99.17% after 1, 2,
and 3 hrs irradiation, respectively (Table 3).
Discussion
The stability of coronaviruses, including SARS-CoV-2, in different environmental
conditions has been reported. A variety of commercially available disinfectants have
been shown to be effective in inactivating SARS-CoV-2. However, the virus has been
shown to be relatively stable in dried form, especially on stainless plastic surfaces and
on the outer layers of masks, and infectious virus has been recovered after up to 4 to 7
days. The virus has been shown to be more stable in liquid form. Coronaviruses like
MHV and SARS-CoV-2 are thought to infect susceptible animals and humans by
aerosols and direct contact. To reduce or minimize the risk of airborne infection of
SARS-CoV-2, it is important to disinfect the virus in aerosols and/or droplet nuclei.
Recently, studies on the inactivation of viruses, bacteria, and fungi by plasma irradiation
have been reported. However, the mechanism of inactivation of microorganisms by
plasma irradiation is not fully understood. Streamer discharge technology, which is a
type of plasma discharge, produces various active substances by the collision of
electrons moving at high speed in the plasma region with molecules such as nitrogen,
oxygen, and water vapor in the atmosphere. For example, metastable nitrogen is
considered to play an important role in various chained chemical reactions due to its
high energy level and long life [32, 33].
Other studies have examined methods of exposing microorganisms directly to
plasma [34]. According to these methods, high-energy electrons and short-lived active
species, which are always present in large quantities in the plasma space, can be used.
Therefore, the inactivation efficiency is increased, and the time required is shortened.
However, this method is suitable for inactivating small areas only and is not suitable for

processing large areas. Thus, it is not considered to inactivate microorganisms
efficiently when their concentrations are low.
In the present study, the inactivation rates of two coronaviruses, MHV and SARSCoV-2, were virtually identical, indicating that the mechanisms of inactivation were the
same. The decay rate of SARS-CoV-2 RNAs determined by RT-qPCR was slightly
slower compared to that determined by SARS-CoV-2 infectivity. The RT-qPCR used in
the present study detected 138 bases of the virus RNA; thus, the decay of the RNA
measured by the RT-qPCR detected disruption of the virus RNA into fewer than 138
bases. However, virus infectivity will be lost even if there is only partial damage to the
virus RNA with a size of 29,903 bases caused by plasma irradiation because an intact
virus genome is necessary for the virus to replicate in the infected cells. In this regard, it
is likely that SARS-CoV-2 inactivation based on RT-qPCR was underestimated
compared to that based on the infectivity assay. Thus, the virus infectivity was reduced
or lost by both a loss of virus protein functions and a disruption of viral RNAs.
In the present study, various active molecules are generated in the plasma region of
a streamer in space and exposed to a target away from the plasma. Although the time
required for inactivation is slightly longer [34], this form of application is suitable for
inactivating large spaces and large amounts of air. In this regard, a quantitative
measurement of such active molecules is a difficult technique that requires sophisticated
equipment and skills. Further progress is necessary to clarify the mechanism of virus
inactivation in the future.
In conclusion, a plasma streamer was shown to be effective in inactivating the
coronaviruses MHV and SARS-CoV-2.
