Abstract
The recently ermerging disease COVID-19 is caused by the new SARS-CoV-2 virus first
detected in the city of Wuhan, China. From there it has been rapidly spreading inside and
outside China. With initial death rates around 4%, COVID-19 patients at longer distances
from Wuhan showed reduced mortality as was previously observed for the SARS
coronavirus. However, the new coronavirus spreads more strongly, as it sheds long before
onset of symptoms or may be transmitted by people without symptoms. Rapid development
of a protective vaccine against COVID-19 is therefore of paramount importance. Here we
demonstrate that recombinantly expressed receptor binding domain (RBD) of the spike
protein homologous to SARS binds to ACE2, the viral receptor. Higly repetitive display of
RBD on immunologically optimized virus-like particles derived from cucumber mosaic virus
resulted in a vaccine candidate (RBD-CuMVTT) that induced high levels of specific antibodies
in mice which were able to block binding of spike protein to ACE2 and potently neutralized
the SARS-CoV-2 virus in vitro.

Main
COVID-19 is caused by a novel coronavirus closely related to viruses causing SARS and
MERS. As the disease caused by the other two viruses, COVID-19 mainly manifests
symptoms in the lung and causes cough and fever1. The disease COVID-19 is less severe
than SARS and MERS, which is beneficial per se but leads to easier and wider spread of the
virus, in particular due to infected individuals with very little symptoms (“spreaders”) and a
long incubation time (up to 3 weeks) combined with viral shedding long before disease onset2.
A vaccine with rapid onset of protection is therefore in high demand for the control of the
pandemic that is currently taking its course.
The spike protein of COVID-19 is highly homologous to the spike protein of SARS and both
viruses share the same receptor, which is angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE2)3,4. The
receptor binding domain (RBD) of the SARS spike protein binds to ACE2 and is an important
target for neutralizing antibodies5-7. By analogy, the RBD of COVID-19 spike protein may be
expected to similarly be the target of neutralizing antibodies, blocking the interaction of the
virus with its receptor. We have previously shown that antigens displayed on virus-like
particles (VLP) induce high levels of antibodies in all species tested, including humans8.
More recently, we have developed an immunologically optimized VLP platform based on
cucumber mosaic virus. These CuMVTT VLPs (hereafter CuMVTT) incorporate a universal T
cell epitope derived from tetanus toxin providing pre-existing T cell help. In addition, during
the production process these VLPs package bacterial RNA which is a ligand for toll-like
receptor 7/8 and serves as potent adjuvants9. Using antigens displayed on these VLPs, it

was possible to induce high levels of specific antibodies in mice, rats, cats, dogs and horses
and treat diseases such as atopic dermatitis in dogs or insect bite hypersensitivity in horses911

. To generate a COVID-19 vaccine candidate, we therefore attempted to display the RBD

domain on CuMVTT (Fig. 1a). To this end we gene-synthesized the COVID-19 RBD domain
and fused it to an Fc molecule for better expression. As expected, the protein bound
efficiently to the viral receptor ACE2 as determined by Sandwich ELISA (Fig. 1b). In a next
step, the protein was chemically coupled to the surface of CuMVTT using the well established
chemical cross-linkers SATA and SMPH (ref. 9). SDS-Page and Western Blotting confirmed
efficient coupling of the RBD-fusion molecule to CuMVTT, resulting in the vaccine candidate
RBD-CuMVTT (Fig. 1c,d).
To test immunogenicity of the vaccine candidate, mice were immunized three times (weekly
schedule) with the RBD-fusion molecule alone or conjugated to the surface of CuMVTT
formulated in Montanide adjuvants. As shown in Fig. 2a-c, coupling to VLPs dramatically
increased the immunogenicity of the RBD. As shown by ELISA on recombinant RBD, RBDCuMVTT showed strongly increased immunogenicity at all time-points tested (one week after
the vaccine injection time-points). To assess the potential for anti-viral activity, we assessed
whether the induced antibodies were able to block binding of the RBD protein to the viral
receptor ACE2. As shown in Fig. 3, immune sera obtained after two boosts (day 21) were
able to strongly inhibit RBD binding to ACE2.
The best correlate of protection is viral neutralization. To this end, we generated
pseudotyped retroviruses12 expressing the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein and luciferase for
quantification of infection (Fig. 4a). Using these viruses, the neutralizing capacity of the sera
from immunized mice was assessed on ACE2-transfected cells (Fig. 4b), directly
demonstrating high anti-viral neutralizing activity of the induced antibodies. Hence, the RBDCuMVTT vaccine candidate is able to induce high levels of SARS-CoV-2 neutralizing
antibodies. Furthermore, the CuMVTT based vaccine is based on highly efficient expression
systems and chemical conjugation technologies, rendering it an attractive candidate for large
scale production under cGMP. Previous studies with a similar VLP-based conjugate vaccine
has demonstrated that high levels of specific antibodies can be mounted within a week13,14
(see also Fig. 2a), offering the additional possibilities to rapidly immunize individuals that
have been exposed to infected humans or those that are kept in quarantine. Thus, vaccines
based on the SARS-CoV-2 RBD domain displayed on VLPs may have the potential to
critically interfere with global spread of the virus.

Methods
Protein expression and purification
The SARS-CoV-2 receptor-binding domain (RBD) and the N-terminal peptidase domain of
human ACE2 were expressed using 293F cells (Invitrogen). The SARS-CoV-2 RBD
(residues Arg319-Phe541) with an N-terminal IL-2 signal peptide for secretion and a Cterminal Fc tag for purification was inserted into pFUSE-mIgG1-Fc2 vector (Invitrogen). The
construct was transformed into bacterial DH5α competent cells, and the extracted plasmid
was then transfected into 293F cells at a density of 3×106 cells/ml using PEI (Invitrogen). The
cell culture supernatant containing the secreted RBD was harvested 96 h after infection,
concentrated and buffer-exchanged to HBS (10 mM HEPES, pH 7.2, 150 mM NaCl). RBD
was captured by protein A resin (GE Healthcare) and eluted with Gly-HCl buffer pH 2.2.
Fractions containing RBD were collected and neutralized to pH 7.0 with 1M Tris. For ELISA
coating, ACE2 was cleaved from the Fc part using thrombin as described in the
manufacturer’s manual.
The human ACE2 (residues Ser19-Ser741) with an N-terminal IL-2 signal peptide for
secretion and a C-terminal 6×His tag for purification was inserted into pFUSE-vector
(Invitrogen). The human ACE2 was expressed by essentially the same protocol used for the
SARS-CoV-2 RBD. ACE2 was captured by Ni-NTA resin (GE Healthcare) and eluted with
500 mM imidazole in HBS buffer. RBD was then purified by gel filtration chromatography
using the Superdex 200 column (GE Healthcare) pre-equilibrated with HBS buffer. Fractions
containing ACE2 were collected.
Serum competitive ELISA
The antibody competitive binding activities of the serum were assayed by ELISA. ACE2
(1ug/ml) was incubated in 96-well plate overnight at 4 °C. After incubation, the plate was
blocked with 2% BSA for 2h at 37°C and then washed ﬁve times with PBS containing 0.05%
Tween 20. BSA was used as negative control followed by the addition of a mixture of 40-fold
diluted serum and RBD-mFc (0.15ug/ml) followed by incubation for 30 min with gentle
shaking at 37°C. Plates were washed five times with PBS containing 0.05% Tween 20 (PBT)
followed by 100 µl of horseradish peroxidase/anti-mFc antibody conjugate (diluted 1:5000 in
PBT buffer), incubated 30 min with gentle shaking. Plates were washed five times PBT buffer
and developed with 100 µl of freshly prepared 3,3’,5,5’-Tetramethylbenzidine (TMB)
substrate. Reaction was stopped with 100 µl of 1.0 M H3PO4 and read spectrophotometrically
at 450 nm in a microtiter plate reader.

Production of CuMVTT VLPs
The production of CuMVTT was described in detail in Zeltins et al.9 Briefly, E coli C2566 cells
(New England Biolabs, Ipswich, Mass) were transformed with the CuMVTT coat protein (CP)
gene–containing plasmid pETCuMVtt. The expression was induced with 0.2 mM isopropyl-βD-thiogalactopyranoside (IPTG). The resulting biomass was collected by low-speed
centrifugation and was frozen at −20°C. After thawing on ice, the cells were suspended in the
buffer containing 50 mM sodium citrate, 5 mM sodium borate, 5 mM EDTA, and 5 mM 2Mercaptoethanol (pH 9.0, buffer A) and were disrupted by ultrasonic treatment. Insoluble
proteins and cell debris were removed by centrifugation (13,000 rpm, 30 minutes at 5°C, JA30.50Ti rotor, Beckman, Palo Alto, Calif). The soluble CuMVTT CP protein in clarified lysate
was pelleted using saturated ammonium sulfate (1:1, vol/vol) overnight at 4°C. Soluble
CuMVTT CP–containing protein solution was separated from the cellular proteins by
ultracentrifugation in a sucrose gradient (20%-60% sucrose; ultracentrifugation at 25,000 rpm
for 6 hours at 5°C [SW28 rotor, Beckman]). After dialysis CuMVTT-containing gradient
fractions, VLPs were concentrated using ultracentrifuge (TLA100.3 rotor, Beckman; at
72,000 rpm for 1 hour, +5°C) or by ultrafiltration using Amicon Ultra 15 (100 kDa; MerckMillipore, Cork, Ireland).
Generation of the RBD-CuMVTT vaccine
The RBD was conjugated to CuMVTT using the cross-linker Succinimidyl 6-(betamaleimidopropionamido) hexanoate (SMPH) (Thermo Fisher Scientific, 10-molar excess, 60
minutes, 23°C). The coupling reactions were performed with 0.3x molar excess of RBD, 0.3x
RBD, or equal molar amount of RBD regarding the CuMVTT (shaking at 23°C for 3 hours at
1200 rpm on DSG Titertek; Flow Laboratories, Irvine, United Kingdom). Unreacted SMPH
and RBD proteins were removed using Amicon-Ultra 0.5, 100K (Merck-Millipore, Burlington,
Mass). VLP samples were centrifuged for 2 minutes at 14,000 rpm for measurement on ND1000. Coupling efficiency was calculated by densitometry (as previously described for IL17ACuMVTT vaccine9), with a result of approximately 20% to 30%.
Mice
BALB/c mice at the age of 6 weeks were purchased from Beijing Vital River Laboratory
Animal Technology Co., Ltd and kept at the animal facility of Anhui Agricultural University. All
animal experiments were performed in accordance with the National Animal Protection
Guidelines and approved by the Chinese Association for Laboratory Animal Sciences.

subcutaneous injection with 50 µg of either RBD-CuMVTT or RBD (CuMVTT injected as
control).The boosts of the vaccination were conducted at the 2nd and 3rd week. Serum was
collected for ELISA analysis 1 week after every vaccination.
Generation of pseudovirus
Pseudovirus expressing the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein was produced by lentivirus secondgeneration packing system15. Plasmids of pwpxl-luc, HIV-1 PSD and pCMV3 containing the
SARS-CoV-2 spike gene were co-transfected into 7 x 105 293LT cells using Sinofection (Sino
Biological). The medium was replaced with fresh DMEM containing 10% FBS after overnight
incubation. Supernatants containing pseudovirus were collected 48 h and 72h after
transfection and filtered using a 0.45-μm filter syringe. All filtered supernatants were collected
together and stored at −80 °C until use.
Titration of pseudovirus
The 293T-ACE2 cells which stably express ACE2 receptors on the cell membrane were
prepared by transfection of ACE2 gene into 293T cells using lentivirus system.
Pseudoviruses prepared above were added to the 293T-ACE2 cells (3 × 104 cells/well) with
100 μl polybrene (16μg/ml). After 48 h, the infection was monitored using the Luciferase
Assay System (Promega). Titer was calculated based on serial dilutions of pseudovirus.
Neutralization assay
The mouse serum samples (2 μl) were diluted to 1:10, 1:40, 1:160, 1:640 and 1:2560
respectively, and then mixed with an equal volume of pseudovirus stock. After incubation at
37°C for 1 h, the mixture was inoculated on the 293T-ACE2 cells (3 x 104 cells/well). At the
same time, pseudovirus+DMEM medium was set as a positive control and DMEM medium
only was set as a negative control. After the cells were incubated for 72 hours, serum
neutralization was measured by luciferase activity of infected pseudovirus. A cut-off of >80%
was used as to determine neutralizing titer.
