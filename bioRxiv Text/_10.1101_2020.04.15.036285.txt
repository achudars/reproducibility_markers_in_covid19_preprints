Abstract:
SARS-CoV-2 is known to infect the neurological, respiratory, enteric, and hepatic systems of
human and has already become an unprecedented threat to global healthcare system. COVID-19,
the most serious public condition caused by SARS-CoV-2 leads the world to an uncertainty
alongside thousands of regular death scenes. Unavailability of specific therapeutics or approved
vaccine has made the recovery of COVI-19 more troublesome and challenging. The present in
silico study aimed to predict a novel chimeric vaccines by simultaneously targeting four major
structural proteins via the establishment of ancestral relationship among different strains of
coronaviruses. Conserved regions from the homologous protein sets of spike glycoprotein (S),
membrane protein (M), envelope protein and nucleocapsid protein (N) were identified through
multiple sequence alignment. The phylogeny analyses of whole genome stated that four proteins
(S, E, M and N) reflected the close ancestral relation of SARS-CoV-2 to SARS-COV-1 and bat
coronavirus. Numerous immunogenic epitopes (both T cell and B cell) were generated from the
common fragments which were further ranked on the basis of antigenicity, transmembrane
topology, conservancy level, toxicity and allergenicity pattern and population coverage analysis.
Top putative epitopes were combined with appropriate adjuvants and linkers to construct a novel
multiepitope subunit vaccine against COVID-19. The designed constructs were characterized
based on physicochemical properties, allergenicity, antigenicity and solubility which revealed the
superiority of construct V3 in terms safety and efficacy. Essential molecular dynamics and
Normal Mode analysis confirmed minimal deformability of the refined model at molecular level.
In addition, disulfide engineering was investigated to accelerate the stability of the protein.
Molecular docking study ensured high binding affinity between construct V3 and HLA cells, as
well as with different host receptors. Microbial expression and translational efficacy of the
constructs were checked using pET28a(+) vector of E. coli strain K12. The development of
preventive measures to combat COVID-19 infections might be aided the present study.
However, the in vivo and in vitro validation might be ensured with wet lab trials using model
animals for the implementation of the presented data.

1. Introduction
Novel coronavirus named SARS-CoV-2/ 2019-nCoV was identified at the end of 2019 in
Wuhan, a city in the Hubei province of China, causing severe pneumonia that leads to huge
death cases (Wang et al., 2020). Gradually this virus emerged as a new threat to the whole world
and affecting almost all parts of the world. To date, the pathogen has affected 198 countries, and
thus becoming a global public health emergency. Global public health concern with pandemic
notion of COVID-19 was declared on January 30th, 2020 by the World health organization
(WHO, 2020). Agin, an adverse situation has also been announced on 13 March 2020 for
increasing the infections of COVID-19 (Kunz and Minder, 2020). Till April 10, 2020, total virus
affected people around the world exceeded 1,633,272 and more than 97,601 committed death,
while 366,610 people fully recovered from the infection (WHO, 2020). The alarming situation is
that the number of confirmed cases worldwide has exceeded one million by this time. It took
more than three months to reach the first 10000 confirmed cases, while required only 12 days to
detect the next 100000 cases. The situation is getting worse in European region. Total death
cases in Italy, Spain, USA, France, United Kingdom was 14681,11744,7847,6507 and 4313
respectively (till April 4, 2020) and this number is exacerbating day by day (WHO, 2020).
Some common clinical manifestations of COVID-19 is fever, sputum production, shortness of
breath, cough, fatigue, sore throat and headache which leads to severe cases of pneumonia. A
few patients also have gastrointestinal symptoms with diarrhea and vomiting (Guan et al., 2019).
Though several early studies showed that the mortality rate for SARS-CoV-2 is not as high (23%), the latest global death rate for COVID-19 is 3.4% which indicates the increasing trends
(Wu et al., 2020). The investigation of Chinese Center for Diseases Control and Prevention
(2020) revealed that the prevalence of COVID-19 is more apparent in the people ages 50 years
rather than the lower age groups (Jeong-ho et al., 2020). High fever and Lymphocytopenia were
found more common in Covid-19, though the frequency of the patient without fever condition is
also higher than in the earlier outbreaks caused by SARS-CoV (1%) and MERS-CoV (2%)
(Huang et al., 2020; Chen et al., 2020).
SARS-CoV-2 is a betacoronavirus that has a positive sense, 26-32 kb in length, single stranded
RNA molecule as its genetic material and belongs to the family Coronaviridae, order Nidovirales
(Hui et al., 2019). It shares genome similarity with SARS-CoV (79.5%) and bat coronavirus

(96%) (Zhou et al., 2020; Zhu et al., 2020). However, there are still obscured hypothesis
regarding the vector or carrier of SARS-CoV-2, though its detection was primarily linked to
Wuhan's Huanan Seafood wholesale market (Lu et al., 2020; WHO, 2020). Though the species
of SARS-CoV-1 and bat coronavirus shares sufficient sequence similarities with the COVID-19,
the known way mechanism of infection to the host, and the death rate is quite different in case of
the novel coronavirus. In addition, there is an evolutionary distance between SARS-CoV-1 and
bat coronavirus as well as the COVID-19 (Hu et al., 2018; Wu et al., 2020; Wu, 2020b). Because
of high sequence variability of the pathogen, many of the efforts that have been undertaken to
develop vaccine against SARS-CoV2, remain unsuccessful (Graham et al., 2013). Therefore,
there is an urgent need to develop vaccines for treatment of SARS-CoV-2 based on the
understanding of actual evolutionary ancestral relationship. While some natural metabolites and
traditional medication may come up with comfort and take the edge off few symptoms of
COVID-19, there is no proof that existing treatment procedures can effectively combat against
the diseased condition (WHO, 2020). However, inactivated or live-attenuated forms of
pathogenic organisms are usually recommended for the initiation of antigen-specific responses
that alleviate or reduce the possibility of host experience with secondary infections (Thompson
& Staats, 2011). Moreover, all of the proteins are not usually targeted for protective immunity,
whereas only a few numbers of proteins are necessary depending on the microbes (Tesh et al.,
200, Li et al., 2014). Depending on sufficient antigen expression from experimental assays,
traditional vaccine could take 15 years to develop, while sometimes can lead to undesirable
consequences (Purcell et al., 2007, Petrovsky & Aguilar, 2004).

Reverse vaccinology approach, on the other hand, is an effective way to develop vaccine against
COVID-19. In this method, computation analysis towards genomic architecture of pathogenic
candidate could predict the antigens of pathogens without the prerequisite to culture the
pathogens in lab condition. Although, few pathogens that challenge to develop effective vaccines
so far may become possible through such approach (Rappuoli, 2000) which initiates a huge
move in the development of vaccine against the deadly pathogens. The strategy included the
comprehensive utilization of bioinformatics algorithm or tools to develop epitope based vaccine
molecules, though further validation and experimental procedures are also needed (Moxon et al.,

bioRxiv preprint doi: https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.04.15.036285; this version posted April 15, 2020. The copyright holder for this preprint (which

2019). In addition, peptide based subunit vaccines are biologically safer due to the absence of
continuous in vitro culture during the production period, and also implies an appropriate
activation of immune responses (Purcell et al., 2007; Dudek et al., 2010). Such
immunoinformatic approaches have already been employed by the researchers to design vaccines
against a number of deadly pathogens including Ebola virus (Khan et al., 2015), HIV (Pandey et
al., 2018), Areanaviruses (Azim et al., 2019a), Marburgvirus (Hasan et al., 2019a), Norwalk
virus (Azim et al., 2019b), Nipah virus (Saha et al., 2017), influenza virus (Hasan et al., 2019b)
and so on. At present, a suitable peptide vaccine against SARS-CoV-2 is urgently necessary that
could efficiently generate enough immune response to destroy the virus. Hence, the study was
designed to develop a chimeric recombinant vaccine against COVID-19 by targeting four major
structural proteins of the pathogen, while revealing the evolutionary history of different species
of coronavirus based on whole genome and protein domain-based phylogeny.

2. Materials and Methods

2.1. Data Acquisition
Complete Genomes of the COVID-19 and other coronaviruses were retrieved from the NCBI
(https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/), using the keyword ‘coronavirus’ and the search option
‘nucleotide’. A total 61 complete genomes were retrieved, with unique identity (Supplementary
File 1). Protein sequence of the spike, envelope, membrane and nucleocapsid were also retrieved
from the corresponding genome sequences found in NCBI (Supplementary File 1).

2.2. Phylogeny construction and visualization
Tthe complete genome sequences of coronaviruses and the proteins of envelope, envelope,
membrane and nucleocapsid were employed to construct different phylogenetic trees. Multiple
sequence alignment (MSA) of the complete genome and protein sequences were performed using
MAFFT v7.310 (Katoh & Standley, 2013) tool. For the whole genome alignment, we used
MAFFT Auto algorithm, while for the protein sequences alignment, MAFFT G-INS-I algorithm

was used using default parameters. Next, alignment was visualized using the JalView-2.11
(Waterhouse et al., 2009). Alignment position with more than 50% gaps was pruned from
coronavirus genome using Phyutility 2.2.6 program (Smith & Dunn, 2008). Again, more than
20% gaps from the spike protein alignment was removed. PartitionFinder-2.1.1 (Lanfear et al.,
2017) indicated the best fit substitution model of the completed genome sequences and the
protein sequences. The phylogeny of the whole genome sequences of coronavirus was
constructed using both the Maximum Likelihood Method and Bayesian Method. RAxML version
8.2.11 (Stamatakis, 2014) with the substitution model GTRGAMMAI was used using 1000
rapid bootstrap replicates. MrBayes version 3.2.6 (Ronquist et al., 2012) with INVGAMMA
model was used for the corona virus genomes. Phylogenetic analyses of four different protein
sequences were performed by using RAxML-8.2.11 tool. For spike and nucleocapsid proteins,
we found PROTGAMMAIWAG and PROTGAMMAIWAG as the best fil model, respectively.
Again, PROTGAMMAWAG was the best fit model of evolution for both the membrane and
envelope proteins. For the retrieval of the domain sequences of the stated protein sequences,
InterPro database (https://www.ebi.ac.uk/interpro/) was utilized. Finally, the Interactive Tree of
Life (iTOL; EMBL, Heidelberg, Germany) was used for the visualization of the phylogenetic
trees. All the trees were rooted in the midpoint.

2.3. Identification of conserved regions as vaccine target
In the present study, reverse vaccinology technique was utilized to model a novel multiepitope
subunit vaccine against 2019-nCoV. The scheme in Figure 1 represents the complete
methodology that has been adopted to develop the final vaccine construct. Among 496 proteins
(available in the NCBI database) from different strains of novel corona virus, four structural
proteins, i.e. spike glycoprotein, membrane glycoprotein, envelope protein and nucleocapsid
protein, were prioritized for further investigation (Supplementary File 2). After sequence
retrieval from NCBI, the sequences were subjected to BLASTp analysis to find out the
homologous protein sequences. Multiple sequence alignment was done by using Clustal Omega
to identify the conserved regions (Sievers and Higgins, 2014). The topology of each conserved
regions were predicted by TMHMM Server v.2.0 (http://www.cbs.dtu.dk/services/TMHMM/),

bioRxiv preprint doi: https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.04.15.036285; this version posted April 15, 2020. The copyright holder for this preprint (which

while the antigenicity of the conserved regions was determined by VaxiJen v2.0 (Doytchinova
and Flower, 2007a).

2.4. T-cell epitope prediction, transmembrane topology screening and antigenicity analysis
Only the common fragments were used for T-Cell epitopes enumeration via T-Cell epitope
prediction server of IEDB (http://tools.iedb.org/main/tcell/) (Vita et al., 2014). Again, TMHMM
server was utilized for the prediction of transmembrane topology of predicted MHC-I and MHCII binding peptides followed by antigenicity scoring via VaxiJen v2.0 server (Krogh et al., 2001;
Doytchinova and Flower, 2007b). The epitopes which have antigenic potency were picked and
used for preceding analysis.

2.5. Conservancy analysis and toxicity profiling of the predicted epitopes
The level of conservancy scrutinizes the ability of epitope candidates to impart capacious
spectrum immunity. Homologous sequence sets of the chosen antigenic proteins were retrieved
form the NCBI database by utilizing BLASTp tool. Later, conservancy analysis tool
(http://tools.iedb.org/conservancy/) in IEDB was used to demonstrate the conservancy level of
the predicted epitopes among different viral starins. The toxicity of non-allergenic epitopes was
enumerated by using ToxinPred server (Gupta et al., 2013).

2.6. Population coverage and allergenicity pattern of putative epitopes
Among different ethnic societies and geographic spaces, the HLA distribution varies around the
world. Population coverage study was conducted by using IEDB population coverage calculation
server (Vita et al., 2014). To check the allergenicity of the proposed epitopes, four distinct
servers i.e. AllergenFP (Dimitrov et al., 2014), AllerTOP (Dimitrov et al., 2013), Allermatch
(Fiers et al., and Allergen Online (http://www.allergenonline.org/) servers were utilized.

2.7. Identification of B-Cell epitopes
Three different algorithms i.e. Bepipred Linear Epitope Prediction 2.0 (Jespersen et al., 2017),
Emini surface accessibility prediction (Emini et al., 1985) and Kolaskar and Tongaonkar
antigenicity scale (Kolaskar and Tongaonkar, 1990) from IEDB predicted the potential B-Cell
epitopes within conserved fragments of the chosen viral proteins.

2.8. Construction of vaccine molecules and prediction of allergenicity, antigenicity and
solubility of the constructs
Top CTL, HTL and B cell epitopes were compiled to design the final vaccine constructs in the
study. Each vaccine constructs commenced with an adjuvant followed by top CTL epitopes,
HTL epitopes and BCL epitopes respectively. For construction of novel corona vaccine, the
chosen adjuvants i.e. L7/L12 ribosomal protein, beta defensin (a 45 mer peptide) and HABA
protein (M. tuberculosis, accession number: AGV15514.1) were used (Rana and Akhter, 2016).
Several linkers such as EAAAK, GGGS, GPGPG and KK in association with PADRE sequence
were incorporated to construct fruitful vaccine sequences against COVID-19. The constructed
vaccines were then analyzed whether they are non-allergenic by utilizing the following tool
named Algpred (Azim et al., 2019). The most potential vaccine among the three constructs was
then determined by assessing the antigenicity and solubility of the vaccines via VaxiJen v2.0
(Doytchinova and Flower, 2007b) and Proso II server (Smialowski et al., 2006), respectively.

2.9. Physicochemical characterization and secondary structure analysis
ProtParam tool (https://web.expasy.org/protparam/), provided by ExPASy server (Hasan et al.,
2019c) was used to functionally characterize (Gasteiger et al., 2003) the vaccine constructs. The
studied functional properties were isoelectric pH, molecular weight, aliphatic index, instability
index, hydropathicity, estimated half-life, GRAVY values and other physicochemical
characteristics. Alpha helix, beta sheet and coil structures of the vaccine constructs were
analyzed through GOR4 secondary structure prediction method using Prabi (https://npsaprabi.ibcp.fr/). In addition, Espript 3.0 (Robert & Gouet, 2014) was also used to predict the
secondary structure of the stated protein sequences.

2.10. Homology modeling, structure refinement, validation and disulfide engineering
Vaccine 3D model was generated on the basis of percentage similarity between target protein
and available template structures from PDB by using I-TASSER (Peng and Xu, 2011). The
modeled structures were further refined via FG-MD refinement server. Structure validation was
performed by Ramachandran plot assessment in RAMPAGE (Hasan et al., 2019b). By utilizing
DbD2 server, probable disulfide bonds were designed for the anticipated vaccine constructs
(Craig and Dombkowski, 2013). The value of energy was considered < 2.5, while the chi3 value
for the residue screening was chosen between –87 to +97 for the operation (Hasan et al., 2019b).

2.11. Conformational B-cell and IFN-α inducing epitopes prediction
The B-cell epitopes of putative vaccine molecules were predicted via ElliPro server
(http://tools.iedb.org/ellipro/) with minimum score 0.5 and maximum distance of 7 Å
(Ponomarenko et al., 2004). Moreover, IFN- inducing epitopes within the vaccine were predicted
using IFNepitope with motif and SVM hybrid detection strategy (Hajighahramani et al., 2017).

2.12. Molecular dynamics and normal mode analysis (NMA)
Normal mode analysis (NMA) was performed to predict the stability and large scale mobility of
the vaccine protein. The iMod server determined the stability of construct V3 by comparing the
essential dynamics to the normal modes of protein (Aalten et al, 1997; Wuthrich et al., 1980). It
is a recommended alternative to costly atomistic simulation (Tama and Brooks, 2006; Cui and
Bahar, 2007) and shows much quicker and efficient assessments than the typical molecular
dynamics (MD) simulations tools (Prabhakar et al., 2016; Awan et al., 2017). The main-chain
deformability was also predicted by measuring the efficacy of target molecule to deform at each
of its residues. The motion stiffness was represented via eigenvalue, while the covariance matrix
and elastic network model was also analyzed.

available under aCC-BY 4.0 International license.

2.13. Protein-protein interaction study
Patchdock server was prioritized for docking between different HLA alleles and the putative
vaccine molecules. In addition, the superior construct was also docked with different human
immune receptors such as, ACE 3, APN, DPP4 and TLR-8.The 3D structure of these receptors
were retrieved from RCSB protein data bank. Detection of highest binding affinity between the
putative vaccine molecules and the receptor was experimented based on the lowest interaction
energy of the docked structure.

2.14. Codon adaptation and in silico cloning
JCAT tool was utilized for codon adaptation in order to fasten the expression of vaccine
construct V3 in E. coli strain K12. For this, some restriction enzymes (i.e. BglI and BglII), Rho
independent transcription termination and prokaryote ribosome-binding site were put away from
the work (Grote et al., 2005). After that, the mRNA sequence of constructed V3 vaccine was
ligated within BglI (401) and BglII (2187) restriction site at the C-terminal and N-terminal sites
respectively. SnapGene tool was utilized for in silico restriction cloning (Solanki and Tiwari,
2018).

3. Results

3.1. COVID-19 exhibits close ancestral relation to SARS-CoV-1 and bat-coronavirus
In the phylogenetic analysis, we introduced different coronavirus from three different genera:
Alpha coronavirus, Beta coronavirus and Gamma coronavirus. Total 61 species of the corona
virus covered 21 sub-genera (Supplementary Table 1 and Figure 2). These 61 species of corona
viruses included 7 pathogenic species (Figure 2), which are: COVID-19 or SARS-CoV-2, SARSCoV-1 virus, MERS virus, HCoV-HKU1, HCoV-OC43, HCoV-NL63, HCoV-229E (Forni et al.,
2017; Zhou et al., 2020; Zumla et al., 2016). Among these, the first five species belong to the
beta coronavirus genera, while the last two belongs to the alpha genera. Apart from the human

coronaviruses, we introduced other coronaviruses which choose different species of bats, whale,
turkey, rat, mink, ferret, swine, camel, rabbit, cow and others as host (Supplementary Table-1).
The phylogeny of these species clearly revealed two broad clades (Figure 2), where first large
clade contains Gammacoronavirus and Alphacoronavirus genera, while the other belongs to the
Betacoronavirus. Within the Betacoronavirus clade, we found three clear divisions. HCoVHKU1 and HCoV-OC43 have been placed in the first clade, while in the second clade we found
MERS coronavirus. COVID-19 or SARS-COV-2 formed clade with SARS-COV-1 and bat
betacoronaviruses (Figure 2), which is consistent with the previous finding (Ceraolo & Giorgi,
2020). Though SARS-CoV-1 belongs to the same sub-genus as the COVID-19, the bat
coronaviruses belong to two different sub-genera including Hibecovirus and Nobecovirus
(Supplementary File 1).

3.2. Evolution of spike proteins based on domain
Domain analysis of spike protein of coronaviruses reveals that they contain mainly one signature
domains namely, coronavirus S2 glycoprotein (IPR002552), which is present in all the
candidates. All other betacoronavirus contains spike receptor binding protein (IPR018548),
coronavirus spike glycoprotein hapted receptor 2 domain (IPR027400) and spike receptor
binding domain superfamily (IPR036326). SARS-CoV-1 contains an extra domain, namely spike
glycoprotein N-terminal domain (IPR032500), which is also present in some the sub-genera
(Embecovirus) of Betacoronavirus, but not in COVID-19. One important finding in our study is
that the COVID-19 candidates do not contain the domain spike glycoprotein (IPR042578), which
is present in the SARS-CoV-1 (Figure 3). The secondary structure prediction study shows a large
numbers of cysteine residues which contribute to the formation of disulfide bonds within the
spike protein. Most of them fall within the S1 spike protein, which is 654 amino acid long in
SARS-CoV-1, while 672 amino acids long in COVID-19. The RGD motif which is conserved
within the COVID-19 is present in the vicinity of the S1 protein. It exists as KGD that clearly
demonstrates the mutation over the short time period. Again, the receptor binding domain and
receptor binding motif analyses disclose variations within several region between the COVID19
and SARS-CoV-1 (Supplementary File 2). The domain-based phylogenetic analysis reflects two
main divisions, where the all the novel betacoronavirus i.e., COVID19 form clade with the

SARS-CoV-1; while other betacoronavirus fall in another clade which further divide to give rise
different sub-genera. This clearly shows that the COVID-19 exerts specific ancestral connection
to the SARS-CoV-1 in terms of spike glycoproteins. Interestingly, our study also revealed close
relatedness of both the SARS-CoV-1 and COVID-19 to the bat betacoronavirus that belongs to
the Hibecovirus sub-genus. However, in our study, the bat coronaviruses of Nobecovirus subgenus did not fall into the same clade of novel coronaviruses. The phylogenetic study and MSA
also revealed that, the functional portion of the spike glycoprotein domain and spike glycoprotein
N-terminal domain might be lost from the COVID-19 during the course of evolution.

3.3. Domain architecture and ancestral state of envelope proteins
The envelope proteins of both Betacoronavirus and Alphacoronavirus contain only one protein
domain (IPR003873) namely, Nonstructural protein NS3 or small envelope protein E (NS3/E).
This domain is well conserved in coronavirus and also found in murine hepatitis virus. On the
other hands, the gamma coronavirus shows the exception, which possess (IPR005296) IBV3C
protein domain, which thought to be expressed from the ORF3C gene of infectious bronchitis
virus (Jia & Naqi, 1997) (Supplementary File 1 and 2). The length of the domains for the
COVID-19, SARS-CoV and MARS virus are 75, 76 and 82 amino acids, respectively. While, the
length of the gamma coronavirus candidate in our study, which utilizes turkey as host is 99
amino acids.
The average length of the COVID-19 envelope proteins is 75 amino acid long. The NS3/E
protein domains spans the whole length of the protein and possess mainly one transmembrane
domain, one non-cytoplasmic domain and a cytoplasmic domain. However, some species from
the sub-genera of Embecovirus shows two transmembrane domains (Figure 4, Supplementary
File 1 and 2). While in our in-silico study, we found 2 transmembrane domains in SARS-CoV-1
and 2-3 transmembrane domains in MERS virus, previous experiments proved that both contains
only one α-helical transmembrane domains (Nieto-Torres et al., 2011; Surya et al., 2015).
Though the computational analysis of CoVID-19 envelope protein secondary structure shows 2
transmembrane domains, our domain analysis shows only one such domain in their structures.
Again, the Turkey corona virus also possess the same transmembrane, non-cytoplasmic domain
and cytoplasmic domain, with a variation in the orientation. The domain-based phylogeny of the

envelope proteins of novel corona viruses reveals close ancestral relationship with the SARSCoV-1 and bat coronaviruses (Figure 4). In spite to the previous findings, where it was found
that the envelope proteins of the MERS virus and SARS-CoV-1 exerted close proximity in terms
of secondary structure and functions (Surya et al., 2015). Unlike to earlier finding, we got that
gamma corona virus candidate in our study shows close connection with both SARS-CoV-1 and
COVID-19 in terms of envelope proteins.

3.4. Domain architecture and phylogeny of membrane proteins
Membrane proteins of all the coronavirus mainly contain coronavirus M matrix/glycoprotein
(IPR002574) domain family. However, the candidates of alpha and gamma coronaviruses
contain M matrix/glycoprotein: Alpha coronavirus (IPR042551) and M matrix/glycoprotein:
Gamma coronavirus (IPR042550) domains, respectively. The next two domains belong to the M
matrix/glycoprotein domain family. The membrane proteins of coronaviruses ranges from 221 to
230 amino acid long. Computational analysis of secondary structures shows some variations of
COVID-19 with SARS-CoV-1 and MERS virus (Supplementary File 3). COVID-19 possess
alpha helical structure in their structure, while the other two completely devoid of this structure.
Again, both SARS-CoV-1 and MARS contain parallel beta sheets, while it is completely absent
in the novel corona virus (Supplementary File 3). The phylogenetic analysis of the membrane
supports that the novel coronavirus is closely connected to the SARS-CoV-1 virus membrane
protein. As well as it produced connections with bat coronaviruses of Hibecovirus and
Nobecovirus sub-genus (Figure 5).

3.5. Domain-based phylogeny of nucleocapsid proteins
The length of nucleocapsid proteins of betacoronavirus genus ranges from 410 to 450 amino
acids. Three signature domains are mainly present in the nucleocapsid proteins, which are:
Coronavirus Nucleocapsid protein (IPR001218), Nucleocapsid Proteins C-terminal (IPR037179)
and Nucleocapsid Proteins N-terminal (IPR037195). However, in our experiment, we didn’t find
these domains in HCoV-HKU1 (Figure 6); this virus belongs to Embecovirus sub-genus and
contains only Coronavirus Nucleocapsid I (IPR004876) domain. The candidates of alpha and
gamma coronavirus have their special domains. According to our domain-based phylogeny study

of nucleocapsid proteins, we found the close approximation of the COVID-19 with the SARSCoV-1, which is consistent with the findings of phylogeny of whole genome. Strikingly, unlike
spike and membrane proteins, the closest homologs of COVID-19 are not only the SARS-COV-1
and bat coronaviruses (Sub-genus: Hibecovirus and Nobecovirus), but it also includes the MERS
viruses and other proteins which is from the Merbecovirus sub-genus.

3.6. Identification of conserved regions as vaccine target
A total 31, 24, 29 and 29 sequences of spike glycoprotein, membrane glycoprotein, envelope
protein and nucleocapsid protein were retrieved from the NCBI database belonging to different
strains of SARS-CoV-2. Following by BLASTp analysis and Multiple Sequence Alignment, two
conserved regions were detected for membrane glycoprotein and nucleocapsid, while single
fragments were identified for both spike glycoprotein and envelope protein (Table 1). Results
showed that, all the conserved sequences except one from membrane glycoprotein met the
criteria of default threshold standard in VaxiJen. Again, transmembrane topology scrutinizing
showed that among the immunogenic conserved sequences from the corresponding proteins
except spike glycoprotein met the criteria of desired exomembrane characteristics (Table 1).

3.7. T-cell epitope prediction, transmembrane topology screening and antigenicity analysis
A plethora of immunogenic epitopes were generated from the conserved sequences that were
able to bind with most noteworthy number of HLA cells (Supplementary Table 1, Supplementary
Table 2, Supplementary Table 3 and Supplementary Table 4). Top epitopes with exomembrane
characteristics were ranked for each individual protein after investigating their antigenicity score
and transmembrane topology (Table 2).

3.8. Conservancy analysis, toxicity profiling, population coverage and allergenicity pattern of
the predicted epitopes
Epitopes from each protein showed high level of conservancy up to 100% (Table 2). ToxinPred
server predicted the relative toxicity of each epitope which indicated that the top epitopes were
non-toxin in nature (Supplementary Table 5). Population coverage of four structures proteins

were also done for the predicted CTL and HTL epitopes. From the screening, results showed that
population of the various geographic regions could be covered by the predicted T-cell epitopes
(Figure 7). Finally, the allergenic epitopes were excluded from the list based on the evaluation of
four allergenicity prediction server (Supplementary Table 5).

3.9. Identification of B cell epitopes
Top B-cell epitopes were predicted for Spike glycoprotein, membrane glycoprotein, envelope
protein and nucleocapsid protein using 3 distinct algorithms (i.e. Bepipred Linear Epitope
prediction, Emini Surface Accessibility, Kolaskar & Tongaonkar Antigenicity prediction) from
IEDB. Epitopes were also allowed to analyze their vaxijen scoring and allergenicity (Table 3).

3.10. Construction of vaccine molecules and prediction of allergenicity, antigenicity and
solubility of the constructs
Three putative vaccine molecules (i.e. V1, V2 and V3) were constructed, each comprising a
protein adjuvant, eight T-cell epitopes, twelve B-cell epitopes and respective linkers
(Supplementary Table 6). PADRE sequence was included to extend the efficacy and potency of
the constructed vaccine. The putative vaccine constructs, V1, V2 and V3 were 397, 481 and 510
residues long respectively. However, allergenicity score of V3 (-0.89886723) revealed that it was
superior among the three constructs in terms safety and efficacy. V3 also had a solubility score
(0.60) (Figure 8E) and antigenicity (0.58) over threshold value (Table 4).

3.11. Physicochemical characterization and secondary structure analysis of the construct
ProtParam tool was employed to analyze the physicochemical properties of V3. Molecular
weight of 3 was scored as 55.181 kDa. The extinction coefficient of V3 was calculated as 63830
at 0.1% absorption. It had been found that the protein would have net negative charge which was
higher than the recommended pI 9.81. Aliphatic index and GRAVY value were found 77.80 and
-0.383 respectively, which could express the thermostability and hydrophilic status of the V3
vaccine construct. Around sixty minutes in vitro half-life stability in mammalian reticulocytes
was predicted for V3. The computed instability index (II) 36.98 classified the protein as a stable

one. In contrast, Secondary structure of V3 exhibited to have 46.47% alpha helix, 15.00% sheet
and 38.63% coil structure (Supplementary Figure 1).

3.12. Homology modeling, structure refinement, validation and disulfide engineering
Tertiary structure of the putative vaccine construct V3 was generated using I-TASSER server
(Figure 8A and 8B). The server used 10 best templates with highest significant (measured via Zscore) from the LOMETS threading program to model the 3D structure. After refinement,
Ramachandran plot analysis revealed that 92.7% and 5.7% residues were in the favored and allowed
regions respectively, while only 8 residues (1.6%) occupied in the outlier region (Figure 8C). The
overall quality factor determined by ERRAT server was 91.56% (Figure 8D). 3D modelled structure
of V1 and V2 are shown in Supplementary Figure 2. DbD2 server recognized 33 pairs of amino acid
residue with the potentiality to create disulfide bond between them. After analysis chi3 and B-factor
parameter of residue pairs on the basis of energy, only 2 pairs (PRO 277-THR 329 and LEU 425CYS 435) met the criteria for disulfide bond formation which were changed with cysteine
(Supplementary Figure 3).

3.13. Conformational B-cell and IFN- inducing epitopes prediction
Ellipro server predicted a total 6 conformational B-cell epitopes from the 3D structure of the
construct V3. Epitopes No. 1 were considered as the broadest conformational B cell epitopes
with 25 amino acid residues (Figure 9 and Supplementary Table 7). Results also revealed that
predicted linear epitopes from 76-101, 131-143 and 48-55 were included in the conformational
B-cell epitopes. Moreover, the sequence of the final vaccine was scanned for 15-mer IFNinducing epitopes. Results showed that there were 292 positive IFN- inducing epitopes from
which 20 had a score ≥5 (Supplementary Table 8). Residues of 194-209 regions
(GGGSLVIGAVILRGG) in the vaccine showed highest score of 17. (Supplementary Table 8).

3.14. Molecular dynamics and normal mode analysis
Stability of the vaccine construct V3 was investigated through mobility analysis (Figure 10A and
10B), B-factor, eigenvalue & deformability analysis, covariance map and recommended elastic

bioRxiv preprint doi: https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.04.15.036285; this version posted April 15, 2020. The copyright holder for this preprint (which

network model. Results revealed that the placements of hinges in the chain was insignificant
(Figure 10C) and the B-factor column gave an averaged RMS (Figure 10D). The estimated higher
eigenvalue 6.341333e-06 (Figure 10E) indicated low chance of deformation of vaccine protein
V3. The correlation matrix and elasticity of the construct have been shown in Figure 10G and
Figure 10H, respectively.

3.15. Protein-protein docking
The structural interaction between HLA alleles and the designed vaccines were investigated by
molecular docking approach. The server detected the complexed structure by focusing on
complementarity score, ACE (Atomic Contact Energy) and estimated interface area of the
compound (Table 5). The molecular affinity between the putative vaccine molecules V3 and several
immune receptors were also experimented. The result showed that construct V3 interacted with each
receptor with significantly lower binding energy (Figure 11).

3.16. Codon adaptation and in silico cloning
The Codon Adaptation Index (CAI) and GC content for the predicted codons of the putative vaccine
constructs V1 were demonstrated as 1.0 and 51.56% respectively. An insert of 1542 bp was found
which lacked the restriction sites for BglI and BglII, thus providing comfort zone for cloning. The
codons were inserted into pET28a(+) vector alongside two restriction sites (BglI and BglII) and a
clone of 5125 base pair was generated (Figure 12).

4. Discussion
In December 2019, a new coronavirus prevalence flourished in Wuhan, China, causing clutter
among the medical community, as well as to the rest of the world (Sun et al., 2020). The new
species has been renamed as 2019-nCoV or, SARS-CoV-2, already causing considerable number
infections and deaths in China, Italy, Spain, Iran, USA and to a growing degree throughout the
world. The major outbreak and spread of SARS-CoV-2 in 2020 forced the scientific community
to make considerable investment and research activity for developing a vaccine against the

bioRxiv preprint doi: https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.04.15.036285; this version posted April 15, 2020. The copyright holder for this preprint (which

pathogen. However, owing to high infectivity and pathogenicity, the culture of SARS-CoV-2
needs biosafety level 3 conditions, which may obstructed the rapid development of any vaccine
or therapeutics. It had been found that about 35 companies and academic institutions are engaged
in such works (Spinney et al., 2020, Ziady et al., 2020). Among the potential SARS-CoV-2
vaccines in the pipeline, four have nucleic acid based designs, four involve non-replicating
viruses or protein constructs, two contain live attenuated virus and one involves a viral vector
(Pang et al., 2020), while only one, called mRNA-1273 (developed by NIAID collaboration with
Moderna, Inc.), has confirmed to start phase-1 trial (NIH, 2020). However, in this study we
emphasized on a different approaches by prioritizing the advantages of different genome and
proteome database using the immunoinformatic approach. Computational vaccine predictions
were adopted by the researchers to design vaccines against both MERS-CoV (Sudhakar et al.,
2013; Fernando et al., 2013) and SARS-CoV-1 (Yang et al., 2003; Oany et al., 2014), targeting
the outer membrane or functional proteins (Sharmin and Islam, 2014). Several in silico strategies
have also been employed to predict potential T cell and B cell epitopes against SARS-CoV-2,
either emphasizing on spike glycoprotein or envelope proteins (Behbahani, 2020; Rasheed et al.,
2020). None of the studies, however, focused on other structural proteins. Moreover, random
genetic changes and mutations in the protein sequences (Yin, 2020) may obstruct the
development of effective vaccines and therapeutics against human coronavirus in the future.
Hence, the present study was employed to identify the similarity and divergence among the close
relatives of the target pathogen and develop a novel chimeric recombinant vaccine considering
all major structural proteins i.e. spike glycoprotein, membrane glycoprotein, envelope protein
and nucleocapsid protein simultaneously.
The topology of the phylogenetic trees of the whole genome and the stated four proteins
sequences from different species of coronaviruses reveal that SARS-CoV-1 and bat
coronaviruses are the closest homologs of the novel coronaviruses. Our results infer a significant
level of similarities within the COVID-19 and SARS-CoV-1 which was also aligned with the
previous findings (Jaimes et al., 2020; Sun et al., 2020; Wu, 2020a). The sequence similarities
between the SARS-CoV, bat coronaviruses and the COVID-19 from the reported studies (Hu et
al., 2018; Wu et al., 2020; Wu, 2020b) suggests that those are distantly related, in spite those are
capable of infecting the humans and therefore possess the adaptive convergent evolution.
Interestingly, the COVID-19 envelope proteins form clade with the Turkey coronavirus which

bioRxiv preprint doi: https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.04.15.036285; this version posted April 15, 2020. The copyright holder for this preprint (which

belongs to Gamma coronavirus genus. So, in terms of envelope proteins, the envelope gene of
turkey coronavirus might contribute to the convergence process, which need further analysis. In
addition, from the domain-based phylogeny of nucleocapsid proteins, it can be deduced that this
protein might have originated in bats and was transmitted to camels and then later on choose
human as the potential host. Overall, the COVID-19 might go through complex adaptation
strategies in order to be transmitted into the human via different animals.
The homologous protein sets for four structural proteins of Coronavirus were sorted to identify
conserved regions through BLASTp analysis and MSA. Only the conserved sequences were
utilized to identify potential B-cell and T-cell epitopes for each individual protein (Table 1).
Thus, our constructs are expected to stimulate a broad-spectrum immunity in host upon
administration. Cytotoxic CD8+T lymphocytes (CTL) play a crucial role to control the spread of
pathogens by recognizing and killing diseased cells or by means of antiviral cytokine secretion
(Garcia et al., 1999). Thus, T cell epitope-based vaccination is a unique process to confer
defensive response against pathogenic candidates (Shrestha, 2004). Approximately 800 MHC-I
peptides (CTL epitopes) and 600 MHC-II peptides (HTL epitopes) were predicted via IEDB
server, from which we screened the top ones through analyzing the antigenicity score, transmembrane topology, conservancy level and other important physiochemical parameters
employing a number of bioinformatics tools (Table 2). The top 10 epitopes from each protein
was further assessed by investigating the toxicity profile and allergenicity pattern. Different
servers rely on different parameters to predict the allergenic nature of small peptides. Therefore,
we used 4 distinct servers for such assessment and the epitopes predicted as non-allergen at least
via 3 servers were retained for further analysis (Supplementary Table 5). Vaccine initiates the
generation of effective antibodies that are usually produced by B cells and plays effector
functions by targeting specifically to a foreign particles (Cooper & Nemerow, 1984). The
potential B cell epitopes were generated by three different algorithms (Bepipred linear epitope
prediction 2.0, Kolaskar and Tongaonkar antigenicity prediction and Emini surface accessibility
prediction) from IEDB database (Table 3).

Suitable linkers and adjuvants were used to combine top finalized epitopes from each protein that
led to develop a multi epitope vaccine molecules (Supplementary Table 6).

As PADRE

bioRxiv preprint doi: https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.04.15.036285; this version posted April 15, 2020. The copyright holder for this preprint (which

sequence was usually recommended to lessen the polymorphism of HLA molecules in the
population (Ghaffari-Nazari et al., 2015), it was also considered to construct the final vaccine
molecule. Here, adjuvants would enhance the immunogenicity of the vaccine constructs and
appropriate separation of epitopes in the host environment would be ensured by the linker (Yang
et al., 2015). Allergenicity, physiochemical properties, antigenicity and three-dimensional
structure of vaccine constructs were characterized, and it had been concluded that V3 was
superior to V1 and V2 vaccine constr. The final construct also occupied by several interferon-α
producing epitopes (Supplementary Table 8). The vaccine protein (V3) was subjected to disulfide engineering to enhance its stability. Analysis of the normal modes in internal coordinates
by iMODS was employed to investigate the collective motion of vaccine molecules (LopezBlanco et al., 2014). Negligible chance of deformability at molecular level was analyzed for the
putative vaccine construct V3, thereby strengthening our prediction. Moreover, molecular
docking was investigated to analyze the molecular affinity of the vaccine with different HLA
molecules i.e. DRB1*0101, DRB5*0101, DRB3*0202, DRB1*0401, DRB3*0101 and
DRB1*0301 (Table 5). It had been reported that a specific receptor-binding domain of CoV
spike protein usually recognizes its host receptor ACE2 (angiotensin-converting enzyme 2) (Li.
et al., 2003; Li, 2015). Previous studies also identified dipeptidyl peptidase 4 (DPP4) as a
functional receptor for human coronavirus (Raj et al., 2013). Therefore, we performed another
docking study prioritizing these immune receptors to strengthen our prediction (Figure 11).
Results showed that the designed construct bound with the selected receptors with minimum
binding energy which was biologically significant. Finally, in-silico restriction cloning was
adopted to check the suitability of construct V3 for entry into pET28a (+) vector and expression
in E. coli strain K12 (Figure 12).

Traditional ways to vaccine development are time consuming and laborious. Moreover, the result
may not be always as expected or fruitful (Stratton et al., 2003; Hasan et al., 2019). In silico
prediction and prescreening methods, on the contrary, offer some advantages while saving time
and cost for production. Therefore, the present study may aid in the development of preventive
strategies and novel vaccines to combat infections caused by 2019-nCoV. However, further wet
lab trials involving model organism needs to be experimented for validating our findings.

on the top.
Figure 4: Phylogeny of envelope proteins of coronaviruses. The sub-genera under three different
genera have been shown on the left labels. The star signs represent the COVID-19 virus. 5
different pathogenic human corona viruses have been shown in bold form, including the MERS
virus (blue) and SARS-CoV-1 (yellow).
Figure 5: Phylogeny of membrane proteins of coronavirus. The sub-genera under three different
genera have been shown on the left labels. The blue and orange star represent the SARS-CoV1
and MERS virus, respectively.
Figure 6: Phylogeny of nucleocapsid proteins of coronavirus. The sub-genera under three
different genera have been shown on the left labels. The filled and unfilled circles show the
presence and absence of the domains labeled on the top. COVID-19, SARS-CoV1 and MERS
viruses are clades are labeled with blue, green and red colors, respectively.

Figure 10: Normal Mode Analysis (NMA) of vaccine protein V3. The directions of each
residues are given by arrows and the length of the line represented the degree of mobility in the
3D model (A and B). The main-chain deformability derived from high deformability regions
indicated by hinges in the chain which are negligible (C). The experimental B-factor was taken
from the corresponding PDB field and calculated from NMA (D). The eigenvalue represents the
motion stiffness and directly related to the energy required to deform the structure (E). The
variance associated to each normal mode is inversely related to the eigenvalue. Coloured bars
show the individual (red) and cummulative (green) variances (F). The covariance matrix
indicates coupling between pairs of residues, where they may be associated with correlated,
uncorrelated or anti-correlated motions, indicated by red, white and blue colours respectively
(G). The elastic network model identifies the pairs of atoms connected via springs. Each dot in
the diagram is coloured based on extent of stiffness between the corresponding pair of atoms.
The darker the greys, the stiffer the springs (H).
Figure 11: Docked complex of vaccine construct V3 with human ACE 2 (A), TLR- (B), DPP4
(C) and APN (D).
