Abstract

22

Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is caused by severe acute respiratory

23

syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). The spike (S) protein that mediates

24

SARS-CoV-2 entry into host cells is a major target for vaccines and therapeutics.

25

Thus, insights into its sequence variations are key to understanding the infection

26

and antigenicity of SARS-CoV-2. A dominant mutational variant at position 614 of

27

the S protein (aspartate to glycine, D614G mutation) was observed in the SARS-

28

CoV-2 genome sequence obtained from the Nextstrain database. Using a

29

pseudovirus-based assay, we identified that S-D614 and S-G614 protein

30

pseudotyped viruses share a common receptor, human angiotensin-converting

31

enzyme 2 (ACE2), which could be blocked by recombinant ACE2 with the fused Fc

32

region of human IgG1. However, S-D614 and S-G614 protein demonstrated

33

functional differences. First, S-G614 protein could be cleaved by serine protease

34

elastase-2 more efficiently. Second, S-G614 pseudovirus infected 293T-ACE2

35

cells significantly more efficiently than did the S-D614 pseudovirus, especially in

36

the presence of elastase-2. Third, an elastase inhibitor approved for clinical use

37

blocked elastase-enhanced S-G614 pseudovirus infection. Moreover, 93% (65/70)

38

convalescent sera from patients with COVID-19 could neutralize both S-D614 and

39

S-G614 pseudoviruses with comparable efficiencies, but about 7% (5/70)

40

convalescent sera showed reduced neutralizing activity against the S-G614

41

pseudovirus. These findings have important implications for SARS-CoV-2

42

transmission and immune interventions.

Introduction

47

Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is a novel

48

coronavirus reported in 2019 that caused the recent outbreak of coronavirus

49

disease 2019 (COVID-19)1. By July 4, 2020, the World Health Organization (WHO)

50

reported that 10.92 million people worldwide had been infected with SARS-CoV-2,

51

and that 523 000 individuals had died of COVID-19. This pandemic has had a

52

significant adverse impact on international, social, and economic activities.

53

Coronaviruses are enveloped, positive-stranded RNA viruses that contain the

54

largest known RNA genomes to date. The RNA genome of SARS-CoV-2 has been

55

rapidly sequenced to facilitate diagnostic testing, molecular epidemiologic source

56

tracking, and development of vaccines and therapeutic strategies2. The mutation

57

rate for RNA viruses is extremely high, which may contribute to their transmission

58

and virulence. The only significant variation in the SARS-CoV-2 spike (S) protein is

59

a non-synonymous D614G (aspartate (D) to glycine (G)) mutation3. Primary data

60

showed that S-G614 is a more pathogenic strain of SARS-CoV-2 with high

61

transmission efficiency3. However, whether the D614G mutation in the S protein

62

affects viral entry and infectivity in a cellular model is still unclear.

63
64

The S protein of coronavirus, the major determinant of host and tissue tropism, is a

65

major target for vaccines, neutralizing antibodies, and viral entry inhibitors4,5.

66

Similar to SARS-CoV, the cellular receptor of SARS-CoV-2 is angiotensin-

67

converting enzyme 2 (ACE2); however, the SARS-CoV-2 S protein has a 10- to

68

20-fold higher affinity for ACE2 than the corresponding S protein of SARS-CoV6,7.

69

Coronaviruses use two distinct pathways for cell entry: protease-mediated cell-

70

surface and endosomal pathways8. The S proteins of several coronaviruses are

71

cleaved by host proteases into S1 subunit for receptor binding and S2 subunit for

72

membrane fusion at the entry step of infection. Several cellular proteases including

73

furin, transmembrane protease serine 2 (TMPRSS2), and cathepsin (Cat) B/L are

74

critical for priming the SARS-CoV-2 S protein to enhance ACE2-mediated viral

75

entry4. Recently, Bhattacharyya et al. (2020) reported that a novel serine protease

76

(elastase-2) cleavage site was introduced into the S-G614 protein of SARS-CoV-

77

29. However, it is unknown whether the S-G614 protein can be processed and

78

activated by elastase-2 in a cellular model. The S protein plays a key role in the

79

evolution of coronaviruses to evade the host immune system. It is still uncertain

80

whether the D614G mutation affects the antigenic properties of the S protein.

81

Meanwhile, whether elastase-2 inhibitors and convalescent serum samples of

82

COVID-19 can block the infection of the D614G variant of SARS-CoV-2 remains

83

unknown.

84
85

In this study, we analyzed the S gene sequences of SARS-CoV-2 submitted to the

86

Global Initiative on Sharing All Influenza Data (GISAID) database. We examined

the expression and cleavage of S-D614 and S-G614 protein in cell lines. Using a

88

luciferase (Luc)-expressing lentiviral pseudotype system, we established a

89

quantitative pseudovirus-based assay for the evaluation of SARS-CoV-2 cell entry

90

mediated by the viral S protein variants. We also compared the neutralizing

91

sensitivity of the S-D614 and S-G614 protein pseudoviruses to convalescent sera

92

from patients with COVID-19. Our study provides further insights into the

93

transmission and immune interventions of this newly emerged virus.

Results

96

D614G mutation of SARS-CoV-2 S protein was globally distributed

97

The S protein of SARS-CoV-2, which contains 1,273 amino acids, forms a trimeric

98

spike on the virion surface and plays an essential role in viral entry. We analyzed

99

the SARS-CoV-2 S protein amino acid sequence from viral genomic sequences in

100

the GISAID database. In line with prior reports, we found a globally distributed S

101

protein mutation, D614 to G614, which represented 64.6% of all the analyzed

102

sequences (Fig. 1 and Table 1). Among the top 10 most abundant non-

103

synonymous mutations observed in the S protein, the relative abundance of the

104

D614G mutant (the clade G) was the highest around the world, indicating that

105

G614 strain may be selectively advantageous. Since the S protein is critical to

106

coronavirus infection, we sought to explore the potential impact of the most

107

prevalent D614G mutation on the S protein structure, expression, and function.

Using the cryo-electron microscopy structure of S protein (PBD ID: 6ZGE)

109

determined by Wrobel et al.10, we analyzed the potential effects of the D614G

110

mutation. As shown in Fig. 1b, residue D614 is located at the C-terminal region of

111

the S1 domain, which directly associates with S2. On the one hand, residue D614

112

forms a hydrogen bond with backbone of G593 and a salt bridge with K854, and

113

then is capped by the folded 833-855 motif of chain B (Fig. 1c). D614G mutation

114

would abolish these interactions. This change may destabilize the locked

115

conformation to promote receptor binding domain (RBD) opening and potentially

116

increase virus-receptor binding and membrane fusion activities. On the other hand,

117

we observed that D614 is remarkably close to the N-linked glycosylation site N616

118

(Fig 1c). Thus, the D614G mutation may enhance the fitness of SARS-CoV-2 by

119

increasing S protein stability and participating in glycosylation. Further studies are

120

required to determine the structure of S-G614 protein.

121
122

D614G mutation enhanced the cleavage of S protein variant by proteases

123

As the D614G mutation is proximal to the S1 cleavage domain, we predicted

124

potential cleavage sites of proteases in S protein variants using PROSPER11, and

125

identified a novel serine protease (elastase-2) cleavage site at residues 615-616

126

on the S1-S2 junction of the S-G614 protein (Fig. 2a, Supplementary information,

127

Table S2). To evaluate the expression and cleavage of SARS-CoV-2 S protein in a

128

human cell line, the codon-optimized S protein-expressing plasmids (pS-D614 and

129

pS-G614) were transfected into HEK 293T cells. The immunoblot analysis of

130

whole cell lysates revealed that both S-D614 and S-G614 proteins showed two

131

major protein bands (unprocessed S and cleaved S1 subunit), when allowed to

132

react with the monoclonal antibody targeting the RBD on the SARS-CoV-2 S

133

protein (Fig. 2b). However, the pS-G614-transfected cells showed a stronger S1

134

signal than pS-D614-transfected cells, indicating that the D614G mutation altered

135

the cleavability of the S protein by cellular proteases. Moreover, the elastase

136

inhibitor sivelestat sodium significantly decreased the S1 signal of S-D614 protein

137

(Fig. 2b). These data indicate that the D614G mutation of SARS-CoV-2 S

138

facilitates its cleavage by host serine protease elastase-2. The coronavirus S

139

protein must be cleaved by host proteases to enable membrane fusion, which is

140

critical for viral entry. Next, we sought to explore the impact of D614G mutation on

141

viral entry.

145

Lentiviral vectors can be pseudotyped with various heterologous viral

146

glycoproteins that modulate cellular tropism and entry properties12. Due to the

147

highly pathogenic nature of SARS-CoV-2, infectious SARS-CoV-2 must be

148

handled in a biosafety level 3 (BSL-3) facility. We generated pseudotyped SARS-

149

CoV-2 based on the viral S protein using a lentiviral system, which introduced a

150

Luc (luciferase) reporter gene for quantification of SARS-CoV-2 S-mediated entry.

cells.

154

The titers of S-D614 and S-G614 protein pseudotyped viruses were determined by

155

reverse transcriptase quantitative polymerase chain reaction (RT-qPCR)

156

expressed as the number of viral RNA genomes per mL, and then adjusted to the

157

same concentration (3.8 × 104 copies in 50 μL) for the following experiments. The

158

virus infectivity was determined by a Luc assay expressed as relative

159

luminescence units (RLU). HEK 293T cells expressing human ACE2 (293T-ACE2)

160

were used to test the correlation between ACE2 expression and pseudoviral

161

susceptibility. The vesicular stomatitis virus G (VSV-G) pseudovirus was used as

162

control. As shown in Fig. 3a, both HEK 293T and 293T-ACE2 cells could be

163

effectively transduced by VSV-G pseudovirus. However, the entry of S-D614 and

164

S-G614 pseudoviruses is highly dependent on its cellular receptor ACE2

165

expression. The 293T-ACE2 cells showed an approximately 250-fold and 530-fold

166

increase in Luc activity when transduced by S-D614 and S-G614 pseudoviruses

167

compared to HEK 293T cells, respectively (Fig. 3a). We then detected the

168

inhibitory ability of ACE2-Ig, a fusion protein consisting of the extracellular domain

169

(Met 1-Ser 740) of human ACE2 linked to the Fc region of human IgG1 at the C-

170

terminus13. Both S-D614 and S-G614 pseudoviruses were potently inhibited by

171

ACE2-Ig, and the IC 50 (the concentration causing 50% inhibition of pseudoviral

172

infection) values were 0.13 and 0.15 μg/mL, respectively (Fig. 3b). To further

173

compare the viral entry efficiency meditated by S variants, we detected the Luc

174

activity at different time points post-infection. With the G614 S variant, the increase

175

in viral transduction over the D614 variant was 2.2-fold at 48 h post-infection. The

176

highest transduction efficiency (approximately 2.5 × 104 RLU) was observed 72 h

177

post-infection with the S-G614 pseudovirus, which was approximately 2.4-fold

178

higher than that of the S-D614 pseudovirus (Fig. 3c). These data suggest that the

179

D614G mutation in S protein significantly promotes viral entry into ACE2-

180

expressing cells, and ACE2-Ig efficiently blocks both wild-type and mutant S

181

pseudotype virus infection.

182

We next explored the mechanism by which S-G614 increased pseudoviral

183

infectivity. The proteolytic activation of S protein is required for coronavirus

184

infectivity, and the protease-mediated cell-surface pathway is critical for SARS-

185

CoV-2 entry4. Since we observed S-G614 could be more efficiently cleaved by the

186

host protease when exogenously expressed in 293T cells, we assumed that host

187

proteases may be involved in the enhancement of S-G614 viral entry. As shown in

188

Fig. 3d, when 293T-ACE2 cells were treated with 100 μg/mL elastase before virus

189

infection, the RLU value in S-G614 pseudovirus-infected cells (6.9 × 104) was

190

about 3.1 fold higher than that of the S-D614 (2.2 × 104), indicating that residue

191

G614 facilitates elastase-induced viral entry. In addition, the clinically proven

192

serine protease inhibitor sivelestat sodium, which is active against elastase, dose-

193

dependently blocked S-G614-driven entry into 293T-ACE2 in the presence of 100

194

μg/mL elastase (Fig. 3e). These data indicated that the infectivity of S-G614

195

pseudovirus containing an additional elastase-2 cleavage site is enhanced by

196

exogenous elastase; therefore, S-G614 pseudovirus is more sensitive to sivelestat

197

sodium than the S-D614 pseudovirus.

198

We also tested two other protease inhibitors, camostat mesylate and E-64d, which

199

block host TMPRSS2 and CatB/L, respectively. In 293T-ACE2 cells lacking

200

TMPRSS2, the serine protease inhibitor camostat mesylate did not inhibit S-D614

201

or S-G614 pseudoviral infection (Fig. S1a), while the cysteine protease inhibitor E-

202

64d significantly blocked the entry of these two pseudoviruses, with IC 50 values of

203

0.37 μM and 0.24 μM for S-D614 and S-G614 pseudoviruses, respectively (Fig.

204

S1b). As expected, these protease inhibitors had no impact on VSV-G pseudovirus

205

infection. Together, these results suggest that S-meditated viral entry into 293T-

206

ACE2 cells deficient in TMPRSS2 is endosomal cysteine protease CatB/L-

207

dependent; therefore, S-D614 and S-G614 pseudoviruses showed similar

208

sensitivity to the CatB/L inhibitor E-64d in 293T-ACE2 cells.

209
210

Neutralization effect of convalescent sera from patients with COVID-19

211

against S-D614 and S-G614 pseudoviruses

212

Neutralizing antibodies are important for prevention of and possible recovery from

213

viral infections. However, as viruses mutate during replication and spread, host

214

neutralizing antibodies generated in the earlier phase of the infection may not be

215

as effective later on14,15. To test whether D614G mutations could affect the

216

neutralization sensitivity of the virus, the neutralization activity of serum samples

217

from convalescent patients with COVID-19 against SARS-CoV-2 S-D614 and S-

218

G614 pseudoviruses were evaluated. To perform the neutralization assay, 50 μL

219

pseudovirus (3.8 × 104 copies) was incubated with serially diluted sera. As shown

220

in Fig. 4a, the inhibition rate of sera from convalescent COVID-19 patients was

221

analyzed at a single dilution of 1:1000, among the 70 tested sera, 65 of them

222

showed neutralizing activities against both S-D614 and S-G614 pseudoviruses

223

with comparable efficiencies. However, five sera samples (patients 1#, 7#, 40#,

224

42# and 52#) showed decreased inhibition rate against the S-G614 pseudovirus.

225

The serum from patient 1# failed to neutralize the S-G614 pseudovirus, even

226

though it neutralized about 30% of the S-D614 pseudovirus at a 1:1000 dilution.

227

Then, the inhibition curves and half-maximal inhibitory dose (ID 50 ) of sera samples

228

from five convalescent patients and one healthy donor were analyzed. Sera from

229

patients 17# and 39#, which were able to neutralize both pseudoviruses to similar

230

degrees, showed similar ID 50 values (Fig. 4b). However, sera from patients 1#, 7#,

231

40#, 42# and 52# showed relative high neutralizing activity against the S-D614

232

pseudovirus with an ID 50 ranging from 729 to 1524, but showed decreased

233

neutralizing activity against the S-G614 pseudovirus with an ID 50 ranging from 216

234

to 367, indicating a 2.5- to 5.9-fold reduction in neutralizing titers (Fig. 4b). These

235

data indicate that most antisera (93%) from patients, likely infected with earlier

236

SARS-CoV-2 variant, can cross neutralize S-G614 variant, although D614G

237

mutation decreases the neutralization sensitivity to 7% convalescent sera.

241

receptor recognition, viral inhibitors, and evaluation of neutralizing antibodies

242

without the requirement of BSL-3 laboratories. We constructed pseudotyped

243

SARS-CoV-2 based on the viral S protein using a lentiviral system, which

244

incorporated a Luc reporter gene for easy quantification of coronavirus S protein-

245

mediated entry. We investigated the major mutation in the S protein at position 614

246

and found that serine protease elastase-2 participates in the proteolytic activation

247

of the S-G614 protein, thereby enhancing viral entry into 293T-ACE2 cells (Fig. 5).

248

We demonstrated the potential role of the elastase-2 inhibitor sivelestat in blocking

249

S-G614 pseudovirus infection in the presence of elastase. Although S-D614 and

250

S-G614 variants could be similarly neutralized by most antisera, we found that the

251

S-G614 pseudovirus was more resistant to some neutralizing antisera than S-

252

D614 pseudovirus.

253
254

Several findings stand out in our study: First, we found that the entry efficiency of

255

S-G614 pseudotyped virus was about 2.4 times higher than that of the S-D614

256

pseudovirus when viral input doses were normalized, suggesting that D614G

257

mutation promotes the infectivity of SARS-CoV-2 and enhances viral

258

transmissibility. Since the pseudoviruses were employed in a single round of

259

infection assay, this seemingly small increase in entry activity could cause a large

260

difference in viral infectivity in vivo. Yao et al. (2020) reported that a patient-

261

derived viral isolate ZJU-1, which harbors the D614G mutation, has a viral load 19

infected16. However, the ZJU-1 isolate contained two other non-synonymous

264

mutations in open reading frame 1a (ORF1a) and envelope (E) gene. Our results

265

also elucidated the cause of increased entry efficiency due to the D614G mutation

266

in the S protein of SARS-CoV-2. The S-G614 protein contains a novel serine

267

protease cleavage site, so it could be cleaved by host elastase-2 more efficiently.

268

Previously studies on SARS-CoV demonstrated that the protease-mediated cell

269

surface entry facilitated a 100- to 1,000-fold increase in efficient infection

270

compared to the endosomal pathway in the absence of proteases17.

271
272

Second, we found that elastase-enhanced S-G614 pseudoviral infection could be

273

partially blocked by sivelestat sodium. Elastase-2, also known as neutrophil

274

elastase, plays an important role in degenerative and inflammatory diseases.

275

Sivelestat, a drug approved to treat acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) in

276

Japan and South Korea, has a beneficial effect on the pulmonary function of

277

patients with ARDS and systemic inflammatory response syndrome18. About 10–

278

15% of patients with COVID-19 progress to ARDS19. Since sivelestat may not only

279

mitigate the damage of neutrophil elastase on lung connective tissue, but also limit

280

virus spread by inhibiting S protein processing, Mohamed et al. (2020) advocated

281

the use of sivelestat to alleviate neutrophil-induced damage in critically ill patients

282

with COVID-1920. Our in vitro results also indicate that sivelestat sodium or similar

283

neutrophil elastase inhibitors might be an effective option for treatment of COVID-

284

19 caused by SARS-CoV-2 harboring the D614G mutation.

285
286

Third, we observed that the S-G614 pesudovirus was more resistant to

287

neutralization by convalescent sera from patients, likely infected in mid- to late-

288

January when wild-type (D614) virus was mainly circulating in China. Koyama et

289

al. (2020) reported that D614G is located in one of the predicted B-cell epitopes of

290

SARS-CoV-2 S protein, and this is a highly immunodominant region and may

291

affect the effectiveness of vaccine with wild-type S protein14. D614 is conserved in

292

the S protein of SARS-CoV in 2003. Previous studies of SARS-CoV suggested

293

that the peptide S 597–625 is a major immunodominant peptide in humans and elicits

294

a long-term B-cell memory response after natural infection with SARS-CoV21.

295

Regions between amino acids 614 and 621 of SARS-CoV-2 S protein were also

296

identified as a B-cell epitope by different methods, and the change in D614G may

297

affect the antigenicity of this region22. In our study, we observed that 7% (5/70)

298

convalescent sera showed markedly different neutralization activities between S-

299

G614 and S-G61 protein pseudotyped viruses, indicating that the D614G mutation

300

reduces the sensitivity to neutralizing antibodies from some patients infected with

301

earlier SARS-CoV-2 variant. Whether these patients were at high risk of reinfection

302

with the S-G614 variant should be explored in further studies. It will also be

303

important to determine the breadth of the neutralizing capacity of vaccine-induced

304

neutralizing antibodies.

305
306

Recently, several groups also reported that S-G614 enhances viral infectivity

307

based on pseudovirus assays23–26, but due to the small sample size, they found no

308

effect on the neutralization sensitivity of the virus23,24,26. Given the evolving nature

309

of the SARS-CoV-2 RNA genome, antibody treatment and vaccine design require

310

further considerations to accommodate D614G and other mutations that may

311

affect the immunogenicity of the virus.

312
313

Our study had some limitations. First, 19 amino acids of S protein on the C-

314

terminal were not included in order to improve the packaging efficiency of the

315

SARS-CoV-2 S protein pseudotyped virus, and this pseudovirus only recapitulates

316

viral entry events. Therefore, additional assays with authentic SARS-CoV-2

317

viruses are required. Second, we only tested neutralizing antibodies against the S

318

protein. Previous studies on SARS-CoV indicated that only a small fraction of

319

memory B cells specific for SARS-CoV antigens are directed against neutralizing

320

epitopes present on the S protein27. Third, in addition to D614G, further studies on

321

other mutations in the S protein are needed to evaluate their impact on SARS-

322

CoV-2 infectivity, pathogenicity, and immunogenicity. Further studies are needed

323

to determine the impact of these mutations on the severity of COVID-19.

324
325

In summary, we established a SARS-CoV-2 S protein-mediated pseudoviral entry

326

assay and explored the cellular entry of S-D614 and S-G614 pseudotyped viruses.

327

Our study provided evidence that the D614G mutation introduces an additional

328

elastase-2 cut site in the S protein, thereby promoting its cleavage and viral cell

329

entry, resulting in SARS-CoV-2 becoming more infectious. Importantly, the D614G

330

mutation reduced the sensitivity of the virus to serum neutralizing antibodies in 7%

331

convalescent patients with COVID-19. Our study will be helpful for understanding

332

SARS-CoV-2 transmission and for the design of vaccines and therapeutic

333

interventions against COVID-19.

SARS-CoV-2 genome analysis

375

The online Nextstrain analysis tool (https://nextstrain.org/ncov) was used to track

376

the D614G mutation in SARS-CoV-2 genomes. All the 2,834 genomes sampled

377

between Dec 20, 2019 and Jun 12, 2020 were visualized using the ‘rectangular’

378

layout. The mutations were labeled on branches.

379

All complete SARS-CoV-2 S gene sequences were downloaded from The National

380

Center for Biotechnology Information (NCBI) website

381

(https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/sars-cov-2/) on Jun 1, 2020. We obtained 4,701 S

382

coding sequences from NCBI, and after excluding partial and frameshift

383

sequences, 4,649 completed S sequences were used for further analysis. All S

384

nucleotide sequences were translated to amino acid sequences. The nucleotide

385

and amino acid sequences of S were aligned with multiple sequence alignment

386

software MUltiple Sequence Comparison by Log-Expectation (MUSCLE)

amounts of protein samples were electrophoretically separated by 10% sodium

396

dodecyl sulfate polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, and then transferred to

397

polyvinylidene difluoride membrane (Millipore, Billerica, MA, USA). The

Production and titration of SARS-CoV-2 S pseudoviruses. SARS-CoV-2

404

pseudotyped viruses were produced as previously described with some

405

modifications30. Briefly, 5 × 106 HEK 293T cells were co-transfected with 6 μg each

406

of pNL4-3.Luc.R-E- and recombinant SARS-CoV-2 S plasmids (pS-D614 or pS-

407

G614) using Lipofectamine 3000 Transfection Reagent (Invitrogen) according to

408

the manufacturer’s instructions. The S-D614 and S-G614 protein pseudotyped

409

viruses in supernatants were harvested 48 h after transfection, centrifuged, filtered

410

through a 0.45 μm filter, and stored at −80°C. The pMD2.G was co-transfected

411

with the pNL4-3.Luc.R-E- plasmid to package the VSV-G pseudovirus.

412

The titers of the pseudoviruses were calculated by determining the number of viral

413

RNA genomes per mL of viral stock solution using RT-qPCR with primers and a

414

probe that target LTR31. Sense primer: 5′-TGTGTGCCCGTCTGTTGTGT-3′, anti-

419

was amplified using the TaqMan One-Step RT-PCR Master Mix Reagents (Applied

420

viral entry, 293T-ACE2 cells (2 × 104) grown on 96-well plates were infected with

426

the same amount of S-D614 or S-G614 pseudovirus (3.8 × 104 copies in 50 μL).

427

The cells were transferred to fresh DMEM medium 8 h post-infection, and RLU

equivalent to 3.8 × 104 vector genomes, were incubated with serial dilutions of

434

sera samples from patients and normal human serum as a negative control for 1 h

435

at 37 °C, then added to the 293T-ACE2 cells (with three replicates for each
