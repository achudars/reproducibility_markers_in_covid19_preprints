Abstract

26

The current pandemic severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) pose a

27

critical public health threat worldwide. Coronaviruses (subfamily Orthocoronavirinae, family

28

Coronaviridae, order Nidovirales) are a group of enveloped positive-sense single-stranded RNA

29

viruses. Six pathogenic human coronaviruses, likely zoonotic viruses, cause the common cold in

30

humans. A new emerging coronavirus, SARS-CoV-2, become a crucial etiology for the

31

Coronavirus-induced disease 19 (COVID-19). However, effective therapeutics and vaccines

32

against multiple coronaviruses remain unavailable. This study aimed to investigate an antiviral

33

molecule, single chain variable fragment (scFv), against SARS-CoV-2 and other coronaviruses.

34

3D8, a recombinant scFv, exhibits broad-spectrum antiviral activity against DNA and RNA viruses

35

owing to its nucleic acid-hydrolyzing property. Here, we report that 3D8 scFv inhibited the

36

replication of SARS-CoV-2, human coronavirus OC43 (HCoV-OC43), and porcine epidemic

37

diarrhea virus (PEDV). Our results revealed the prophylactic and therapeutic effects of 3D8 scFv

38

against SARS-CoV-2 in Vero E6 cells. Immunoblot and plaque assays showed the absence of

39

coronavirus nucleoproteins and infectious particles in 3D8 scFv-treated cells, respectively. In

40

addition, we observed the antiviral effects of 3D8 against HCoV-OC43 and PEDV. In conclusion,

41

this study provides insights into the broad-spectrum antiviral agent of 3D8 scFv; thus, it could be

42

considered a potential antiviral countermeasure against SARS-CoV-2 and zoonotic coronaviruses.

Introduction

52

Coronaviruses (subfamily Orthocoronavirinae in the family Coronaviridae of the order

53

Nidovirales) belong a group of enveloped viruses containing a single-stranded positive-sense RNA

54

genome (1, 2). Divergent coronaviruses constitute four genetic lineage groups, including

55

alphacoronaviruses, betacoronaviruses, gammacoronaviruses, and deltacoronaviruses. These

56

viruses infect a broad range of natural reservoir hosts, including humans, bats, rodents, pigs, and

57

camels (3). Currently, six coronavirus species cause infectious diseases in humans. Four

58

coronaviruses, human coronavirus OC43 (HCoV-OC43), 229E, NL63, and HKU1, induce flu-like

59

common cold symptoms in immunocompromised individuals (4, 5). Two highly transmissible and

60

pathogenic viruses, severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 1 (SARS-CoV-1) and Middle

61

East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV), are associated with fatal illness involving

62

pneumonia and respiratory disorders (6). In late December 2019, the city of Wuhan, in the Hubei

63

province of China, reported a few cases of patients with severe pneumonia of an unknown

64

etiological agent (7), which was identified as the novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19) caused

65

by SARS-CoV-2 (8). SARS-CoV-2 has several similarities to SARS-CoV and binds to the

66

common host cell receptor, angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE-2), and Transmembrane

67

Serine Protease 2 (TMPRSS2) (9, 10); however, the novel strain is genetically distinct from SARS-

68

CoV-1 (11). The novel coronavirus SARS-CoV-2 is transmitted through species barriers from bats

69

to humans (12). COVID-19 is characterized by influenza-like symptoms ranging from mild to

severe lung injury as well as multi-organ failure, leading to death in patients with comorbidities

71

(13). This novel virus has led to a global pandemic, which resulted in unparalleled public health

72

emergencies (14). As of November 24, 2020, it has rapidly spread to 220 countries and territories,

73

infecting over 58.7 million people including more than 1.38 million deaths (15)

74

[https://covid19.who.int].

75

The rapid and widespread emergence of SARS-CoV-2 presents the urgent need for antiviral

76

countermeasures (4). Currently, there are no available therapeutics against human coronaviruses.

77

A variety of antivirals are repositioning on clinical trials Nucleoside analogues (remdesivir,

78

favipiravir and ribavirin), protease inhibitors (disulfiram, lopinavir and ritonavir), antiparasitic

79

drugs (chloroquine and hydrochloroquine), pegylated interferons, monoclonal antibodies,

80

oligonucleotide-based therapies, peptides and small-molecule drugs are contemplated for possible

81

therapeutic agents against SARS-CoV-2 (16, 17). In particular, remdesivir, which inhibits viral

82

RNA polymerases, is proposed as a potent antiviral against SARS-CoV-2 and clinical

83

improvement has been observed in patients under compassionate use (18, 19)

84

3D8, a 27-kDa recombinant antibody fragment, is a single chain variable fragment (scFv) that

85

comprises a variable region of a heavy chain covalently linked to the corresponding variable region

86

of a light chain. It was originally found in autoimmune-prone Murphy Roths Large (MRL) mice

87

(20). The 3D8 scFv possessing the nucleic acid hydrolyzing activity degrades viral DNA and/or

88

mRNA in the infected cells (21, 22). This protein has the broad-spectrum antiviral effects against

89

herpes simplex virus (HSV), influenza virus, and pseudorabies (PRV) virus in vitro. 3D8 exhibited

90

in vivo antiviral therapeutic effects against PRV in C57BL/6 mice. The transmission of avian

91

influenza and bronchitis viruses was suppressed in transgenic chickens expressing the 3D8 scFv

92

(23-26). However, the antiviral activity of the 3D8 scFv against SARS-CoV-2 and other

93

coronaviruses remains unknown.

94

Here, this study aimed to investigate the antiviral activity of 3D8 scFv against emerging

95

coronaviruses in vitro. These data provide insight into a broad-spectrum antiviral agent of scFv

96

against SARS-CoV-2 and multiplex coronaviruses.

Results

3D8 inhibits SARS-CoV-2 in a dose-dependent manner

100

To determine the antiviral activity of the 3D8 scFv against SARS-CoV-2, different concentrations

101

of the scFv were applied to Vero E6 cells after virus challenge. SARS-CoV-2 replication in cultures

102

treated with various doses of 3D8 was quantified using RT-qPCR (Fig 1A). The replication of

103

SARS-CoV-2 significantly decreased in a 3D8 dose-dependent manner. The 10 µM and 5 µM

104

concentrations of 3D8 effectively inhibited viral replication by up to approximately 90% and 75%,

105

respectively, compared to the non-treatment group. The production of infectious virus particles was

106

quantified by performing the plaque assay (Fig 1B). The viral titer of SARS-CoV-2 was reduced in

107

a 3D8 dose-dependent manner. In particular, when treated with 10 µM of 3D8, the titer of the virus

108

was reduced by 10 times compared to the non-treatment group. Continual treatment with 3D8

109

showed antiviral activity against SARS-CoV-2 at an effective concentration (EC50) of 4.25 µM

110

(Fig 1C). Moreover, this scFv did not show cytotoxicity in Vero E6 cells treated with the 3D8 scFv

111

at concentrations ranging from 1 µM to 10 µM (Fig 1D). However, cytotoxicity was noted at a dose

112

of 40 µM.

3D8 effectively inhibits SARS-CoV-2 in pretreated cells (prophylactic effect)

115

We determined the prophylactic antiviral activity of the 3D8 scFv against SARS-CoV-2 in

116

pretreated cell cultures. A significant reduction in the SARS-CoV-2 N gene copies was observed

117

upon treatment with 10 µM 3D8 scFv (Fig 2A). The gene copy number of the SARS-CoV-2 E gene

118

and RdRp gene was reduced by 99.6% and 99.4%, respectively (data not shown). The N protein of

119

SARS-CoV-2 was not observed after treatment with the 3D8 scFv (Fig 2B). Furthermore, we

120

determined the inhibitory effect of 3D8 on the production of infectious particles of SARS-CoV-2.

121

The production of infectious virus particles was more than 10 times lower in the scFv-treated group

122

than in the control group (Fig 2C). Collectively, these data demonstrated that 3D8 has a

123

prophylactic effect on SARS-CoV-2 infection.

124
125

3D8 effectively inhibits SARS-CoV-2 in post-treated cells (therapeutic effect)

126

To determine the therapeutic effect of 3D8 at 2 h post-infection (p.i.), we assessed the inhibitory

127

activity of SARS-CoV-2 based on the reduction of the relative gene copy number (Fig 2D). 3D8

128

treatment resulted in a decrease in the gene copy number of the N gene by 63.4%. Western blot

129

analysis revealed the absence of N protein expression in the 3D8-treated samples (Fig 2E). The

130

production of infectious particles of SARS-CoV-2 in the 3D8-treated group was 10 times lower

131

than that in the control group (Fig 2F). The reduced viral gene copy number, lack of infectious

132

virus particles, and absence of N protein expression indicated the therapeutic effect of 3D8 upon

133

SARS-CoV-2 infection.

134
135

3D8 possesses broad-spectrum antiviral activity against multiple coronaviruses

136

To determine the antiviral activity of 3D8 against other coronaviruses, viral gene copies and

137

infectious particles were examined after HCoV-OC43 and PEDV infections. The 3D8-treated group

138

revealed effective inhibition of viral replication upon HCoV-OC43 infection. The load of HCoV-

139

OC43 RNA was significantly reduced in a 3D8 dose-dependent manner (Fig 3A). The expression

140

of viral proteins was inhibited upon treatment with 3D8 (Fig 3B). 3D8 effectively inhibited the

141

replication of HCoV-OC43 with the EC50 value of 1.40 µM (Fig 3C). Immunohistochemistry

142

analysis exhibited a reduction in HCoV-OC43 replication upon 3D8 treatment (Fig 3D).

143

Treatment with 3D8 resulted in the effective inhibition of viral replication upon PEDV infection.

144

The load of PEDV RNA was significantly suppressed in a 3D8 dose-dependent manner (Fig 4A).

145

The expression of viral proteins was reduced upon treatment with 3D8 (Fig 4B). The EC50 value of

146

3D8 against PEDV was 1.10 µM (Fig 4C). Immunohistochemistry analysis revealed a reduction in

147

PEDV replication upon 3D8 treatment (Fig 4D). These data demonstrated the broad-spectrum

148

activity of 3D8 against multiple zoonotic coronaviruses.

149
150

Discussion

151

Three novel human coronaviruses have emerged during the past two decades (3, 5). The outbreak

152

of COVID-19 occurred in late December in Wuhan (China) and rapidly became a global pandemic

153

(7). The public health emergency caused by the SARS-CoV-2 outbreak presents the demand for

154

countermeasures against emerging and re-emerging zoonotic coronaviruses. As the virus

155

disseminates, efforts are being made to mitigate transmission via public health interventions

156

including social distancing, quarantine, and contact tracing. However, therapeutics and vaccines

157

against SARS-CoV-2 are urgently needed for the effective control of outbreaks. In this study, we

158

demonstrated that 3D8, a nucleic acid-hydrolyzing scFv, inhibited the replication of SARS-CoV-2

159

and multiple coronaviruses in vitro.

161

The scFv is a molecule derived from an antibody composed of variable region of heavy and light

162

chains linked with peptides(20). scFv has applied for basic researches, biotechnological and

163

medicinal applications such as cancer therapy and potential alternatives to conventional diagnostic

164

approaches(25, 26). scFv has various advantages over traditional monoclonal antibodies such as

165

ease of genetic manipulation, rapid molecular design and characterization, greatly reduced size,

166

production of antibodies against viral proteins, and various expression systems. Neutralizing scFv

167

against N protein protects piglets from PEDV infection (27). The orally administered piglets had

168

no or mild clinical symptoms, intestinal lesions and significantly increased survival rates. 3D8 is a

169

unique scFv that possesses a broad-spectrum nuclease activity and confers antiviral protection from

170

a variety of viruses including DNA and RNA viruses (Figure 5) (28, 29). 3D8 scFv previously

171

showed the antiviral effect against infectious Bronchitis virus, a member of gammacoronaviruses

172

in transgenic chickens expressing 3D8 scFv (24). The antiviral activity of 3D8 scFv against SARS-

173

CoV-2 and other coronaviruses remained to be examined.

174

Our study demonstrated that 3D8 confers effective antiviral activity against SARS-CoV-2, HCoV-

175

OC43, and PEDV in vitro. The function of 3D8 inhibited the replication of multiple coronaviruses

176

in a dose-dependent manner. The reduction of infectious virus particles accounted for the nuclease

177

activity of 3D8, indicating the degradation of viral nucleic acids prohibited the production of viral

178

genomes and proteins. Upon infection with HCoV-OC43 and PEDV, the therapeutic treatment of

179

3D8 scFv showed the inhibition of viral replication and protein expression, indicating the antiviral

180

activity of multiple coronaviruses. The previous studies demonstrated the biochemical

181

characteristics and robust antiviral activity of 3D8 scFv against classical swine fever virus and

182

herpes simplex virus in vitro (22, 28). The 3D8 expressing transgenic mice and chickens exhibited

183

the in vivo antiviral activity against influenza virus and PRV (23, 29). The cellular entry mechanism

184

of 3D8 revealed a caveolin-dependent manner without a carrier (30). The intranasal transfer of 3D8

185

scFv into a mouse described the presence of the protein in the epithelial barrier of lung tissues (31).

186

Taken together, the 3D8, a nucleic-acid hydrolyzing mini-antibody, may be a potential candidate

187

for antivirals due to the broad spectrum, the easy penetration to the cell, and the accessibility to the

188

lung in vivo.

189

Infection of coronaviruses have significantly impacted on humans and livestocks (32). However,

190

the effective antiviral countermeasures against the viruses are still unavailable. HCoV-OC43,

191

belongs to lineage betacoronaviruses, is associated with mild common cold in humans. HCoV-

192

OC43 infection occurs frequently in early childhood and causes acute respiratory tract illness,

193

pneumonia and croup (33). PEDV, a member of alphacoronaviruses, is a highly contagious

194

coronavirus that causes severe diarrhea and death in neonatal piglets (27). All of age groups are

195

highly susceptible to PEDV infection with neonatal piglets under 2 weeks of age, showing the

196

highest mortality rates. In this study, HCoV-OC43 and PEDV were effectively reduced for the

197

replication and protein synthesis. These results suggest 3D8 may be a potential antiviral agent

198

against viral threats for the public health and livestock industry.

199

In this study, there is the limitation. The absence of in vivo study is a major limitation in animal

200

models. To address this, future studies are needed to illustrate the in vivo inhibitory effect of 3D8

201

scFv using the animal models. Although the previous studies presented the nuclease activity of 3D8

202

scFv, the precise cellular mechanism and in vivo effects of the administration remain to be further

203

investigated.

204

In conclusion, 3D8 scFv confers effective antiviral activity against the SARS-CoV-2 and multiple

205

coronaviruses. This study provides insights into the broad-spectrum antiviral countermeasure of

206

scFv; thus, it can be a potential antiviral agent against the emerging virus outbreak.

Sigma-Aldrich, MFCD01322099 and Abcam, ab9485) overnight at 4 °C and then incubated with

276

an anti-rabbit IgG-HRP conjugate for 1 h at room temperature. The membrane reaction with ECL

277

solution (Bio-Rad, 170-5061) was observed and confirmed via the chemiluminescence mode using

278

Immunocytochemistry

281

Immunocytochemistry for identifying the antiviral effects of 3D8 against the coronaviruses was

282

conducted as described previously [36]. Vero E6 cells were seeded at 1.5 × 104 cells in an 8-well

283

chamber and incubated for 24 h. PEDV and hCoV-OC43 were infected at MOI = 0.002 and 0.02,

284

respectively, for 2 h. About 5 μM (185 μg/mL) of purified 3D8 and 1% P/S antibiotics

285

(Gibco,15140122) were added to DMEM media (Hyclone, SH30243.01) supplemented with 10%

286

FBS (Welgene gold serum, S-001-07), and the media was incubated at 37 °C with 5% CO2. The

287

cells were washed with PBS and fixed for 15 min in ice-cold methanol at room temperature. The

288

cells were then permeabilized with permeabilization buffer (Biolegend, #421002) for 10 min at

289

room temperature. After blocking with 1% BSA + 0.3 M glycine (22.52 mg/mL) + PBST buffer

290

for 1 h at room temperature, primary antibodies for detecting PEDV (mouse, anti-PEDV

291

monoclonal Ab, Mybio, #MBS313516), hCoV-OC43 (mouse, anti-OC43 monoclonal Ab, LSBio,

292

#LS-C79764), and 3D8 (polyclonal rabbit IgG Serum Ab) were incubated overnight at 4 °C.

293

Following this, PEDV and hCoV-OC43 were incubated with TRITC-conjugated anti-mouse Ab

294

(1:500) (Abcam, #ab6786), and 3D8 was incubated with Alexa 488-conjugated anti-rabbit Ab

295

(1:1000) (Abcam, #ab150077). The nuclei were stained with Hoechst (Thermo Fisher, #62249)

296

during the last 10 min of incubation at room temperature. Cells were mounted in mounting medium

297

(VECTASHIELD, #H-1200) and observed using a NIKON A1R (Eclipse A1Rsi and Eclipse Ti-E).

Fig 5. Suggested mode of action for 3D8

448

3D8, a single chain variable fragment (scFv), is internalized into the cell through caveolae-mediated

449

endocytosis. After release from the endosomal compartment, 3D8 localizes to the cytosol. In the

450

cytosol, it binds to the viral nucleic acid and degrades it to prevent its amplification, thus inhibiting

451

viral growth. 3D8 confers nuclease activity without sequence specificity and hydrolyzes viral RNA

452

genomes or transcripts.
