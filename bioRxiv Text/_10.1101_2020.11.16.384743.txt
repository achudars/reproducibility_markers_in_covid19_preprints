Abstract [234 words]
Severe acute respiratory coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), the agent of the ongoing COVID-19
pandemic, jumped into humans from an unknown animal reservoir in late 2019. In line with
other coronaviruses, SARS-CoV-2 has the potential to infect a broad range of hosts. SARSCoV-2 genomes have now been isolated from cats, dogs, lions, tigers and minks. SARS-CoV2 seems to transmit particularly well in mink farms with outbreaks reported in Spain, Sweden,
the Netherlands, Italy, the USA and Denmark. Genomic data from SARS-CoV-2 isolated from
infected minks provides a natural case study of a secondary host jump of the virus, in this case
from humans to animals, and occasionally back again. We screened published SARS-CoV-2
genomes isolated from minks for the presence of recurrent mutations common in mink but
infrequent in SARS-CoV-2 genomes isolated from human infections. We identify 23 recurrent
mutations including three nonsynonymous mutations in the Receptor Binding Domain of the
SARS-CoV-2 spike protein that independently emerged at least four times but are only rarely
observed in human lineages. The repeat emergence of mutations across phylogenetically
distinct lineages of the virus isolated from minks points to ongoing adaptation of SARS-CoV2 to a new host. The rapid acquisition and spread of SARS-CoV-2 mutations in minks suggests
that if a similar phenomenon of host adaptation had occurred upon its jump into humans, those
human-specific mutations would likely have reached fixation already before the first SARSCoV-2 genomes were generated.

Introduction
SARS-CoV-2, the agent of the COVID-19 pandemic, is part of the Coronaviridae family,
whose members are widespread among wild populations of birds and mammals and tend to
have fairly broad host ranges1. Seven coronavirus species are currently known to infect
humans; SARS-CoV-1, SARS-CoV-2, MERS-CoV, and four endemic ‘common cold’
coronaviruses (HCoV-HKU1, HCoV-OC413, HCoV-229E, HCoV-NL63), all of which are of
zoonotic origin. The original host of SARS-CoV-2 has not been identified to date, but bats are
considered to be a plausible source2,3. Bats are also believed to represent the original host
reservoir for NL63 and 229E4–6, SARS-CoV-17–10 and MERS-CoV11–14, whereas the zoonotic
source for HCoV-HKU1 and HCoV-OC43 may be rodents, or possibly ruminants for the
latter15–17.

Upon an initial successful host jump, the ability of a pathogen to spread within its novel host
population depends on its ability to transmit effectively between individuals. The four endemic
HCoVs transmit readily in humans and are highly contagious particularly in children 18,19.
SARS-CoV-1 was probably less transmissible than SARS-CoV-220, which likely contributed
to the 2003 SARS outbreak being comparably easy to control. MERS-CoV transmits poorly
between humans and the repeat outbreaks it causes are primarily due to spillovers into humans
from a reservoir it established in camelids in the Arabic Peninsula21,22. Finally, SARS-CoV-2
is highly transmissible in humans with an unusually high basic reproductive numbers (R0) for
a respiratory virus having been reported in several setting23.

Transmissibility of a pathogen is expected to vary in different hosts and may often be limited
in the early stages after the host jump. Such initial maladaptation may lead to a phase of intense
natural selection when a pathogen acquires key mutations that maximize its transmission ability
in the novel host. Efforts to identify mutations associated to SARS-CoV-2’s transmissibility
failed to identify obvious candidates for adaptation to its human host24,25. The only possible
exception is the spike D614G mutation, whose role as a driver of transmission, or a neutral
genetic marker of the otherwise successful SARS-CoV-2 B.1 lineage remains debated24,26–28.
One plausible reason for the lack of mutations unambiguously associated to transmission in
SARS-CoV-2 is that they may have emerged and spread before the virus was identified. Indeed,
if by the time the earliest genomes were being sequenced, all key mutations associated to
increased transmission in humans had already reached fixation, it would be impossible to
identify those solely by analyzing SARS-CoV-2 genomes in circulation in humans.

Beyond humans and non-human primates, carnivores are predicted to be particularly
susceptible to SARS-CoV-2 infection29–34. Genomic data is currently available for SARS-CoV2 isolated from dogs, domestic cats, tigers, lions and minks31,35–43. Transmissibility may vary
between susceptible carnivore hosts. For example domestic cats (Felis catus) are both more
susceptible to SARS-CoV-2 and more infectious than dogs (Canis lupus familiaris)41. SARSCoV-2 has also been shown to transmit well in experimental mustelid systems35,39,44,45 and, in
real-world settings, minks (Neovison vison and Mustela lutreola) are highly susceptible to
SARS-CoV-2 circulating in humans. Major mink farm outbreaks have been reported in
multiple countries since April 202037,38,43.

The generation and release of genomic data from SARS-CoV-2 outbreaks in farmed European
(Mustela lutreola) and American minks (Neovison vison) offer opportunities to identify
mutations emerging and spreading in mink farms following the host jump(s). The conditions
in intensive farming settings may provide highly suitable environments for small fitness
selective differentials between strains to overcome the effect of genetic drift, allowing for
natural selection to further increase transmissibility. Particularly promising candidates for host
adaptation are those mutations occurring recurrently in different mink SARS-CoV-2 lineages,
and that are uncommon in human viruses. The secondary host jump from humans into minks
offers a glimpse into the window of early viral host adaptation of SARS-CoV-2 to a new host
that has likely been missed at the start of the COVID-19 pandemic.

We screened publicly available SARS-CoV-2 genomes isolated from minks for the presence
of recurrent mutations. We identified seven nonsynonymous mutations independently arising
at least three times as plausible candidates for adaptation to transmission in minks. All seven
candidate mutations are at low frequency in large repositories of SARS-CoV-2 strains
circulating in humans. We note in particular three recurrent nonsynonymous mutations in the
receptor-binding domain of the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein (S-protein), the region essential for
binding to host Angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) receptors allowing cell entry46,47.
We computationally predict the role of candidates in this region on modulating the binding
stability of the human and mink spike protein ACE2 complex. Our results highlight the rapid
and repeat emergence of mutations in the spike protein, across phylogenetically distinct
lineages of the virus isolated from minks in Denmark and the Netherlands, and point to rapid
adaptation of SARS-CoV-2 to a new host.

Materials and Methods
Alignment of mink SARS-CoV-2
All publicly available genome assemblies of SARS-CoV-2 isolated from minks were
downloaded

from

both

GISAID48,49

(https://www.gisaid.org)

and

NCBI

(https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/labs/virus/vssi/#/ ) as of 14th October 2020, which included
published genomic data associated to two studies of SARS-CoV-2 in minks in the
Netherlands37,38. A full list of the 239 considered accessions is provided in Table S1 which
includes 227 genome assemblies sampled in the Netherlands and 12 genome assemblies
sampled in Denmark covering the period of the 24th of April 2020 to 16th of September 2020.
Some of the genomes were flagged as ‘low quality’ (commented in Table S1) but were
included in the initial analaysis. All genome assemblies were profile aligned to the SARSCoV-2 reference genome Wuhan-Hu-1 (NC_045512.2) using MAFFT v7.20550. SNPs flagged
as putative sequencing errors were masked (a full list of ‘masked’ sites is available at
https://github.com/W-L/ProblematicSites_SARSCoV2/blob/master/problematic_sites_sarsCov2.vcf, accessed 14/10/2020)51. Wuhan-Hu-1
was retained to root the tree. A maximum likelihood phylogenetic tree was built across the
alignment (Figure S1) using RaxML52 run via the Augur (https://github.com/nextstrain/augur)
tree implementation (Figure 1). We informally estimated the substitution rate over the mink
SARS-CoV-2 alignment by computing the root-to-tip temporal regression implemented in
BactDating v1.0.153 (Figure S2).

Global context of mink SARS-CoV-2 infections
To place SARS-CoV-2 genomes isolated from minks into a global context we downloaded
56,803 high quality assemblies (high coverage, >29,700bp and with a fraction of ‘N’
nucleotides <5%) from the worldwide diversity of human SARS-CoV-2 available on
GISAID48,49 on 25/08/2020. All animal strains were removed as well as samples flagged by
NextStrain as ‘exclude’ (https://github.com/nextstrain/ncov/blob/master/defaults/exclude.txt
as of 25/08/2020). Following alignment and masking as described above, this left 54,793
assemblies for downstream analysis to which we added the mink SARS-CoV-2 alignment. A
full metadata table, list of acknowledgements and exclusions is provided in Table S2. We
constructured a maximum likelihood phylogenetic tree over the 55,030 included genomes
using IQ-TREE v2.1.0 Covid release54 specifying the fast mode. Following construction of the
tree, 57 long branch phylogenetic outliers were detected by TreeShrink 55 and were
subsequently removed, together with two low-quality mink SARS-CoV-2 assemblies which

were also considered phylogenetic outliers (EPI_ISL_577816 and EPI_ISL_577819). Trees
were queried and plotted using the R packages Ape v5.456 and ggtree v1.16.657 (see Figure 1).

Mutation analysis
All variable positions in the coding regions of the genome were identified and annotated for
synonymous or nonsynonymous status (Figure S3-S4). This was done by retrieving the amino
acid changes corresponding to all SNPs at these positions using a custom Biopython (v1.76)
script
(https://github.com/cednotsed/mink_homoplasies/blob/main/dnds/snp_to_sav_parser.py) with
annotations reported in Table S3. The Orf coordinates used (including the Orf1ab ribosomal
frameshift site) were obtained from the associated metadata for Wuhan-Hu-1 (NC_045512.2).
Assemblies

were

also

uploaded

to

CoVSurver

(https://www.gisaid.org/epiflu-

applications/covsurver-mutations-app/) to report the prevalence of mutations and indels
relative to SARS-CoV-2 assemblies available on the GISAID database48,49.

The frequencies of each type of mutation in the human and mink SARS-CoV-2 alignments
were calculated using the base.freq function from the R package Ape v5.456 (Figure S5). We
tested whether the mutational frequencies in the human and mink genomes differed using a
Monte Carlo simulation of the χ2 statistic with fixed margins (2000 iterations) 58,59. This was
implemented using the chisq.test function in R with the simulate.p.value flag. CpG dinucleotide
frequencies for both SARS-CoV-2 alignments of genomes isolated from human and mink were
also

calculated

using

a

custom

R

script

(https://github.com/cednotsed/mink_homoplasies/blob/main/CpG/plot_CpG.R) (Figure S6).
A Wilcoxon rank sum test implemented using the wilcox.test function in R was used to test if
the distribution of CpG dinucleotide frequencies differed between the two datasets.

Identification of recurrent mutations
We screened for the presence of recurrent mutations in the mink SARS-CoV-2 masked
alignment using HomoplasyFinder v0.0.0.960, as described in our previous work61,62.
HomoplasyFinder employs the method first described by Fitch 63, providing, for each site, the
site specific consistency index and the minimum number of independent emergences in the
phylogenetic tree. All nucleotide positions with a consistency index <0.5 are considered
homoplasic (Figure 2, Figure S7, Table S4). Sites identified as homoplasic were screened
against the global dataset of 54,793 human SARS-CoV-2 (Figure S8). In addition amino acid

replacements were identified in human samples in the CoV-GLUE64 repository (accessed 16th
November 2020, last update from GISAID 9th November 2020), which provides frequently
updated screens against all assemblies shared to GISAID 48,49 (Figure 2, Table S4).

Structural data used for the analysis
The structure of the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein, reference strain, bound to human ACE2 has
been solved at 2.45Å resolution65 (PDB ID 6M0J). We visualised this structure using PyMOL
v2.4.166. We used this as the template to model the structures of the American mink (Neovision
vision) ACE2 bound to the SARS-CoV-2 reference (Wuhan-Hu-1) and the mink ACE2 protein
bound to versions of SARS-CoV-2 mutated for three candidate sites in the RBD. We also built
a model of the human ACE2 bound to the mutated SARS-CoV-2.

We generated query–template alignments using HH-suite67 and predicted 3D models using
MODELLER v.9.2468. We used the ‘very_slow’ schedule for model refinement to optimise the
geometry of the complex and interface. We generated 10 models for each S-protein:ACE2
complex and selected the model with the lowest nDOPE69 score, which reflects the quality of
the model. Positive scores are likely to be poor models, while scores lower than -1 are likely
to be native-like. The sequence similarity of the human ACE2 and the mink ACE2 is fairly
high (83% amino-acid sequence identity) and all generated models were of high quality
(nDOPE < -1).

Measuring changes in the stability of the S-protein:ACE2 complex following mutation
We calculated the change in stability of the S-protein:ACE2 complex using two independent
methods. The first, HADDOCK70, is one of the top-performing protein-protein docking servers
in the CAPRI competition71. The HADDOCK scoring function uses linear combination of
various energies, van der waals, electrostatics and desolvation. We employed HADDOCK
(v2.4 web server) to score the complexes (Figure S9). We also calculated the change in the
stability of the S-protein:ACE2 complex using mCSM-PPI272 (Figure S10). This assigns a
graph-based signature vector to each mutation, which is then used within machine learning
models to predict the binding energy. The signature vector is based upon atom-distance patterns
in the wild-type protein, pharmacophore information and available experimental information,
evolutionary information and energetic terms. We used the mCSM-PPI2 server
(http://biosig.unimelb.edu.au/mcsm_ppi2/) for the simulations. These methods were used

because we found in a previous study that they reported stability changes, following mutations
in the S-protein:ACE2 complex, that correlated well with the available in vivo and in vitro
experimental data on susceptibility to infection29.

In particular we performed the following calculations:
1. Using the model of the mink ACE2:SARS-CoV-2 reference complex we mutated the target
residue to those RBD candidates identified in mink SARS-CoV-2.
2. Using the model of the mink ACE2:SARS-CoV-2 mink complex we mutated the target
residues to the human SARS-CoV-2 reference strain.
3. Using the structure of the human ACE2:SARS-CoV-2 reference we mutated the target
residue to those RBD candidates identified in mink SARS-CoV-2.
4. Using the model of the human ACE2:SARS-CoV-2 mink complex we mutated the target
residue to the human SARS-CoV-2 reference strain.

For HADDOCK, a value that is more negative than for the reference Wuhan-Hu-1 S-protein:
ACE2 complex suggests stabilisation of the complex. Whilst for mCSM-PPI-2 negative G
values reflect destabilisation of the complex by the mutation and positive values reflect
stabilisation of the complex.

We also evaluated structural changes for all combinations of RBD mutations and receptor
complexes (Figures S11-S13).

Results
Genomic diversity in mink SARS-CoV-2
At the time of writing (6th November 2020) 239 SARS-CoV-2 genome assemblies isolated
from minks were publicly available on GISAID48,49 and NCBI (Table S1) spanning a sampling
period of the 24th of April 2020 to the 16th of September 2020. An alignment across all mink
SARS-CoV-2 comprised 1073 Single Nucleotide Polymorphisms (SNPs) (Figure S1) with a
mean pairwise distance of 6.5 (range: 4.1 – 11.7) mutations between any two genomes. No
genome deviated from the reference genome, Wuhan-Hu-1 (NC_045512.2), by more than 24
mutations and the alignment exhibited a highly significant temporal signal (Figure S2).
Dynamic assignment of assemblies to lineages73 (run 6th November 2020) placed mink SARSCoV-2 into seven different SARS-CoV-2 lineages. All 12 genomes from mink farms in

Denmark fell into a single lineage: B.1.1. Both lineage assignments and phylogenetic
placement of mink SARS-CoV-2 in a large global phylogeny of human isolates are consistent
with multiple zoonotic jumps of SARS-CoV-2 from human to mink hosts seeding local farmrelated outbreaks37,38 (Figure 1, Tables S1-S2).

Across the mink SARS-CoV-2 alignment we observed a ratio of nonsynonymous to
synonymous changes of 1.84, in line with the previous estimate of 1.88 for SARS-COV-2
lineages circulating in humans24. A full list of all identified mutations is provided in Table S3
with nonsynonymous mutations displayed in Figures S3-S4. As previously reported for human
SARS-CoV-2, we observe marked compositional asymmetries in mink SARS-CoV-2 likely
deriving from the mutational action of host RNA-editing mechanisms24,74,75. For example, 37%
of all nonsynonymous mutations represent C→U changes (Figure S5). This results in 87% of

all possible nonsynonymous mutations involving a C being C→U changes, in line with C→U
changes also representing by far the most common mutations for SARS-CoV-2 strains
circulating in humans24,74,75. Though, the overall pattern of nucleotide substitutions is
statistically significantly different between strains circulating in humans and minks (p < 0.001),
with in particular a deficit of G→C and an excess of C→A mutations in minks (Figure S5).
SARS-CoV-2 genomes isolated from minks also showed a stronger depletion of CpG sites (p
= 2.2 x 10-16) relative to their counterparts circulating in humans (Figure S6).

Recurrent mutations in mink SARS-CoV-2
Across the masked alignment we detect 23 mutations that have appeared independently at least
twice in SARS-CoV2 circulating in minks, corresponding to a consistency index (CI) <0.560.
Of those 23 mutations, 16 comprise nonsynonymous and seven synonymous changes (Table
S4). Nonsynonymous mutations which have emerged independently at least three times include
one within Orf1ab (12,795 - G4177E), three within Orf3a (25,936 – H182Y; 26,047 – L219V;
26078 – T229I) and three within the spike protein (22,920 – Y453F; 23,018 – F486L; 23,064
– N501T). Of note the latter three recurrent mutations in the spike protein correspond to residue
changes in the SARS-CoV-2 spike RBD (Figure 2, Figure S4, Figure S7), which may be a
particularly important region for adaptation of SARS-CoV-2 to host receptors47. In particular,
we infer five independent emergences of Y453F across four lineages, five emergences of
F486L across three lineages and four emergences of N501T across three lineages.

Mutations specifically increasing transmission in minks can be expected to have emerged only
a limited number of times in SARS-CoV-2 strains circulating in humans and to have remained
at low frequency in the human SARS-CoV-2 population. Using a phylogenetic dataset of
>54,000 human SARS-CoV-2 genomes, we identify some overlap between sites homoplasic
in minks and in humans (Figure S8). This suggests that mutations having emerged recurrently
in viruses circulating in minks may not all reflect host adaptation but could also be the result
of mutations induced by vertebrate APOBEC proteins24,74,75. This is in line with the large
proportion of homoplasies involving C→T changes (12/23) consistent with know patterns of
hypermutation in vertebrates74 (Figure 2, Table S4). As such, we expect strong candidate
mutations for SARS-CoV-2 host adaptation to minks to be at low frequency in SARS-CoV-2
circulating in humans.

Following a screen of amino acid replacements in CoV-GLUE64 (accessed 16th November
2020) we found that all seven nonsynonymous mutations that have independently emerged at
least three times in strains circulating in minks are carried by fewer than ~0.3% of the SARSCoV-2 genomes isolated from humans available on large publicly available sequencing
repositories (Figure 2, Table S4). Of the mink homoplasies located in the spike protein, two
derive from A→T (nucleotide position 22920 – Y453F) and A→C (nucleotide position 23018
– F486L) changes while one corresponds to a T→C change (nucleotide position 23064 –
N501T). The recurrent emergence of these mutations in phylogenetically distant lineages, and
their relative scarcity in SARS-CoV-2 samples circulating in humans, further supports these as
strong candidates for ongoing host-adaptation of the virus to transmission in minks. Indeed,
many of the cases identified in humans seem putatively linked to mink farm outbreaks in the
Netherlands and Denmark37,38,76 (Figure 2c).

Predicted impact of recurrent mutations in the spike protein
Having observed the presence of three candidate mutations falling within the SARS-CoV-2
spike RBD we considered their role in receptor binding affinity as putative sites of adaptation
to a mink host. The spike RBD (codon positions 319-54177) provides a critical region for
SARS-CoV-2 to attach to host cells via docking to ACE2 receptors, thereby allowing
subsequent SARS-CoV-2 entry into host cells and eventual replication46,47. This also makes
the RBD the target of neutralising antibodies78–81, i.e. antibodies preventing cellular infection
upon prior exposure to the pathogen or a vaccine. Specific residues within the RBD have been
identified as critical for receptor binding29,82,83, with potential to modulate both infectivity and
antigenicity77. All three recurrent spike RBD mutations (Y453F, F486L and N501T) suggested
by the phylogenetic analyses are in residues directly involved in contacts in the Sprotein:ACE2 interface and are therefore relevant to the binding and stability of the complex
(Figure 3).

binding domain are shown in teal, red and green respectively. The wild-type amino acid
residues for the recurrent nonsynonymous mutations Y453F, F486L, N501T are shown in
purple. The ACE2 residues reported previously to be interacting with the RBM residues L455
(in close proximity to F453), F486 and N501 are shown in blue. The Protein Data Bank (PDB)
code for the SARS-CoV-2 RBM–ACE2 complex is 6M0J. This figure was rendered using
PyMOL (v2.4.1).
We used the HADDOCK70 and mCSM-PPI272 protocols to analyse the change in stability of
the mink SARS-CoV-2 S-protein:ACE2 complex for the three recurrent spike RBD mutations.
To analyse the changes in stability we used 3D-models of the mink ACE2 bound to SARSCoV-2 mink strain and then mutated the target residue to that found in human-associated
reference SARS-CoV-2. We used this approach as previous work showed that it gave results
that correlated well with experimental data on susceptibility to infection 29. However, we got
similar results when we performed the calculation by using the complex of the mink ACE2
bound to SARS-CoV-2 Wuhan-Hu-1 and mutated the target SARS-CoV-2 residue to those
observed in minks (Figure S9-S10). The results indicate marginal changes in the stability of
the complex for these mutations and are somewhat conflicting between the methods, but none
of the values reported is expected to significantly stabilise or destabilise the complex.

Structural analyses
In light of the small estimated changes in binding energy associated with complex stabilities,
additional structural analyses were performed to gain further insights into whether the
mutations were likely to affect complex stability. The first of the candidate residues 453

(nucleotide position 22920) lies close to the centre of the S-protein:ACE2 interface. In WuhanHu-1 the tyrosine at this position interacts with H34 in human ACE2 enabling the formation
of a polar hydrogen bond which would stabilise the complex. In the American mink ACE2,
position 34 has a tyrosine residue which would lead to a clash with the polar tyrosine 453 for
Wuhan-Hu-1 SARS-CoV-2. Therefore the emergence of mutation of Y453 to a phenyalanine,
observed in 47 mink associated SARS-CoV-2 (Table S3), could be favourable as it reduces
the clash of polar groups (see Figure S11).

The SARS-CoV-2 spike residue 486 (nt position 23018) has been identified as one of the most
important locations – ‘the receptor binding motif’ - for human ACE2 binding to the spike
protein82,83 and lies within a hydrophobic pocket (Figure S12). It has been shown that SARSCoV-2 exploits this pocket better than SARS-CoV-1, as the phenylalanine residue allows for
pi stacking of the aromatic rings with Y83 in human ACE2 which enhances affinity65,82,83. Our
previous analysis29 showed the Y83 residue to be highly conserved across human and other
animals including the American mink. While we note that this residue change arises from a
T→C transition (Figure 2), this polymorphism has appeared at least five times and was
observed in 96 mink associated SARS-CoV-2. Mutation of phenylalanine to leucine replaces
the large aromatic ring with an aliphatic leucine which is not involved in any substantive
interactions with the Y83 (see Figure S12).

Our final candidate, N501T (nt position 23064) is only observed in five mink SARS-CoV-2
but has independently emerged four times (Table S4). This residue change has been observed
in only ten human SARS-CoV-2 assemblies to date (Figure 2). The recurrent mutation leads
to the replacement of the asparagine by a threonine residue in the mink associated strain
(Figure S13). This gives rise to a hydrogen bond to lysine 353 which may contribute to the
small increase in stability reported by mCSM-PPI2 (Figure S10).

Discussion
The COVID-19 pandemic is understood to have been caused by a unique host jump into
humans from a single yet-undescribed zoonotic source in the latter half of 2019 most likely in
China2,3,61. This created a situation where the entire genetic diversity of the SARS-CoV-2
population was initially negligible despite the virus having rapidly swept across the world.
Genetic diversity has been building up since the start of the pandemic through the acquisition
of new mutations, but is still limited relative to other RNA viruses with broad distributions.
Conversely, the secondary host jump into minks involved multiple independent secondary
transmissions into mink farms in different countries. Whilst the data we analysed represents
only a subset of infected mink farms from just two countries, the Netherlands and Denmark,
we already identify a minimum of seven independent host jumps from humans to minks,
involving strains representative of essentially the entire SARS-CoV-2 lineage diversity in
circulation (Figure 1).

The secondary transmissions of SARS-CoV-2 from humans into minks provides a set of
‘natural experiments’ to identify mutations involved in the adaptation of the virus to a novel
host. By analysing SARS-CoV-2 isolated from minks, we recovered 23 mutations having
independently emerged multiple times. By restricting this set to the nonsynonymous mutations
that have appeared at least three times in mink, we identify seven variants that are strong
candidates for host adaptation to minks (Figure 2, Table S4). These seven candidates comprise
a recurrent change in nsp9 of Orf1ab, a region involved in mediating viral replication84, as well
as the repeat emergence of three mutations in Orf3a, a protein thought to play an important role
in triggering host inflammatory response85,86.

We particularly focus on the three candidates that have emerged independently in minks at
least four times in the RBD of the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein, a region vital for determining
host-range47 (Figure 2, Figure S4). We detect at least five independent emergences of Y453F
across four phylogenetic lineages, five emergences of F486L across three lineages and four
emergences of N501T across three lineages in minks. It is noteworthy that all three mutations
are not, or only marginally homoplasic, in humans and all three have also been observed at low
frequency in strains circulating in human COVID-19 infections which have been intensively
sampled; ~150,000 high quality genome assemblies are available on GISAID at the time of
writing (Table S4, Figure 2).

Quantifying the consequences of these candidate RBD mutations on the binding affinity of the
SARS-CoV-2 spike protein to human and mink ACE2 receptors we predict only subtle changes
in S-protein:ACE2 complex stability for Y453F and F486L (Figure S9-S10). Consistently,
characterisation of mutated variants in the RBD region suggest the region has a high tolerance
to mutation in the context of receptor binding87 and we note that previous studies have shown
that animals are susceptible to infection by SARS-CoV2 despite much higher destabilisation
of the complex than reported for these mutants29,30,88. A published approach based on
fluorescent detection of ACE2 binding reports negative binding constants for F486L though

We also identify structural support for a marginal increase in stability of the mink complex
with the N501T mutation relative to wild type (Figure S10, Figure S13). In our dataset we
detect the presence of this mutation in five mink SARS-CoV-2 though this corresponds to at
least four independent emergences, with N501T being exceptionally rare in human infections
(Figure 2). It may also be relevant that a different residue change in this position (N501Y) has
been proposed as a mechanism of host adaption in mice infected with SARS-CoV-289
suggesting the broader role of residue changes at 501 as relevant affinity enhancing
mutations87.

In addition to adaptation to a novel host through acquisition of new variants, RNA viruses are
also under pressure of their hosts’ immune system which comprises antiviral mechanisms such
as APOBEC proteins inducing hypermutation at specific sites in their genome74,75. While C→U
changes, most likely induced by proteins from the APOBEC family, represent the majority of
mutations in SARS-CoV-2 circulating both in minks and humans, we also detected subtle shifts
in mutational patterns likely due to differences in the innate immune system of humans and
minks (Figure S5-S6). The widespread depletion of CpG sites in RNA viruses can also be
explained by another defense mechanism in the vertebrate innate immune system, in the form
of Zinc-Finger Antiviral Proteins (ZAPs), which target viral RNA for exosome-mediated
degradation90,91. There have been earlier suggestions that ZAPs from different vertebrate host
taxa may exert varying levels of CpG depletion pressure92,93. In this context, it is an intriguing
observation that SARS-CoV-2 genomes isolated from minks displayed a moderate but
statistically highly significant depletion of CpG sites (p = 2.2 x 10-16) relative to their
counterparts circulating in humans (Figure S6).

A combination of biological and epidemiological factors make mink farms highly susceptible
to SARS-CoV-2 outbreaks with the risk of subsequent transmission back into humans37,38,94.
As such, mink farms represent reservoirs for the virus which can greatly complicate the
containment of COVID-19. At the time of writing a further 214 mink associated human
COVID-19 infections were reported in the North Jutland region of Denmark, highlighting the
risk of spill-overs from animal reservoirs (announced 5th November 2020, working paper
available https://files.ssi.dk/Mink-cluster-5-short-report_AFO2 accessed 12th November
2020)76. A phylogenetic grouping of the virus termed ‘Cluster 5’ circulating in North Jutland
has attracted particular attention. This cluster is reported to carry our Y453F candidate
mutation, together with three other mutations in the spike protein falling outside the RBD
(del69-70, I692V, M1229I), none of which we identify as mink-adapted. The cluster 5 lineage
is known to have infected up to 12 people and its spread led to the Danish Government
considering closing all mink farms in the country. The putative impact on antigen-escape of
the Y453F mutation remains under study, though appears moderate76.

Our work points to the frequent emergence of adaptive mutations in minks which may be
retained during anthroponotic spillovers, at least transiently so. To date, the vast majority of
mutations that have been observed in SARS-CoV-2 appear selectively neutral, or even
deleterious in humans24,95 and those which we identify as strong candidates for host-adaptation
to minks have remained at low frequency globally in human SARS-CoV-2 to date (Figure 2).
There is no a priori reason to expect that mutations adaptive in minks will lead to any marked
change in the dynamic of human COVID-19 infections. Indeed, SARS-CoV-2 lineages
carrying candidate mutations adaptive to transmission in minks have been sequenced since the
first outbreaks of SARS-CoV-2 on mink farms in April 2020, with the first mink SARS-CoV2 sample carrying Y453F dating back to the 24th April 2020.

The low prevalence of mink-adapted candidate mutations in strains in circulation in humans to
date (November 2020) suggests they are not expected to increase transmission of the virus in
humans. However, mutations located within the RBD of the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein do
warrant careful monitoring. Genetic variation in the RBD region is common and studies of
related Sarbecoviruses have previously identified signals consistent with complex selection
histories in this region2,10,96,97. The RBD is the most immunodominant region of the SARSCoV-2 genome and any mutation in this region therefore has potential implications for

antigenic response78–81. The spike RBD is also the target of antibody based therapies and
vaccines98–101. In this context, it may seem concerning that Y453F has been flagged as as a
possible vaccine-escape mutation102. Though our work suggests this mutation is an adaptive
change specifically enhancing transmission in minks. Other RBD variants, already found at
higher frequency in human SARS-CoV-2, represent stronger candidates for vaccine-escape
mutations103,104. Once vaccines will be deployed, careful characterisation and tracking of the
frequency of such mutations will be essential to inform if and when vaccines will need to be
redesigned. This critical effort will be greatly enabled by open genomic data sharing
platforms48,49,64,105.
