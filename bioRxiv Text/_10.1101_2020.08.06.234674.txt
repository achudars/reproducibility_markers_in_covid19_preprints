Abstract
Vaccine efforts against the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV2) responsible for the current COVID-19 pandemic are focused on SARS-CoV-2 spike
glycoprotein, the primary target for neutralizing antibodies. Here, we performed cryo-EM
and site-specific glycan analysis of one of the leading subunit vaccine candidates from
Novavax based on a full-length spike protein formulated in polysorbate 80 (PS 80)
detergent. Our studies reveal a stable prefusion conformation of the spike immunogen
with slight differences in the S1 subunit compared to published spike ectodomain
structures. Interestingly, we also observed novel interactions between the spike trimers
allowing formation of higher order spike complexes. This study confirms the structural
integrity of the full-length spike protein immunogen and provides a basis for interpreting
immune responses to this multivalent nanoparticle immunogen.

Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) caused a global outbreak
from 2002-2003 causing severe pneumonia and killing almost 900 people (1). SARSCoV-2, belongs to the same lineage of the β-CoV genus as SARS-CoV, and recently
emerged in China, spreading rapidly and infecting more than 18 million people worldwide
with cases continuing to rise each day (2). Given the global increase in population density,
urbanization, and mobility, and the uncertain future behavior of the virus, vaccination is a
critical tool for the response to this pandemic. The SARS-CoV-2 spike (S) trimeric
glycoprotein is a focus of coronavirus vaccine development since it is a major component
of the virus envelope, essential for receptor binding and virus entry, and a major target of
host immune defense (3, 4). There are several currently ongoing efforts to make spikebased vaccines using different strategies (4-6).
The CoV S protein is synthesized as an inactive precursor (S0) that gets
proteolytically cleaved into S1 and S2 subunits which remain non-covalently linked to form
functional prefusion trimers (7). Like other type 1 fusion proteins, the SARS-CoV-2 S
prefusion trimer is metastable and undergoes large-scale structural rearrangement from
a prefusion to a thermostable post fusion conformation upon S-protein receptor binding
and cleavage (8, 9). Rearrangement exposes the hydrophobic fusion peptide (FP)
allowing insertion into the host cell membrane, facilitating virus/host cell membrane
alignment, fusion, and virus entry. Notably, SARS-CoV-2 S has a 4 amino acid insertion
(PRRA) in the S1/S2 cleavage site compared to SARS-CoV spike resulting in a polybasic
RRAR furin-like cleavage motif that enhances infection of lung cells (10, 11). While the
S2 subunit is relatively more conserved across the β-CoV genus, the S1 subunit
comprising the receptor binding domain (RBD) is immunodominant and much less

conserved (12). The FP, two heptad repeats (HR1 and HR2), transmembrane (TM)
domain, and cytoplasmic tail (CT) are located in the S2 subdomain that encompasses the
fusion machinery. The S1 subunit of SARS-CoV-2 S folds into 4 distinct domains; the Nterminal (NTD), the C-terminal domain (CTD) containing the RBD and two subdomains,
SD1 and SD2. While some human CoVs (HCoV), including OC43, exclusively use NTDsialic acid interactions as their receptor engagement, others like Middle East Respiratory
Syndrome (MERS) CoV that use the CTD-RBD for primary receptor binding have also
been reported to bind sialic acid receptors via their NTD to aid initial attachment to the
host cells (13-15). Although SARS-CoV-2 primarily interacts with its receptor ACE2
through the CTD-RBD, there is currently no evidence indicating possible interactions
between the NTD and sialoglycans (16, 17).
The structure of the stabilized SARS-CoV-2 spike ectodomain has been solved in
its prefusion conformation and exhibits a high resemblance to SARS-CoV spike (17-19).
In this report, we describe the atomic structure of a leading SARS-CoV-2 S vaccine
candidate based on a full-length S gene with furin cleavage-resistant mutations in the
S1/S2 cleavage site and the presence or absence of 2-proline amino acid substitutions
at the apex of the central helix. Our studies reveal an overall shift in conformation of the
S1 subunit compared to the previously published structures (17-19). Interestingly, we also
observed direct interactions between adjacent spike trimers; the flexible loop between
residues 615-635 in the SD2 from each trimer extending and engaging a binding pocket
on the NTD of the adjacent trimers resulting in higher order spike multimers. Further, sitespecific glycan analysis revealed the glycan occupancy as well as varying levels of glycan
processing at the 22 N-glycosylation sequons present in the spike monomer. Thus, our

studies provide in-depth structural analysis of the Novavax full-length vaccine candidate,
currently being tested in humans, that appropriately recapitulates the prefusion spike.

Design and validation of SARS-CoV-2-3Q-2P full-length spike
The SARS-CoV-2-3Q-2P full-length spike vaccine candidate (3Q-2P-FL) was
engineered from the full-length SARS-CoV-2 spike gene (residues 1-1273) including the
transmembrane domain (TM) and the cytoplasmic tail (CT) (Fig1a). The construct was
modified at the S1/S2 polybasic cleavage site from RRAR to QQAQ to render it protease
resistant along with 2 proline substitutions at residues K986 and V987 in the S2 fusion
machinery core for enhanced stability (Figure 1A). A second full-length construct (3Q-FL)
containing the cleavage site mutations but without the 2 proline substitutions was also
made in parallel for comparative purposes. The FL spikes expressed and purified from
insect cells were then formulated in 0.01% (v/v) polysorbate 80 (PS 80) detergent. To
characterize the structural integrity of 3Q-2P-FL immunogen, we performed negative stain
electron microscopy (nsEM) of the FL spike constituted in PS 80 in the presence of MatrixM adjuvant, recapitulating the vaccine formulation being tested in humans. Micrographs
and 2D classes of the particles revealed trimeric spike proteins present as free trimers or
as multi-trimer rosettes with their transmembrane domains enclosed in cylindrical micellar
cores of PS 80 detergent (Figure 1B). Micrographs show these 3Q-2P-FL spike
nanoparticles containing as many as 14 trimers. The Matrix-M adjuvant can also be seen
in the micrographs and 2D classes as spherical cages of different sizes with only very
limited interaction with spike particles.

Cryo-EM of SARS-CoV-2-3Q-2P spike
To further evaluate the structural features of the 3Q-2P-FL immunogen, we
performed single particle cryo-EM on the spike formulated in PS 80 detergent. The raw
micrographs from cryo-EM revealed free trimers and trimer rosettes similar to those
observed on the negative stain micrographs (Figure 2A). Initial 2D classifications revealed
the presence of 2 distinct classes: free spike trimers and dimers of trimers (Figure 2A).
Each class was independently subjected to additional classification and refinement.
The three-fold symmetry (C3) reconstruction of the free spike trimer resulted in a
map of 3.6 Å resolution while the asymmetric reconstruction (C1) was resolved to 3.8 Å
resolution (Figure 2B and S1A, S1B). Previously published structures of soluble,
stabilized SARS-CoV-2 spikes have revealed that RBDs exist in either a closed (RBDdown) or an open (RBD-up) conformation that can engage in ACE2 binding (16-18). In
contrast, we observed that all three RBDs on the 3Q-2P-FL spike trimer were present in
the closed conformation in the asymmetric reconstruction; the higher resolution C3 map
was consequently used for model building (Figure 2B and S1C). Overall, the map was
well resolved in both S1 and S2 subunits, particularly in the S1 NTD and CTD domains
that were less resolved in previously published structures, thereby enabling us to model
the full extent of these domains. Notably, the local resolution map calculated using
cryoSPARC showed much of the spike trimer at substantially higher resolution than 3.6
Å (Figure S1D). The atomic model contains residues 14-1146 with breaks only in the
flexible loop (619-631) and the cleavage site (678-688) (Figure 2C). Interestingly,
superimposition of the coordinate models of 3Q-2P-FL spike with published spike
structures (PDB Id: 6VXX and 6VSB) revealed substantial domain rearrangements in the

S1 subunit of 3Q-2P-FL spike compared to the other models, whereas the structure of
the S2 subunit was consistent with the published data (Figure 2D). The S1 NTD differed
the most (~14° rotation counterclockwise relative to published models when viewing down
towards the viral membrane) while the CTD and subdomains showed minor local
rearrangements (Figure 2D). Notably, we also observed shifts in the placement of
residues flanking the 615-635 loop compared to the published models. This region was
modeled in one of the published structures (PDB Id: 6X6P) as a helix with residues
flanking the helix positioned very differently from our model as shown by the
corresponding placement of residues T632 and T618 (residues flanking the gap in 3Q2P-FL model) (Figure 3A). However, upon closer inspection of the cryo-EM density (EMD22078) corresponding to residues 621-640 of the PDB model 6X6P, there is insufficient
density to support the helix conformation of this region (Figure S1E). The resulting
displacement of residues in the 3Q-2P-FL structure enables inter-protomeric interactions
by creating a salt-bridge between residues Asp 614 and Lys 854 (Figure 3B). This
observation is particularly interesting given the increased prevalence of D614G mutation
in the emerging SARS-CoV-2 strains and its potential role in viral transmission and
pathogenesis (20).
During refinement of an atomic model into the EM density, we observed 2
additional densities in the S1 subunit that did not correspond to any peptide or glycans
within the spike (Figure S2A). The first density was buried within a hydrophobic pocket of
the CTD created by F338, F342, Y365, Y369, F374, F377, F392, F513 (Figure 3C and
S2B). We had previously observed a non-protein density situated in the structure of
porcine epidemic diarrhea virus (PEDV) that was identified to be palmitoleic acid (21).

This pocket in SARS-CoV-2 CTD corresponded with the structure of linoleic acid, a
polyunsaturated fatty acid; the presence of this ligand was confirmed by mass
spectrometry of 3Q-2P-FL spike (Figure S2B and S2C). The main chain carboxyl group
of linoleic acid interacts with R408 and Q409 residues of RBD from the adjacent protomer
thereby making interprotomer contacts (Figure 3C). The second unassigned density
present in NTD was relatively larger and more surface exposed than the first density,
surrounded by residues N121, Y170, S172, F175, R190, H207, V227 (Figure 3D and
S2D). Analysis of the structural features of this density suggested that it may correspond
to PS 80 detergent used to solubilize the membrane-bound trimers and stabilize them in
solution. The aliphatic tail of PS 80 fit well into the hydrophobic pocket while the carbonyl
and hydroxyl groups were well placed in proximity to residues R190 and H207 with
potential for multiple hydrogen bonds between them (Figure 3D and S2D). Overall, the
density is consistent with PS 80 detergent and, given its location, provides a possible
explanation for the S1 shift seen in our FL trimer density compared to the published
structures.

Structures of dimer-of-trimers and trimer-of-trimers
Further classification of multimeric trimer particles yielded two separate classes; a dimerof-trimers class that reconstructed to a final resolution of 4.5 Å with 2-fold symmetry and
a trimer-of-trimers class that was resolved to 8.0 Å resolution (Figure 4A, 4B and S3A).
The presence of the trimer-of-trimers class revealed that each spike trimer had the ability
to interact with multiple trimers simultaneously. In both reconstructions, the interaction
between each pair of trimers involved the SD2 of one protomer from each trimer engaging

with the NTD of the adjacent trimer (Figure 4C). Consequently, each trimer pair is
symmetrical along a 2-fold axis with trimer axes tilted to 44.5 degrees relative to each
other. The atomic model of the dimer-of-trimer EM density revealed that the interaction
was mainly coordinated by the 615-635 loop. Although most of the loop residues were
too flexible to resolve in the free trimer density map, the inter-trimer interaction stabilized
the loop so that it could be fully resolved (Figure 4D). The loop reaches into a pocket on
the adjacent NTD, interacting with residues 621-PVAIHADQ-628 in the loop with NTD
residues Q183, H146, Y248, L249, V70 and S71 (Figure 4D). We observed subtle
changes in the NTD binding pocket in the loop-bound state compared to the free trimer
model that allow better accommodation of the loop in the pocket. The residues Y145 and
H146 in the binding pocket appear to switch positions in the loop-bound state resulting in
a salt bridge interaction between H146 and D627 and potential stacking between W152
and H146 (Figure 4E). We also observed minor displacement of residues 68-75 and 248250 surrounding the pocket. In addition to the main loop interaction resulting in higherorder oligomers, we also observed N282 glycans extending out towards the symmetry
related chain in the adjacent trimer (Figure S3B). Parts of the glycans are stabilized and
visible in the dimer-of-trimers map. Due to the close proximity, these glycans might form
hydrogen bonds with the symmetry related chain but it is unclear if these glycan
interactions aid in the stability of the dimer-of-trimers.
To investigate if the residues involved in trimer-trimer interactions are conserved
across CoV strains belonging to lineage B of betacoronaviruses, we performed sequence
alignment of residues in the loop and corresponding NTD binding pocket across
representative strains (Figure S3C). While the loop residues 621-PVAIHADQ-628 are well

conserved across strains, we observed varying levels of conservation in the binding
pocket with SARS-CoV exhibited the most variability. SARS-CoV-2 has 7 additional
residues at position 70-76 (including V70 and S71), 4 additional residues at position at
150-153 and 6 additional residues at 247-252 (including Y248 and L249) compared to
SARS-CoV. These insertions along with the absence of H146 at the corresponding site
on SARS-CoV make it unlikely for SARS-CoV to participate in these inter-trimeric
interactions seen in SARS-CoV-2. While the residues in the NTD pocket were almost
identical between SARS-CoV-2 and its closely related bat strain Bat-SL-RatG13, we
observed some residue differences and 1-3 amino acid deletions in the loops comprising
the

BetaCoV/pangolin/Guandong/1/2019 and BetaCoV/pangolin/Guangxi/P4L/2007 that
could potentially impact binding to the loop (Figure S3C).
Due to the proximity of this binding pocket to the putative glycan binding site, we
conducted structural comparisons of the NTD dimerization pocket with that of the sialic
acid (SA) binding site on MERS spike (PDB ID: 6Q04) (15). Comparison to MERS showed
that although the SA-binding pocket was in close proximity, it did not coincide with the
dimerization pocket on NTD (Figure S3D). While it has not been identified if SARS-CoV2 spike binds to glycans in a similar manner, computational and structural studies have
proposed residues on SARS-CoV-2 spike involved in SA binding (22, 23). Structural
comparison of this putative glycan binding site to the dimerization site revealed them
situated adjacent to one another with residues in loop 70 contributing to both the binding
pockets (Figure S3E).

To evaluate if the multimerization phenomenon observed in the full-length spike
construct played a role in virus replication, we performed pseudovirus replication assays
with SARS-CoV-2 wild-type (WT) spike and two mutant spikes. In mutant 1, the loop
residues 621-PVAIHADQ-628 were replaced with a glycine-serine linker to completely
knockout binding to NTD and in mutant 2, residues 619-EVPV-622 of SARS-CoV-2 were
reverted to residues 619-DVST-622 of SARS-CoV-1. Pseudoviruses containing either
WT or mutant spikes were generated in HEK293T cells and used to infect HeLa or HeLaACE2 cells. While the WT and mutant 2 exhibited similar levels of infection, we observed
no detectable levels of infection for mutant 1 in which all contact residues on the loop
were replaced by a GS linker (Figure 4F).

Structural comparison to SARS-CoV-2-3Q-FL spike
To investigate if the absence of 2 stabilizing proline mutations impacted the spike stability
and formation of higher order multimers, we performed cryo-EM studies of the SARSCoV-2-3Q-FL (without 2P) protein formulated in PS 80 detergent. The raw micrographs
and 2D classes revealed the presence of free trimers as well as trimer-trimer complexes
as observed with 3Q-2P-FL, indicating that the proline stabilization is not necessary for
the formation of these higher order complexes (Figure S4A). The 3D refinement of free
trimers was refined to 4 Å resolution imposing C3 symmetry as we observed that the
RBDs were present in closed conformation similar to 3Q-2P-FL (Figure S4B). Fitting the
3Q-2P-FL model into the 3Q-FL map revealed identical conformation of the spike protein
further supporting that the presence of 2P in the full-length immunogen does not lead to
any structural changes in the spike protein (Figure S4C).

Glycan occupancy and glycan processing
Glycans on viral glycoproteins play a wide role in protein folding, stability, immune
recognition and potentially in immune evasion. Site-specific glycosylation of the SARSCoV-2 prefusion spike protein produced in SF9 insect cells was analyzed using our
recently described mass spectrometry proteomics-based method, involving treatment
with proteases followed by sequential treatment with the endoglycosidases (Endo H and
PNGase F) to introduce mass signatures in peptides with N-linked sequons (Asn-XThr/Ser) to assess the extent of glycosylation and the degree of glycan processing from
high mannose/hybrid type to complex type (24). Although the method was developed to
assess the degree of processing of N-linked glycans in mammalian cells, it is also
applicable for analyzing glycosylation of SF9 insect cells. The primary differences in
glycan processing of N-linked glycans in SF9 insect cells are: 1) the production of
truncated paucimannose glycans, and 2) the potential to introduce either one (α1,6) or
two (α1,6/α1,3) fucose substitutions into the core GlcNAc attached to Asn. Although α1,3
fucose substitution is known to prevent cleavage by PNGase F (25), this is not a factor
when analyzing glycosylation from SF9 cells since they contain α1,6-fucosylatransferase,
which is found in mammalian cells, but only contain trace amounts α-1,3fucosyltransferase activity, if any (26). The paucimannose glycans are highly processed
like complex type glycans and not cleaved by EndoH, but are cleaved by PNGase F.
Thus, for SF9 insect cell-produced glycoproteins, the use of endoglycosidases to
introduce mass signatures is analogous to analysis of glycoproteins produced in
mammalian cells, with EndoH removing high mannose/hybrid glycans leaving a GlcNAc-

Asn (+203), followed by treatment with PNGase F in O 18 water which removes the
remaining paucimannose and complex type glycans and while converting Asn to Asp (+3),
and the Asn of unoccupied sites remains unaltered (+0).
Our analysis detected glycosylation at all 22 potential N-linked glycan sequons
present on SARS-CoV-2 spike (Figure 4G). Overall, there was high glycan occupancy of
over >98%, with only two sites, 603 and 657, more than 5% unoccupied. Interestingly, we
did not see clear glycan density at either 603 or 657 in the cryo-EM reconstruction of the

spike.

cryo-EM. The extensive site-specific glycan processing of the SARS-CoV-2 prefusion
spike protein in SF9 insect cells seen here is similar to that recently reported for the spike
protein produced in mammalian HEK293F cells (27).

Discussion
The coronavirus disease (COVID-19) caused by SARS-CoV-2 poses a serious
health threat and was declared a pandemic by the World Health Organization (WHO). In
quick response to this rapidly evolving situation, several SARS-CoV-2 spike-based
vaccine candidates are being developed and tested at various stages of clinical trials (46). In this study, we performed structural analysis of the Novavax SARS-CoV-2-3Q-2P
full-length immunogen formulated in polysorbate 80 detergent. Our results show that PS
80 forms detergent micelles around the transmembrane domains of 1 or more spike
proteins, enabling the formation of nanoparticle-like rosettes. These larger nanoparticles
provide multivalent display of the spike immunogen with potential for better immunogen
trafficking and B-cell activation as has been previously shown for nanoparticle-based
immunogens (28-30). Consistent with this observation, analysis of safety and
immunogenicity of the Novavax SARS-CoV-2-3Q-2P-FL immunogen in mice and
baboons revealed strong B- and T-cell responses to the vaccine with no evidence of
vaccine-associated enhanced respiratory disease (VAERD) (31).
Structural analysis of the 3Q-2P full-length spike immunogen revealed several
important findings. The first being the stabilization and shift of the S1 subunit compared
to published structures (17, 18). Although the cause of this shift is unclear, the presence
of PS 80 wedged in the NTD potentially may stabilize the alternate conformation. Notably,
another recent study observed differences in their NTD conformations as a function of pH
(32). We also observed intertrimer interactions between SARS-CoV-2 full-length spike
proteins for the first time. The 615-635 loop that is generally disordered in free trimers,
engages the NTD of the adjacent trimer in a well-ordered conformation. The binding

pocket on NTD is present adjacent to the putative glycan binding site and shows subtle
differences in the apo and loop-bound conformations. The slight displacement of loop
residues 68-75 and the reversed positions of Y145 and H146 in the bound state not only
allow better accommodation of the loop in the pocket, but also enable the formation of
salt bridge interactions between H146 and D627. Importantly, both these findings were
seen in the full-length spike immunogen assembled into compact and dense
nanoparticles, which may play a role in both the observed S1 shift as well as formation of
higher order spike multimers. Cryo-electron tomographic reconstructions of intact SARSCoV-2 virions showed a relatively dispersed distribution of spike protein trimers on the
viral surface and no evidence of higher order aggregates (33). However, another study
has shown that the D614G mutation present in close proximity to the dimerization loop
results in a several fold increase of spike numbers on the viral surface, resulting in higher
spike protein density and a more infectious virion (20). The greater density may be aided
by the ability to form such higher order multimers and may also serve to block access to
epitopes on the more conserved S2 component of the spike, thereby facilitating immune
evasion. Alternatively, loop that mediates inter-spike interactions may play a role in viral
viability, consistent with our data showing that replacement of the loop with a GS linker
completely abrogated viral infectivity.
We also observed two non-spike densities within the spike trimer that
corresponded with linoleic acid and polysorbate 80 detergent. Linoleic acid, an essential
free fatty acid, was buried within a hydrophobic pocket in the CTD with its main chain
carboxyl group making contacts with the adjacent RBD in closed conformation. A recent
report by Toelzer et al. also identified this density and attributed it to the presence of

linoleic acid (34). The second large density occupied by PS 80 is situated in the NTD and
is relatively more surface exposed. Since PS 80 is unique to the formulation of the
Novavax 3Q-2P-FL immunogen, this observation is specific to this structure. However,
there is a possibility of other ligands occupying this pocket in the place of PS 80. The
presence of these binding pockets for different ligands in the spike structure provide
potential targets for drug design against SARS-CoV-2.
The widely used SARS-CoV-2 spike ectodomain construct with mutated cleavage
site and 2P substitution has been shown to partially exist in all RBD ‘down’ conformation
or in one RBD ‘up’ conformation (17, 18). Surprisingly, we observed that all the RBDs in
the 3Q-2P-FL spike immunogen were present in a down confirmation, which could be a
cause for concern for eliciting neutralizing antibodies that compete with ACE2 binding.
However, binding analysis of the 3Q-2P-FL immunogen to ACE2 by both bio-layer
interferometry and ELISA clearly show binding to ACE2, indicating that the RBD is
dynamic and the receptor binding site accessible (31). Another study on the prefusion
structure of a full-length spike protein reported similar findings with RBDs clamped down
as a consequence of potential clashes between S2 residues 828-853 and SD1 when RBD
is in open conformation (35). It is also possible that the interprotomeric contacts made by
linoleic acid observed in our structure preferentially lead to the observed RBD positioning.
Toelzer et al. also saw a preference for their structure with linoleic acid to be in the ‘down’
state (34). Recent reports by Henderson et al. have revealed that mutations at certain
positions can alter the propensity toward ‘up’ and ‘down’ states of the RBD (36, 37). They
showed that introducing a disulphide bond between RBD and S2 at positions S383 and
D985 stabilized the spike in an all RBD-down conformation while introducing other

mutations in SD1 and S2 could alter the number of RBDs present in the ‘up’ conformation
(36). Alternatively, the removal of N-linked glycosylation at positions 165 and 234 also
resulted in an increase or decrease in the populations of spikes in the ‘up’ state,
respectively (37).
Our structural work is consistent with the burgeoning body of structures available
of the spike protein, albeit with the important differences described above. Hence, this
advanced protein subunit vaccine candidate currently being tested in humans appears
stable, homogeneous, and locked in the antigenically preferred prefusion conformation.
Further, the tight clustering of the spikes in the nanoparticle formulation may lead to
stronger immune responses over soluble trimers alone, consistent with other viral
glycoprotein immunogens (HA and RSV F) (38, 39). It appears that the remarkable speed
at which this vaccine was designed did not compromise the quality of the immunogen,
and that building off the previous success in formulating RSV F and influenza HA
nanoparticle immunogens could readily be extended to SARS-CoV-2 spike, particularly
in the background of the 2P mutations previously shown to stabilize many other β-CoV
spikes (40). With structural, biophysical, and antigenic characterization now complete,
evaluation in humans will provide the true proof-of-principle for this vaccine concept.

SUPPLEMENTARY MATERIALS
Materials and Methods
Recombinant full-length SARS-CoV-2 prefusion S. SARS-CoV-2 full-length constructs
were synthesized from the S glycoprotein gene sequence (GenBank MN908947
nucleotides 21563-25384). The wild-type full-length gene was codon optimized for
expression in Spodoptera frugiperda (Sf9) cells by GenScript (Piscataway, NJ, USA).
Amino acid mutations in the S1/S2 cleavage domain were introduced in the furin cleavage
site (RRAR to QQAQ) to be protease resistant (SARS-CoV-2 3Q S) and in a second
construct two proline mutations (K986P and V987P) were introduced in the HR1 domain
(SARS-CoV-2 3Q-2P S) to stabilize the envelope proteins in a prefusion conformation
(18).

Expression and purification. For expression of SARS-CoV-2 full-length spike (S)
proteins, the synthetic S-genes were codon optimized for insect cells, cloned into the
pBac1 baculovirus transfer vector (Millipore, Sigma), and co-transfected into S. frugiperda
[Lepidoptera] Sf9 cells with the flashBACTM GOLD system (Oxford Expression
Technologies) using X-tremeGENE HP transfection reagent (Roche).

Recombinant

baculovirus-infected cells were harvested by centrifugation, SARS-CoV-2 S envelope
proteins extracted with non-ionic detergent and purified using anion exchange and lentil
lectin affinity column chromatography. Purified SARS-CoV-2 3Q and 3Q-2P S proteins
were dialyzed in 25 mM sodium phosphate (pH 7.2), 300 mM NaCl, 0.01% (v/v)
polysorbate 80 (PS 80) and stored at -80o C.

Ns-EM sample preparation and data collection. Equal concentrations of SARS-CoV2-3Q-2P full-length spike formulated in PS80 and Matrix adjuvant were diluted to
approximately 20 µg/mL with TBS. The sample was directly deposited onto carbon-coated
400-mesh copper grids and stained immediately with 2% (w/v) uranyl formate for 90
seconds. Grids were imaged at 120 KeV on Tecnai T12 Spirit with a 4k x 4k Eagle CCD
camera at 52,000x magnification and -1.5 μm nominal defocus. Micrographs were
collected using Leginon and the images were transferred to Appion for processing (41,
42). Particle stacks were generated in Appion with particles picked using a difference-ofGaussians picker (DoG-picker) and 2D classes generated by MSA/MRA (43, 44).

Cryo-EM sample preparation. For SARS-CoV-2 3Q-2P, 3.5 µL of spike at 0.4 mg/mL
was mixed with 0.5 µL of 0.04 mM lauryl maltose neopentyl glycol (LMNG) solution
immediately before sample deposition onto a 1.2/1.3 300-Gold grid (EMS) that had been
plasma cleaned for 7 seconds using a Gatan Solarus 950 Plasma system. Following
sample application, grids were blotted for 3 seconds before being vitrified in liquid ethane
using a Vitrobot Mark IV (Thermo Fisher). For SARS-CoV-2 3Q, 3.5 µL of spike at 0.5
mg/mL was mixed with 0.5 µL of 0.04 mM of LMNG and frozen in a similar manner.

Cryo-EM data collection and processing. For collection, a Talos Arctica TEM at 200
kV was used with a Gatan K2 Summit detector at a magnification of 36,000x, resulting in
a 1.15 Å pixel size. Total exposure was split into 250 ms frames with a total cumulative
dose of ∼50 e-/Å2. Micrographs were collected through Leginon software at a nominal
defocus range of -0.5 µm to -1.6 µm for 3Q-2P spike and at a defocus range of -0.4 µm

to -2.3 µm for 3Q spike (45). MotionCor2 was used for alignment and dose weighting of
the frames (46). Micrographs were transferred to CryoSPARC 2.9 for further processing
(47). CTF estimations were performed using GCTF and micrographs were selected using
the Curate Exposures tool in CryoSPARC based on their CTF resolution estimates (cutoff
5 Å) for downstream particle picking, extraction and iterative rounds of 2D classification
and selection (48). Particles selected from 2D classes were used for 3D refinement of
free trimers for 3Q-2P-FL and 3Q-FL datasets in CryoSPARC. Final subsets of clean
trimer particles were refined with C3 symmetry and local resolution for the free trimer was
calculated using the local resolution function in CryoSPARC. Particles corresponding to
dimers-of-trimers classes in CryoSPARC were transferred to Relion 3.0 for iterative
rounds of 3D classification to separate dimers-of-trimers and trimers-of-trimers (49). Final
subsets of clean particles from dimers-of-trimers class were refined with C2 symmetry
and the trimers-of-trimers class with C1 symmetry.

Model building and refinement. The 3.6 Å C3-symmetric free trimer map and the 4.5 Å
C2-symmetric dimers-of-trimers maps were used for model building and refinement. Initial
model building was performed manually in Coot using PDB 6VXX as a template followed
by iterative rounds of Rosetta relaxed refinement and Coot manual refinement to generate
the final models (50, 51). EMRinger and MolProbity were run following each round of
Rosetta refinement to evaluate and choose the best refined models (52, 53). To prepare
linoleic acid and PS 80 detergent ligands for modeling, PDB and CIF ligand definition files
were created using Phenix eLBOW (54) by providing the SMILES string for PubChem
CID: 5284448 (polysorbate 80) or the PDB chemical component code EIC (linoleic acid).

The coordinates were manually placed and refined into the respective map densities
using Coot. For Rosetta refinement, each ligand was saved in MOL2 format and Rosetta
parameter files were generated using the molfile_to_params.py function (51). Final map
and model statistics are summarized in Table S1. Figures were generated using UCSF
Chimera and UCSF Chimera X (55, 56).

Mass-spectrometry. Mass spectrometry to identify fatty acids in the SARS-3Q-2P-FL
protein was performed as described previously (21). We obtained several candidates in
this screen that were narrowed down to 6 candidates based on their intensity and the m/z
range of 250-300.

or NCBI GenBank. GISAID accession number or the GenBank accession id from which

plasmids was co-transfected into HEK293T cells along with full-length or mutant SARS-

CoV-2 spike plasmids using Lipofectamine 2000 to produce a single round of infection
competent pseudo-viruses. The medium was changed 12 hours after transfection.
Supernatants containing the viruses were harvested 48h after transfection. In sterile 96well half-area plates, 25 μl of virus was immediately added to 10,000 HeLa or HeLa-ACE2
cells in 75 μl of medium. Plates were incubated at 37°C for 42 to 48 h. Following the
infection, HeLa and HeLa-hACE2 cells were lysed using 1x luciferase lysis buffer (25 mM
Gly-Gly pH 7.8, 15 mM MgSO4, 4 mM EGTA, 1% Triton X-100). Luciferase intensity was
then read on a Luminometer with luciferase substrate according to the manufacturer’s
instructions (Promega, PR-E2620).
Site-specific glycosylation
A sample of the SARS-CoV-2 prefusion spike protein expressed in the SF9 insect cell
line was prepared for MS analysis as previously described with minor modifications (24).
In brief, the protein (50 µg) was denatured and aliquots (10 µg) were digested under five
different protease conditions including chymotrypsin, a combination of trypsin and
chymotrypsin, trypsin, elastase and subtilisin as described. All samples were then pooled
and deglycosylated by Endo H followed by PNGase F in O 18-water. To obtain full site
coverage, an additional aliquot of the denatured protein (10 µg) sample was digested with
chymotrypsin (1:13 w/w) only and deglycosylated with EndoH and PNGase F like the
other samples.
The combined protease-treated and chymotrypsin only samples were separately
analyzed on an Q Exactive HF-X mass spectrometer (Thermo). Each sample was run
twice as replicate. Samples were injected directly onto a 25 cm, 100 μm ID column packed

with BEH 1.7 μm C18 resin (Waters). Samples were separated at a flow rate of 300 nL/min
on a nLC 1200 (Thermo). Solutions A and B were 0.1% formic acid in 5% and 80%
acetonitrile, respectively. A gradient of 1–25% B over 160 min, an increase to 40% B over
40 min, an increase to 90% B over another 10 min and held at 90% B for 30 min was
used for a 240 min total run time. Column was re-equilibrated with solution A prior to the
injection of sample. Peptides were eluted directly from the tip of the column and
nanosprayed directly into the mass spectrometer by application of 2.8 kV voltage at the
back of the column. The HFX was operated in a data dependent mode. Full MS1 scans
were collected in the Orbitrap at 120k resolution. The ten most abundant ions per scan
were selected for HCD MS/MS at 25NCE. Dynamic exclusion was enabled with exclusion
duration of 10 s and singly charged ions were excluded.
The MS data were processed essentially as described previously (24). The data were
searched against the proteome database and quantified using peak area in Integrated
Proteomics Pipeline-IP2. Since the processing pathway in SF9 cell line (insect cell line)
is similar to mammalian cells for oligomannose and hybrid structures cleaved by Endo-H,
and then diverges to produce a combination of paucimannose and complex type glycans,
peptides with N+203 were identified as having oligomannose type glycans, and peptides
with N+3 are assigned as peptides with complex and paucimannose type glycans.
