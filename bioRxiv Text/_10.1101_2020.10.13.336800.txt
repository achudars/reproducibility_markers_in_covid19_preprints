Abstract
Neutralizing monoclonal antibodies (nAbs) to severe acute respiratory syndrome
coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) represent promising candidates for clinical
intervention against coronavirus virus diseases 2019 (COVID-19). We isolated a
large number of nAbs from SARS-CoV-2 infected individuals capable of
disrupting proper interaction between the receptor binding domain (RBD) of the
viral spike (S) protein and the receptor angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE2).
In order to understand the mechanism of these nAbs on neutralizing SARS-CoV2 virus infections, we have performed cryo-EM analysis and here report cryo-EM
structures of the ten most potent nAbs in their native full-length IgG or Fab forms
bound to the trimeric S protein of SARS-CoV-2. The bivalent binding of the fulllength IgG is found to associate with more RBD in the “up” conformation than the
monovalent binding of Fab, perhaps contributing to the enhanced neutralizing
activity of IgG and triggering more shedding of the S1 subunit from the S protein.
Comparison of large number of nAbs identified common and unique structural
features associated with their potent neutralizing activities. This work provides
structural basis for further understanding the mechanism of nAbs, especially
through revealing the bivalent binding and their correlation with more potent
neutralization and the shedding of S1 subunit.

Introduction
The global pandemic of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) caused by the severe
acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is a serious threat to human
health(1, 2). SARS-CoV-2 is an enveloped, positive-strand RNA virus, belonging to the
beta-coronavirus genus that also includes SARS-CoV (3) and the Middle Eastern
respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) (4) that caused epidemic in 2003 and
2012, respectively. SARS-CoV-2 shares about 80% sequence identity with SARS-CoV,
both use angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) as their cellular receptor (5-9) that
is recognized and bound by the trimeric spike (S) protein (10, 11)that distributes on the
surface of the virion particles (12-14) and is proteolytically cleaved into N-terminal S1
subunit and C-terminal S2 subunit during viral entry into target cells(15). S1 contains
the N-terminal domain (NTD), the receptor binding domain (RBD), the subdomain 1
and 2 and is responsible for binding to receptor. S2 mediates the fusion of the viral and
cellular membrane by undergoing a dramatic conformation change from the prefusion
to the postfusion state (16) accompanying with the shedding of S1. RBD, which directly
binds to ACE2 receptor, is a major target for development of the therapeutic
neutralizing monoclonal antibodies (nAbs) against COVID-19. The prefusion structure
of S protein exhibits more dynamic conformational changes in S1 region, especially in
RBD, which has two distinctive conformations: “up” and ‘‘down’’(10, 11). Only the
“up” conformation of RBD can bind to the ACE2 receptor. Up to now, numerous nAbs
against the S protein of SARS-CoV-2 have been reported (17-23). The complex
structures of these nAbs with S protein were solved, most of which utilized the Fab
form of nAbs. It remains largely unknown how nAbs in their native bivalent form bind
to and ever induce the conformation changes of the trimeric S protein.

To further explore the interactions between nAbs and S proteins, we solved ten cryo
electron microscopy (cryo-EM) structures of the S protein in complex with nAbs, in
full-length form and/or in Fab form. Bivalent binding was revealed for the full-length
form nAbs, which showed that the full-length form exhibits different binding mode and
induces more RBDs to the “up” conformation than the Fab form that is monovalent. It

is also shown that the bivalent binding is superior in antiviral efficacy, and correlated
with the improved shedding of S1 subunit. Structural comparison of large number of
the complexes of nAbs with S protein identified common and unique features
associated with the potent neutralizing activities of these nAbs. Our results provide an
important structural basis for further understanding the working mechanism of nAbs
and are helpful for antiviral drug design and vaccine development.

Potent nAbs isolated from the COVID-19 convalescent patients
To understand the molecular features of the interactions of neutralizing nAbs with S
protein, we characterized ten nAbs derived from various COVID-19 convalescents
about the binding and neutralizing activities, and the capacity of competing with ACE2
for RBD binding. The binding affinity to RBD of SARS-CoV-2 of these nAbs measured
by surface plasmon resonance varied from 0.75 to 90.09 nM (Fig. S1A and Table 1),
whereas the half maximal inhibitory concentration (IC50) of these nAbs ranged from
0.0014 to 0.9231 μg/ml in the pseudo virus based assay or from 0.0043 to 0.8932 µg/ml
in live SARS-CoV-2 virus based assay, respectively (Ref, Table 1 and Fig. S1). All of
these nAbs exhibited strong competition with ACE2 to bind RBD, indicating their
neutralization mechanism (Table 1 and Fig. S1). The variable regions of the heavy chain
of these nAbs belong to diverse gene families, paired with different families of light
chains. The CDR3 length of the heavy chains and the light chains ranged from 9 to 22
amino acids and from 9 to 11 amino acids, respectively (Table S1). The somatic
hypermutation (SHM) of these nAbs were generally low and five of them reached 0%
for heavy chain or light chain.

Inducing shedding of the surface proteins of viruses is an important feature for nAbs.
So, we decided to examine whether the nAbs in this work can induce the shedding of
the S1 subunit of the S protein of SARS-CoV-2 or not by transfecting plasmids
encoding SARS-CoV-2 S protein into HEK293T cells. The results showed that some
nAbs, such as P5A-2G9, could notably induce shedding of the S protein, whereas some

nAbs, such as P5A-1B9 and P5A-3C12, had only a weak shedding ability and P2B1A1 exhibited almost no shedding ability, suggesting the diversity of these nAbs in
terms of inducing the shedding of S1 subunit.

The complex structures of the SARS-CoV-2 S trimer bound with nAbs
To get deeper understanding of the working mechanism, we determined the complex
structures of the full-length IgG form of these nAbs with the S protein of SARS-CoV2 using single particle cryo-EM at overall resolution from 2.8 angstroms to 3.6
angstroms (Fig. 1, Fig. S2-6 and Table S2). The nAbs were incubated with the S protein
at excessive molar ratio and the unbound nAbs were removed by gel filtration (Fig. S2).
Focused refinement at the interface between nAbs and RBD of the S protein notably
improved the map quality, allowing detailed analysis. Additionally, we also prepared
the cryo-EM samples of the S protein incubated with Fab region of P5A-3A1, P5A3C12 in a short period of time. For the Fab-bound complexes, only the structures with
lower resolution at the interface of Fab and RBD were obtained (Fig. 1, Fig. S7-8). For
clarity, we use IgG and Fab to indicate the bivalent full-length form and the monovalent
Fab form of nAbs, respectively. If there is no such specific label, it means the bivalent
full-length form of nAb.

The structures of these S-IgG complexes can be classified into three different binding
patterns (Fig. 1). In pattern 1 that includes P2B-1A10, P2B-1A1, P5A-2G7 and P5A2G9, two “up” RBDs are bound with nAb. In pattern 2 that contains P5A-2F11, P5A1B8 and P5A-1B6, two or three RBDs are in “up” conformation and bound with nAb.
P5A-1B9, the most potent nAb in this work, itself constitutes the pattern 3 that contains
one “up” RBD and two “down” RBD. All of three RBDs in P5A-1B9 are bound with
nAb and share the same binding interface (Fig. S9).

The bivalent binding of nAbs
It’s reported that the bivalent binding of antibodies can neutralize the virus more

efficiently than Fabs in some viruses such as rhinovirus and Dengue virus (24, 25). To
examine the structural difference of the complexes of the S protein with IgG and with
Fab, we further solved the complex structures of the S protein with Fab region of P5A1B8 or P5A-2G7 (Fig. 2, Fig. S8). In the S/P5A-1B8(IgG) complex, two or three RBDs
are in “up” conformation and bound with nAb (Fig. 1), whereas only two RBDs are in
“up” conformation and bound with nAb in the S/P5A-1B8(Fab) complex. Next we
choose the S/P5A-1B8(IgG) complex containing two “up” RBDs to compare with the
S/P5A-1B8(Fab) complex. The structural comparison showed that the two cryo-EM
densities corresponding to the nAb in the S/P5A-1B8(IgG) complex are closer to each
other than that in the S/P5A-1B8(Fab) complex (Fig. 2A). When one of the Fab regions
of the S/P5A-1B8(IgG) complex is superimposed with that of the S/P5A-1B8(Fab)
complex, the other Fab exhibits different orientation (Fig. 2A). For P5A-2G7, only one
Fab binds to one “up” RBD in the S/P5A-2G7(Fab) complex, whereas two “up” RBDs
are bound with nAb in the S/P5A-2G7(IgG) complex, indicating a different binding
pattern between the IgG form and the Fab form (Fig. 2B).

We also re-centered the particles of the S/P5A-1B8(IgG) complex and the S/P5A1B8(Fab) complex at the Fab region and calculated the two-dimensional (2D)
classification. The 2D class averages showed extra density near nAb of the S/P5A1B8(IgG) complex, which might correspond to the Fc region of the P5A-1B8 (Fig. 2C)
and was absent in the 2D class averages of the S/P5A-1B8(Fab) complex (Fig. 2D).
Additionally, the Fab regions of an intact antibody molecule can be docked into the
cryo-EM map of the S/P5A-1B8(IgG) complex (Fig. 2E). Taken together, these results
support the bivalent binding exists for both P5A-1B8 and P5A-2G7.

IgG-form nAbs shows advantage over Fab-form ones in neutralizing potency and
shedding of S1 subunit
To investigate the working mechanism more deeply, we compared the neutralizing
potency and the ability to induce the shedding of S1 between the IgG form and the Fab
form of the nAbs. As shown in Fig. 3A, the IgG form nAbs exhibited higher

neutralizing potency than the Fab-form of the same nAbs. The neutralizing IC50 values
of the IgG-form were decreased for 700-fold compared to the Fab form for P5A-1B8
and P5A-1B9, whereas P5A-2G7 exhibited even greater decreasing of more than 3,000
folds. To investigate the ability of inducing the shedding of S1 subunit for these nAbs
in IgG- or Fab-forms, we incubated S protein-surface-expressed cells with IgG or Fab
at saturated concentration and measured their binding over time by flow cytometry. As
shown in Fig. 3B, the IgG of P5A-1B8 triggered S1 shedding most potently, which
induced the shedding of S1 subunit for about 80% of the S protein after incubating with
cells for 120 minutes. However, the Fab-form of P5A-1B8 nearly completely lost the
ability of inducing the shedding of S1. P5A-1B9 and P5A-2G7 showed mild shedding
ability. As a control and consistent with the expectation, S1 of the GSAS-containing
mutant cannot be shed by either IgG or Fab (Fig. 3C). The rest nAbs tested also exhibit
similar properties (Fig. S10).

Comparisons of antibody binding epitopes
A summary of the above cryo-EM structure determinations enabled us to compare and
classify the epitopes of these antibodies (Fig. 4 and Fig. S11). In the final models, the
Fab was successfully built for antibodies P2B-1A10, P5A-1B8, P5A-2G9, P5A-1B6,
P2B-1A1, P5A-2G7, P5A-1B9 and P5A-2F11, and scFv was built for antibodies P5A3A1 and P5A-3C12 due to the weak densities in the CH1 domains. These ten
neutralizing antibodies all target the receptor binding motif (RBM) of RBD and could
be classified into three groups, considering the epitopes and approaching angles to the
RBD. The first group, including P2B-1A10, P5A-3A1, P5A-1B8, P5A-2G9, P5A-1B6,
P2B-1A1 and P5A-2G7, has the largest overlap between the epitope and RBM. Their
epitope residues are distributed across the RBM, mainly in the cradle region. Among
the 17 residues of RBD involved in receptor binding, more than half (8 to 15) were
recognized by the antibodies in the group 1. The antibodies in group 1 also have similar
contacting angles with the RBD ranging from 39 to 52 degrees, and can be further
divided into three subgroups. The subgroup 1 consists of three antibodies P2B-1A10,
P5A-3A1 and P5A-1B8, which use the same heavy chain IGHV3-53 V gene and exhibit

very similar positional arrangement. They are all antibodies whose heavy chain plays a
leading role. Among the 17 residues of RBD involved in receptor binding, 8 to 9 were
recognized by the heavy chains in the subgroup1 while the number is 2 to 5 by light
chains. The shedding activity is higher than 77.2%. When RBD of the structures in first
subgroup was aligned, the distances of VH domains or VL domains are ranging from
1.8 to 2.3 angstroms or from 2.4 to 3.3 angstroms, respectively. The usage of the
IGHV3-53/ IGHV3-66 V genes have also been reported for other antibodies such as
B38 and CB6 (23, 26).

The subgroup 2 contains P5A-2G9 and P5A-1B6 and uses heavy chain gene from
IGHV 3 family, but not IGHV3-53 gene. The subgroup 2 has a different VH and VL
positional arrangement from the subgroup 1. The subgroup 3 contains P2B-1A1 and
P5A-2G7, which use heavy chain gene from IGHV4 family and have a rotation around
the longitudinal axis of the Fab compared with the antibodies in subgroup 1 and 2. The
heavy chain of P5A-2G7 plays the leading role like subgroup1 and subgroup2
antibodies while the light chain of P2B-1A1 plays the leading role.

The P5A-1B9 alone forms the group 2 among the eight neutralizing antibodies we have
structurally characterized. The inter-molecular angle between P5A-1B9 and the RBD
is 52 degrees anti-clockwise while the ACE2 degree is clockwise. Upon binding, P5A1B9 approaches the RBD from a direction different from those of the first group
antibodies. The epitope for P5A-1B9 has 6 residues overlapping with RBM. The heavy
chain contributes 6 residues and the light chain contribute 2 residues. The shedding
ability is 43.8%. The group 3 consists of antibodies P5A-2F11 and P5A-3C12, which
use heavy chain genes from IGHV1 and IGHV2 family, respectively. The epitopes for
antibodies in group 3 are mainly located in the remote loops and less overlapped with
RBM, with only 6 or 4 overlapping residues for P5A-2F11 or P5A-3C12, respectively.
The heavy chain of P5A-2F11 plays the leading role while the light chain of P5A-3C12
plays the leading role. The shedding ability is higher than 54.5%.

Discussion
In this work, we solved ten complex structures of the S protein with nAbs in full-length
IgG form and/or in Fab form. Structural analysis revealed the bivalent binding mode of
nAbs against SARS-CoV-2. Our biochemical and cell-based experimental results
showed that the full-length IgG nAbs have greater binding ability, neutralization ability,
and induce more S1 shedding than Fab. Similar results were also obtained in other
study(27). Moreover, there are more RBDs in ‘‘up’’ conformation in the structures of
the S protein in complex with full-length IgG than that in complex with Fab. The
difference should be attributed to the bivalent binding of IgG molecules that contain
two Fab molecules. The full-length IgG nAbs bind to SARC-CoV-2 S proteins in
bivalent mode with higher probability than the Fabs thus may induce stronger
neutralization. Furthermore, the cooperation of the RBD conformational change
induced by the bivalent binding would enhance the induced-conformational change of
the S proteins on a virus surface. More importantly, the presence of Fc region in the
antibody-virus complex can enhance the immunity response by the Fc receptors of T
cells. Up to now, numerous complex structures of the S protein with nAb have been
reported, most of which used nAb in Fab-form, especially those solved with X-ray
crystallography. Our results suggest that the full-length IgG-form, which is more
biologically relevant than Fab, should be used for the structural determination as much
as possible to understand the structural and functional features of nAbs.

Among the ten nAbs reported in this research, the subgroup 1 and 2 of group 1 have a
higher shedding ability (above 76 %), while the subgroup 3 of group 1, group 2 and
group 3 show no or a weaker shedding ability (43.8% - 57.2%). The group 1 has the
largest overlap between the epitope and RBM, while the members in subgroup 3 have
a rotation around the longitudinal axis of the Fab. The S1 shedding ability of the nAbs
may be facilitated by the large overlap with RBM and require special angle to bind with
RBD.

The SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 cross-reactive antibodies that show neutralizing

activity mainly target to RBD, interfere with ACE2 binding and stimulate S1
dissociation (28), suggesting the ability to induce the shedding of S1 is correlated with
the potency of the neutralizing nAbs. The shedding of S1 might be facilitated by the
RBD in up conformation that is stabilized by the binding of nAb or receptor. It is not
clear whether the shedding of all of three S1 subunits is required for the transition from
the prefusion state to the postfusion state to catalyze the fusion of viral and cellular
membrane or not. Our previous work indicates the receptor ACE2 exists as a dimer.
Each protomer of ACE2 dimer can be bound with one RBD from a S protein trimer and
induces the bound RBD to the “up” conformation. It seems unlikely that one ACE2
dimer binds to a trimeric S protein simultaneously because of the steric clash. To induce
more than one RBDs in a S protein to up conformation, multiple copies of ACE2 are
required.

Up to now, there are 17 structures involving anti-SARS-CoV-2 nAbs in the Protein Data
Bank (PDB) database. The group 1 nAbs, which have the largest overlap between the
epitope and RBM, not only are most popular in this work, but have many similar nAbs
in the PDB database, including B38 (PDB code: 7BZ5)(26), CB6 (PDB code:
7C01)(23), C105 (PDB code: 6XCN)(29), CV30 (PDB code: 6XE1)(30), CC12.1 (PDB
code: 6XC2)(31), CC12.3 (PDB code: 6XC4)(31), COVA2-04 (PDB code: 7JMO)(32)
and COVA2-39 (PDB code: 7JMP)(32). Interestingly, the P2B-1A10, P5A-3A1, P5A1B8, B38, C105, CV30, CC12.1, CC12.3, COVA2-04 and COVA2-39 are all belong to
the IGHV3-53 gene family. The group 2 nAb P5A-1B9 has the highest inhibitory
activities against the cell infection of both pseudo and live SARS-CoV-2. Structure of
the complex of P5A-1B9 with S protein shows that it can bind to RBD in both up and
down conformation, similar to the nAb BD-368-2 reported by other group (33),
suggesting a common mechanism behind these nAbs of very high potency. The epitope
of P5A-1B9 is only 6-residue overlapped with RBM, and is similar to P2B-2F6 (PDB
code: 7BWJ)(17), Fab2-4 (PDB code: 6XEY)(34) and BD23 (PDB code: 7BYR)(35),
but they have different gene family. P2B-2F6 and Fab2-4 have different approaching
direction between the nAbs and RBD to the group 1 nAbs. The group 3 nAbs, P5A-

Table 1 | Binding capacity, neutralizing activity, and gene family analysis of
COVID-19 donor-derived neutralizing nAbs.
* Published in the reference (Zhang, et al. Public neutralizing antibodies elicited by
SARS-CoV-2 infection. submitted). The program IMGT/V-QUEST was applied to
analyze gene germline, complementarity determining region (CDR) 3 length, and
somatic hypermutation (SHM). The CDR3 length was calculated from amino acids
sequences. The SHM frequency was calculated from the mutated nucleotides. Antibody
binding to RBD was presented either by Kd or by competing with ACE2 where “+++”
indicates >80% competition. IC50 represents the half-maximal whereas IC80 the 80%
inhibitory concentrations in the pseudovirus and live SARS-CoV-2 neutralization assay.

Fig. 1 | All solved structures of nAbs in complex with S protein.
The domain-colored models of the all complex are shown here. The structures
containing different number of the same nAb are boxed with blue dash line. The
structures are labelled according to the number of RBD bound with nAb as mono (1
RBD), double (2 RBDs) or triple (3 RBDs) binding, respectively.

cryo-EM map of the S/P5A-1B8(IgG) complex can be docked with the Fc region of a
full-length antibody model. The Fc, heavy chain, and light chain of the antibody are
colored in gold, blue and cyan, respectively.

A, Neutralizing activity against SARS-CoV-2 pseudovirus by P5A-1B8, P5A-1B9, and
P5A-2G7 in IgG forms (solid line) and Fab forms (dotted line). B is the shedding of S1
over time measured using flow cytometry at 37°C with 293T cell-surface expressed
wild type SARS-Cov-2 S protein. C is same to B, with a mutant S protein containing
GSAS substitution at S1/S2 cleavage motif. Data shown were from at least two
independent experiments.

Fig. 4 | The epitopes of 10 anti SARS-CoV-2 RBD nAbs. The 10 antibodies could be
classified into three groups. The first group antibodies can be further divided into three
subgroups. The complexes of RBD with ACE2 or nAbs are shown as cartoon with RBD
colored in wheat, the light chains of nAbs colored in cyan and the heavy chains of nAbs
colored in different colors. RBD is also shown as grey surface in top, front and back
views, with the RBM colored in cyan and the epitopes of different nAbs shown in
respective colors. For the top views, the epitopes corresponding to heavy chains and
lights chains are shown separately in respective colors for heavy chains or in cyan for
light chains.
