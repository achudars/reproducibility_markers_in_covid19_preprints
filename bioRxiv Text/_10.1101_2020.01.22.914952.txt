23

Since the SARS outbreak 18 years ago, a large number of severe acute

24

respiratory syndrome related coronaviruses (SARSr-CoV) have been discovered

25

in their natural reservoir host, bats1-4. Previous studies indicated that some of

26

those bat SARSr-CoVs have the potential to infect humans5-7. Here we report the

27

identification and characterization of a novel coronavirus (nCoV-2019) which

28

caused an epidemic of acute respiratory syndrome in humans, in Wuhan, China.

29

The epidemic, started from December 12th, 2019, has caused 198 laboratory

30

confirmed infections with three fatal cases by January 20th, 2020. Full-length

31

genome sequences were obtained from five patients at the early stage of the

32

outbreak. They are almost identical to each other and share 79.5% sequence

33

identify to SARS-CoV. Furthermore, it was found that nCoV-2019 is 96%

34

identical at the whole genome level to a bat coronavirus. The pairwise protein

35

sequence analysis of seven conserved non-structural proteins show that this virus

36

belongs to the species of SARSr-CoV. The nCoV-2019 virus was then isolated

37

from the bronchoalveolar lavage fluid of a critically ill patient, which can be

38

neutralized by sera from several patients. Importantly, we have confirmed that

39

this novel CoV uses the same cell entry receptor, ACE2, as SARS-CoV.

40
41

Coronavirus has caused two large-scale pandemic in the last two decades, SARS and

42

MERS (Middle East respiratory syndrome)8,9. It was generally believed that SARSr-

43

CoV, mainly found in bats, might cause future disease outbreak10,11. Here we report

44

on a series of unidentified pneumonia disease outbreaks in Wuhan, Hubei province,

45

central China (Extended Data Figure 1). Started from a local fresh seafood market, the

46

epidemic has resulted in 198 laboratory confirmed cases with three death according to

47

authorities so far12. Typical clinical symptoms of these patients are fever, dry cough,

48

dyspnea, headache, and pneumonia. Disease onset may result in progressive

49

respiratory failure due to alveolar damage and even death. The disease was

50

determined as viral induced pneumonia by clinicians according to clinical symptoms

51

and other criteria including body temperature rising, lymphocytes and white blood

52

cells decreasing (sometimes normal for the later), new pulmonary infiltrates on chest

53

radiography, and no obvious improvement upon three days antibiotics treatment. It

54

appears most of the early cases had contact history with the original seafood market,

55

and no large scale of human-to-human transmission was observed so far.

56
57

Samples from seven patients with severe pneumonia (six are seafood market peddlers

58

or delivers), who were enrolled in intensive unit cares at the beginning of the outbreak,

59

were sent to WIV laboratory for pathogen diagnosis (Extended Data Table 1). As a

60

CoV lab, we first used pan-CoV PCR primers to test these samples13, considering the

61

outbreak happened in winter and in a market, same environment as SARS. We found

62

five PCR positive. A sample (WIV04) collected from bronchoalveolar lavage fluid

63

(BALF) was analysed by metagenomics analysis using next-generation sequencing

64

(NGS) to identify potential etiological agents. Of the 1582 total reads obtained after

65

human genome filtering, 1378 (87.1%) matched sequences of SARSr-CoV (Fig. 1a).

66

By de novo assembly and targeted PCR, we obtained a 29,891-bp CoV genome that

67

shared 79.5% sequence identity to SARS-CoV BJ01 (GenBank accession number

68

AY278488.2). This sequence has been submitted to GISAID (accession no.

69

EPI_ISL_402124). Following the name by WHO, we tentatively call it novel

70

coronavirus 2019 (nCoV-2019). Four more full-length genome sequences of nCoV-

71

2019 (WIV02, WIV05, WIV06, and WIV07) (GISAID accession nos.

72

EPI_ISL_402127-402130) that were above 99.9% identical to each other were

73

subsequently obtained from other four patients (Extended Data Table 2).

74
75

The virus genome consists of six major open reading frames (ORFs) common to

76

coronaviruses and a number of other accessory genes (Fig. 1b). Further analysis

77

indicates that some of the nCoV-2019 genes shared less than 80% nt sequence

78

identity to SARS-CoV. However, the seven conserved replicase domains in ORF1ab

79

that were used for CoV species classification, are 94.6% aa sequence identical

80

between nCoV-2019 and SARS-CoV, implying the two belong to same species

81

(Extended Data Table 3).

82
83

We then found a short RdRp region from a bat coronavirus termed BatCoV RaTG13

84

which we previously detected in Rhinolophus affinis from Yunnan Province showed

85

high sequence identity to nCoV-2019. We did full-length sequencing to this RNA

86

sample. Simplot analysis showed that nCoV-2019 was highly similar throughout the

87

genome to RaTG13 (Fig. 1c), with 96.2% overall genome sequence identity. The

88

phylogenetic analysis also showed that RaTG13 is the closest relative of the nCoV-

89

2019 and form a distinct lineage from other SARSr-CoVs (Fig. 1d). The receptor

90

binding protein spike (S) gene was highly divergent to other CoVs (Extended Data

91

Figure 2), with less than 75% nt sequence identity to all previously described SARSr-

92

CoVs except a 93.1% nt identity to RaTG13 (Extended Data Table 3). The S genes of

93

nCoV-2019 and RaTG13 S gene are longer than other SARSr-CoVs. The major

94

differences in nCoV-2019 are the three short insertions in the N-terminal domain, and

95

four out of five key residues changes in the receptor-binding motif, in comparison

96

with SARS-CoV (Extended Data Figure 3). The close phylogenetic relationship to

97

RaTG13 provides evidence for a bat origin of nCoV-2019.

98
99

We rapidly developed a qPCR detection based on the receptor-binding domain of

100

spike gene, the most variable region among genome (Fig. 1c). Our data show the

101

primers could differentiate nCoV-2019 with all other human coronaviruses including

102

bat SARSr-CoV WIV1, which is 95% identity to SARS-CoV (Extended Data Figure

103

4a and 4b). From the seven patients, we found nCoV-2019 positive in six BALF and

104

five oral swab samples during the first sampling by qPCR and conventional PCR

105

(Extended Data Figure 4c). However, we can no longer find viral positive in oral

106

swabs, anal swabs, and blood from these patients during the second sampling (Fig.

107

2a). Based on these findings, we conclude that the disease should be transmitted

108

through airway, yet we can’t rule out other possibilities if the investigation extended

109

to include more patients.

110
111

For serological detection of nCoV-2019, we used previously developed bat SARSr-

112

CoV Rp3 nucleocapsid protein (NP) as antigen in IgG and IgM ELISA test, which

113

showed no cross-reactivity against other human coronaviruses except SARSr-CoV7.

114

As a research lab, we were only able to get five serum samples from the seven viral

115

infected patients. We monitored viral antibody levels in one patient (ICU-06) at seven,

116

eight, nine, and eighteen days after disease onset (Extended Data Table 2). A clear

117

trend of IgG and IgM titre (decreased at the last day) increase was observed (Fig. 2b).

118

For a second investigation, we tested viral antibody for five of the seven viral positive

119

patients around twenty days after disease onset (Extended Data Table 1 and 2). All

bioRxiv preprint doi: https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.01.22.914952; this version posted January 23, 2020. The copyright holder for this

120

patient samples, but not samples from healthy people, showed strong viral IgG

121

positive (Fig. 2b). We also found three IgM positive, indicating acute infection.

122
123

We then successfully isolated the virus (named nCoV-2019

124

BetaCoV/Wuhan/WIV04/2019), in Vero and Huh7 cells using BALF sample from

125

ICU-06 patient. Clear cytopathogenic effects were observed in cells after three days

126

incubation (Extended Data Figure 5a and 5b). The identity of the strain WIV04 was

127

verified in Vero E6 cells by immunofluorescence microscopy using cross-reactive

128

viral NP antibody (Extended Data Figure 5c and 5d), and by metagenomic sequencing,

129

from which most of the reads mapped to nCoV-2019 (Extended Data Figure 5e and

130

5f). Viral partials in ultrathin sections of infected cells displayed typical coronavirus

131

morphology under electron microscopy (Fig. 3). To further confirm the neutralization

132

activity of the viral IgG positive samples, we conducted serum-neutralization assays

133

in Vero E6 cells using the five IgG positive patient sera. We demonstrate that all

134

samples were able to neutralize 120 TCID50 nCoV-2019 at a dilution of 1:40-1:80.

135

We also show that this virus could be cross-neutralized by horse anti-SARS-CoV

136

serum at dilutions 1:80, further confirming the relationship of the two viruses

137

(Extended Data Table 4).

138
139

Angiotensin converting enzyme II (ACE2) was known as cell receptor for SARS-

140

CoV14. To determine whether nCoV-2019 also use ACE2 as a cellular entry receptor,

141

we conducted virus infectivity studies using HeLa cells expressing or not expressing

142

ACE2 proteins from humans, Chinese horseshoe bats, civet, pig, and mouse. We

143

show that nCoV-2019 is able to use all but mouse ACE2 as an entry receptor in the

144

ACE2-expressing cells, but not cells without ACE2, indicating which is likely the cell

145

receptor of nCoV-2019 (Fig. 4). We also proved that nCoV-2019 does not use other

146

coronavirus receptors, aminopeptidase N and dipeptidyl peptidase 4 (Extended Data

147

Figure 6).

148
149

The study provides the first detailed report on nCoV-2019, the likely etiology agent

150

responsible for ongoing acute respiratory syndrome epidemic in Wuhan, central China.

151

Viral specific nucleotide positive and viral protein seroconversion observed in all

152

patients tested provides evidence of an association between the disease and the

153

presence of this virus. However, there are still many urgent questions to be answered.

154

We need more clinical data and samples to confirm if this virus is indeed the etiology

155

agent for this epidemic. In addition, we still don’t know if this virus continue evolving

156

and become more transmissible between human-to-human. Moreover, we don’t know

157

the transmission routine of this virus among hosts yet. We showed viral positive in

158

oral swabs, implying nCoV-2019 may be transmitted through airway. However, this

159

needs to be confirmed by extending detection range. Finally, based on our results, it

160

should be expected and worth to test if ACE2 targeting or SARS-CoV targeting drugs

161

can be used for nCoV-2019 patients. At this stage, we know very little about the virus,

162

including basic biology, animal source or any specific treatment. The almost identical

163

sequences of this virus in different patients imply a probably recent introduction in

164

humans, thus future surveillance on viral mutation and transmission ability and

165

further global research attention are urgently needed.

Sample collection. Human samples, including oral swabs, anal swabs, blood, and

275

BALF samples were collected by Jinyintan hospital (Wuhan) with the consent from

276

all patients. Patients were sampled without gender or age preference unless where

and next-generation sequencing using Illumina MiSeq 3000 sequencer. Metagenomic

374

analysis was carried out mainly base on the bioinformatics platform MGmapper

375

(PE_2.24 and SE_2.24). The raw NGS reads were firstly processed by Cutadapt

376

(v1.18) with minimum read length of 30bp. BWA (v0.7.12-r1039) was utilized to

377

align reads to local database with a filter hits parameter at 0.8 FMM value and

378

minimum alignment score at 30. Parameters for post-processing of assigned reads was

379

set with minimum size normalized abundance at 0.01, minimum read count at 20 and

380

other default parameters. A local nucleic acid database for human and mammals was

381

employed to filter reads of host genomes before mapping reads to virus database. The

382

results of metagenomic analysis were displayed through pie charts using WPS Office

383

2010. NGS reads were assembled into genomes using Geneious (v11.0.3) and

384

MEGAHIT (v1.2.9). PCR and Sanger sequencing was performed to fill gaps in the

385

genome. 5’-RACE was performed to determine the 5’-end of the genomes using

386

SMARTer RACE 5’/3’ Kit (Takara). Genomes were annotated using Clone Manager

387

Professional Suite 8 (Sci-Ed Software).
