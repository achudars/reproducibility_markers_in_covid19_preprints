ABSTRACT
Statistical and epidemiological data imply temperature sensitivity of the SARS-CoV-2
coronavirus. However, the molecular level understanding of the virus structure at different
temperature is still not clear. Spike protein is the outermost structural protein of the SARS-CoV2 virus which interacts with the Angiotensin Converting Enzyme 2 (ACE2), a human receptor,
and enters the respiratory system. In this study, we performed an all atom molecular dynamics
simulation to study the effect of temperature on the structure of the Spike protein. After 200ns of
simulation at different temperatures, we came across some interesting phenomena exhibited by
the protein. We found that the solvent exposed domain of Spike protein, namely S1, is more
mobile than the transmembrane domain, S2. Structural studies implied the presence of several
charged residues on the surface of N-terminal Domain of S1 which are optimally oriented at 10C. Bioinformatics analyses indicated that it is capable of binding to other human receptors
and should not be disregarded. Additionally, we found that receptor binding motif (RBM),
present on the receptor binding domain (RBD) of S1, begins to close around temperature of 40 C
and attains a completely closed conformation at 50 C. The closed conformation disables its
ability to bind to ACE2, due to the burying of its receptor binding residues. Our results clearly
show that there are active and inactive states of the protein at different temperatures. This would
not only prove beneficial for understanding the fundamental nature of the virus, but would be
also useful in the development of vaccines and therapeutics.

INTRODUCTION

Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 or SARS-COV-2, attacks the cells of the
human respiratory system. Recent studies have found that the virus also interacts with the cells of
the digestive system, renal system, liver, pancreas, eyes and brain [1]. It is known to cause severe
sickness and is fatal in many cases [2]. It is believed that the virus originated in bats, which act
as the natural reservoir; subsequently it got transmitted to human. It then gradually spread across
almost all the nations through aerial transmission resulting in one of the worst known global
pandemic of this century [3].

SARS-COV-2 is one of the seven forms of coronaviruses that affect the human population. The
other known coronaviruses include HCoV-229E, HCoV-OC43, SARS-CoV, HCoV-NL63,
HCoV-HKU1 and MERS-CoV [4,5]. Their infection varies from common cold to SARS, MERS
or Covid19 [5]. These viruses have been observed to affect the human population predominantly
during a particular season. For instance, the 2002 SARS infections began during the cold winters
of November and after eight months, the number of reported cases became almost negligible [5].
Statistics show that countries with hot and humid weather conditions had lesser number of
infectious cases of SARS [6]. However, MERS-COV, which was identified in Middle East
regions, affected individuals during the summer [5]. Thus, the disease epidemiology suggests
that the virus is found to be prominent in certain climatic conditions only.

The viability of SARS-COV-2 was measured on different surfaces y

[7]. Smooth surfaces, plastics and iron show greater viability of the virus compared to that of
paper, tissue, wood or cloth. Surgical masks had detectable viruses even on 7th day [8, 9]. Soaps
and disinfectants which disintegrate the virus membrane and structural proteins are a potent
example of how the modulation of atmospheric conditions can affect the virus viability.
Statistical reports by Cai et. al., and several others had shown that tropical countries like
Malaysia, Indonesia or Thailand with high temperature and high relative humidity did not have
major community outbreaks of SARS [6, 10-11]. Although viruses cannot be killed like bacteria
by autoclaving, temperature sensitivity of virus have been reported several times in the past.

Similarly, the viability of SARS virus that persisted for 5 days at temperatures ranging etween

When the virus is exposed to different temperature conditions, the initial interactions of the
atmosphere occur with the structural proteins. There are four major structural proteins present on
the virus, the Spike glycoprotein, the Envelope protein, the Membrane protein and the
Nucleocapsid. Each of the proteins performs specific functions in receptor binding, viral
assembly and genome release [16]. One of the first and largest structural proteins of the
Coronavirus is the Spike glycoprotein [17]. The protein exists as a homotrimer where each
monomer consists of 1273 amino acid residues (Figure 1) and is intertwined with each other.
Each monomer has two domains, namely S1 and S2 [18]. The S1 and S2 domains are cleaved at

a furin site by a host cell protease [18, 19]. The S1 domain lies predominantly above the lipid
bilayer. The S2 domain, which is a class I transmembrane domain, travels across the bilayer and
ends towards the inner side of the lipid membrane [18]. Figure 1 shows the two domains of the
Spike glycoprotein.

The S1 domain comprises of mostly beta pleated sheets. It can be further classified into Receptor
Binding domain (RBD) and N-terminal Domain (NTD). The RBD binds to Angiotensin
Converting Enzyme 2 (ACE 2) on the host cells [20]. It lies on the top of the complex, where
around 14 residues from the RBD domain bind to the ACE2 receptor on the host protein [21, 22].
The NTD is the outermost domain that is relatively more exposed and lies on the three sides
giving a triangular shape to the protein when viewed from top (Figure 1). The NTD has a
galectin fold and is known to bind to the sugar moieties [21]. The S2 domain on the other hand is
a transmem rane region with strong inter hain onding etween the residues t is mostly αhelical and forms a triangle when viewed from bottom, though there is no overlapping of the top
and bottom triangles.

Temperature is a very significant variable parameter for proteins because proteins respond
differently in high and low temperature conditions. Many proteins have high thermal stability
while others can unfold or even denature at high temperatures [23, 24]. During November, 2019,

the understanding of the molecular level changes that are taking place in the virus due to the
different weather conditions. Till date, there is no concrete evidence on whether atmospheric
conditions actually influence the structure of the virus.

Here, by using all atom molecular dynamics (MD) simulations we explore the dynamics of the
Spike glycoprotein of SARS-COV-2 at different temperatures. This is the first molecular study
on the environmental influence on the protein structure. Results suggest that S1 domain is more
flexible than S2. In the S1 domain, we observed the sensitivity of the receptor binding motif to
different temperatures. We also found that the N-terminal domain of the protein has the potential
of binding to different human receptors. The study will not only help us in understanding the
nature of the virus but is also useful to design effective therapeutic strategies.

RESULTS AND DISCUSSION

The crystal structure of the Spike glycoprotein (PDB: 6VXX) was found to have 871 missing
residues. Thus, for our study we considered the complete model of the trimeric Spike protein
generated by Zhang et. al. and had a Template modeling score of 0.6 [27]. The model was devoid
of N-acetyl glucosamine (NAG) sugar moieties which are known to bind and stabilize the protein.
The envelope lipid bilayer was not considered in the work to avoid large system size in atomistic
simulations.

fter initial minimization and equili ration we generated five different systems

having temperatures ranging from 1

to

at an interval of 10 degrees. This was done to

maintain the uniformity of the simulations, where temperature was the only variable that was
different. n addition a temperature of

possible deformation in the structure of spike protein, although this high temperature is not
realistic to imitate the environmental condition (Table S1). Production run for 200ns was carried
out in isothermal isobaric (NPT) ensemble.

A.

Spike glycoproteins are sensitive to temperature

After performing 200ns of classical Molecular dynamics simulations, the root mean square
deviation (RMSD) of the trajectory, with respect to the starting structure, was calculated to check
if the systems have attained stability. Figure S1 shows the complete RMSD of all the systems at
different temperatures. It can be seen that the stability was attained within the first

simulation time thus indi ating that the systems are well equili rated The R S values lie

glycoprotein resides, the S2 domain shows remarkable stability in its RMSD values (Figure 2).
The stability of the S2 domain can be conferred to the strong interchain interactions among the
highly α-helical S2 domain.

Since the Spike protein is a homotrimer, the S1 domain of individual domains was also checked
to account for the difference in fluctuations. Figure 2(c) - (e) shows the RMSD of S1 domain of
chains A, B and C at different temperatures. In chain A, it can be clearly seen how the RMSD is
quite high at temperatures of 30 C and

quite negligible and the system is very stable. Similarly, for chain B at 10

and

the

chains were stable. In the S1 domain of chain C, except for simulation at 40 C, at all other
temperatures, the RMSD values were found to be quite low along the length of the simulation
time. The above data indicates that the protein chains, especially the S1 domains are quite
flexible around the temperatures of 20-40 C in comparison to low temperatures of 10

B. Domain flexibility of S1 is more pronounced

In order to identify the region on the Spike protein that causes the deviations in RMSDs, we
plotted the root mean square fluctuation (RMSF) of CA atoms of both S1 and S2 domains
separately (Figure 3) at different temperatures. Each plot shows the RMSF of each individual
chain at different temperatures. The RMSF of individual chains of S1 domain at different
temperatures show that the residues ranging from 1-333 which constitute the N-Terminal

ranging from residues 334-680. In the NTD, three distinct peaks could be seen, viz:- residues 8590, 100-200 and 240-260. The first peak in the NTD was observed around residues 85-90 β β

The rystal stru ture

(PDB: 6VXX) had shown as many as three glycosylated groups adjacent to this region of the

the peaks were found for a wider range of residues. This indicates differential flexibility of
the RBM at different temperatures. Since, the RBM is involved directly in binding to the ACE2
human receptor, its altered behavior at different temperatures would affect the protein-protein
interaction.

The RMSF of S2 domain on the other hand shows marked stability compared to domain S1
(Figure S4). This is in good agreement to our earlier observations of the RMSD of the S2 domain.
Since it is a triple helical coil, the coiled-coil motif of the S2 domain which is further supported
by three shorter helices supports domain stability [29]. However, the C-terminal residues 11251273 show greater flexibility compared to the rest of the domain. It should be noted that the C-

terminal region of the Spike glycoprotein is exposed towards the inner side of the envelope
bilayer and does not participate in the interchain interactions. It also has a more relaxed packing
compared to the rest of the S2 [28, 30].

C. NTD of the Spike protein could act as a receptor binding site

Although, the NTD is not known to directly bind to the receptor, in Mouse hepatitis coronavirus,
it was found that the NTD binds to a CEACAM1a receptor [31]. Similarly, vaccines developed
against the NTD of Spike protein in mice, had shown that NTD can also be a potential
therapeutic target [32, 33]. Moreover, comparison between Bovine coronavirus and Bovine
hemagglutinin-esterase enzyme indicated close evolutionary link between the virus and the host
proteins, which could facilitate attachment in the host cells [34]. We performed a Multiple
Sequence Alignment (MSA) of the SARS-CoV-2 coronavirus NTD with the human proteome to
find similarity of NTD with human proteins

Figure 4 shows the phylogenetic tree based on fast minimum evolution. The tree was constructed
from the results of protein Blast (Blastp) where the maximum allowed difference was 0.85
(details discussed in Materials and Methods). Results show similarity between the NTD and
Briakunumab antibodies, anti-TSLP antibodies, Ephrin receptors, GABAA receptor, Leucine
rich repeat containing Protein 4c, Kremen A receptor protein and N-galactosaminyltransferase.
The remarkable similarity of the NTD with several human antibodies and receptor proteins
indicate the possibility of the domain to be able to bind to different proteins in human. For
instance, the Ephrin receptors are one of the largest proteins of receptor tyrosine kinases which
are involved in angiogenesis, retinogenic signaling, axon guiding and in the migration of the

epithelial cells of the intestines [1]. The possibility of the NTD acting as a receptor binding
domain cannot be ruled out completely. There is also an uncanny correlation between the
prevailing literature where scientists claim the virus affecting different parts of the human body
and the similarity of NTD with human proteins [1, 35].

The NTD is relatively more exposed to solvents and more susceptible to external environmental
conditions. However unlike RBD, the NT doesn’t have a defined open or losed onformation
The coronavirus NTD is composed of three layered beta-sheet sandwich with 7, 3 and 6
antiparallel β strands in ea h layer making it a total of 1

that the loops are oriented close to each other at temperatures 10-30 C, however at 40 C and

proteins that binds to the Ephrin A receptors; we compared the residues involved in protein12

protein interaction in the crystal structure of the human EphA4 ectodomain in complex with
human Ephrin A5 for comparison. (PDB ID: 4BKA). There are three salt bridges and seven
hydrogen bonds between the Ephrin protein and its receptor. Moreover, it can be clearly seen
that the NTD loops host a large number of polar residues (Figure 5). These residues form a stable
motif at temperatures 10-30 C, primarily due to the stability between the loops. At 40 C and
50 C, hydrophobic patch from N-terminal β strand is exposed towards the solvent. The polar
residues from β -β1 and β1 -β1 move away from the N-terminal β strand and the β -β loop,
reducing the possibility of protein-protein interaction. Hence, a strong possibility exists for the
NTD to act as a protein binding site at lower temperature ranges.

From the bioinformatics and structural analyses, we observed that the NTD not only acts as a
glycan binding site but can also as a site for binding of several human proteins. The motif formed
out of several polar residues on the solvent exposed loops at 1 -

ould form salt-bridges and

hydrogen bonds with partner proteins. At higher temperatures, the propensity of forming such
interactions would be lost owing to the differential orientation of the loops. Nonetheless, the
NTD could act as a possible target for development of vaccines and inhibitors.

D. The RBD behaves differently at higher temperatures.

The receptor binding domain (RBD) of the Spike glycoprotein is a potential target for vaccine
and drug development [36, 37]. It is highly conserved among the human coronaviruses and binds
to ACE2 receptor present on the lung tissues [38]. Residues 458-506 of the RBD domain
comprises of the receptor binding motif (RBM). The RBM has 8 residues which are identical and

5 residues with similar biochemical properties between SARS, MERS and SARS-COV-2. This
conserved region primarily interacts with the ACE2 receptor and hence, often scientists target the
RBD domain of for developing therapeutic agents [36, 37, and 39]. Earlier in Figure 2, we saw
that the RBD domain spanning from residues 333-680 shows higher stability when compared to
the NTD of the S1 domain at different range of temperatures.

We compared the time averaged conformation of the RBD generated from the last 10ns of the
simulation time at different temperatures

However, a tighter and well packed structure was found for the protein at 50 C. The figures
suggest that although residue wise movements in RBD were not visible in RMSF (Figure 2), the
RBD domains and motifs show intrinsic flexibility along particular temperature ranges. Previous
studies have indicated that the RBD domain can adopt either an open or a closed conformation in
the virus [18]. We compared the conformation of the Spikeprotein-ACE2 crystal structure and
found that in the open conformation, the RBD exposes its RBM residues Phe456, Ala475,

To validate the findings, we ran another simulation of the Spike protein at a higher temperature
of 70 C. After 100ns of simulation, we found that significant similarity between the closed
conformation observed at 50 C and the conformation at 70 C. The RBM residues, specifically
Phe456, Ala475, Phe486, Asn487, Tyr489, Gln493, Gly496, Gln498, Thr500, Asn501, Gly502
and Tyr505 were found to be clearly buried between the interchain subunits at 70 C (Figure 7,

C, the Spike RBM is completely closed (Figure 7). The closing of the

RBM buries the receptor binding residues inside trimer abolishing the possibility of contacts
with the ACE2 receptor and making the Spike protein inactive. Our results clearly show that the
activity of the Spike protein is dependent on the external temperatures where a higher
temperature renders it completely inactive.

CONCLUSION

The SARS-CoV-2 has severely affected the human population with large number of infected
individuals around world. The propensity of virus to survive in cold and dry climatic conditions
have been speculated by researchers and supported by the statistical evidence from earlier SARS
epidemic of 2002. However, it is still unclear how the virus undergoes changes at the structural
level in different environments. The Spike protein of the virus helps in the attachment and entry
of the coronaviruses inside the host cells. It exists as a homotrimer and is partly exposed to the
outer environment and partly immersed inside the lipid bilayer of the viral envelope. Here, we
studied the differential response of the Spike protein at different temperature conditions.

Our results show that the S2 transmembrane domain remains stable even without the bilayer
membrane, whereas the solvent exposed S1 domain is quite flexible. Moreover, the S1 comprises
of two subdomains, namely N-terminal domain (NTD) and the receptor binding domain (RBD).
The simulations results show that the RBD is relatively less mobile. Its flexibility is limited only
to the receptor binding motif or RBM which interacts with the Angiotensin Converting enzyme 2
(ACE2), its human receptor. However, the NTD was found to be quite mobile.

Although, the NTD doesn’t dire tly intera t with the

re eptor in humans, it has been

found to bind to receptors in other mammals [31]. The flexible NTD hosts a large number of
charged residues on the top layer of its tri-layered beta sandwi h ar hite ture

the NTD sequence with the several human receptors such as Ephrins, Briakunumab, anti-TSLP,
etc indicated a possibility of the subdomain to be involved in binding to alternate human proteins.

The RBM present on the RBD is very crucial in initial protein-protein interaction between the
host and virus. We found that this domain is largely in an open conformation which enables
receptor binding at lower temperatures. Surprisingly, from

C, a closed conformation of the

motif was observed. In this conformation, the RBM from the three chains come very close to
ea h other sealing the visi ility of the trimeri pore

t temperatures

C, the Spike RBM is

completely closed. The closing of the RBM buries the receptor binding residues inside trimer
abolishing the possibility of contacts with the ACE2 receptor and making the Spike protein
inactive.

Our results have shown for the first time that the Spike protein has the possibility to stay in an
active and inactive state based on the external temperature. Since no visible loss of secondary
structure was observed at higher temperatures, it would be interesting to know if the
conformational change is reversible in nature. Nevertheless, this work would prove very
beneficial in the development of vaccines as well as development of therapeutic strategies that
target not only the receptor binding domain but also the N-Terminal Domain of the Spike protein.

MATERIALS AND METHODS

The complete model of the Spike glycoprotein of SARS-COV-2 was obtained from Zhang lab
(GenBank: QHD43416.1). This model was considered because it had modeled the missing 871
residues that were missing in the crystal structure 6VXX. It had a Template Modeling (TM)
score of 0.6 [27]. The initial Root Mean Square Deviation (RMSD) between the model and the
closed crystal structure of Spike glycoprotein (PDB ID 6VXX) was found to be 1.54 Å. The
model was devoid of N-acetyl glycosamine (NAG) glycan residues and consisted of the
glycoprotein trimer where each monomer had aminoacids ranging from 1 to 1273. The structure
was initially solvated with a water box having a cubic box of size 17.9 x 17.9 x 17.9 nm and
569293 atoms with water and ions. The minimum distance between the protein and the edge of
the water box was fixed at 13 Å. Particle-Mesh Ewald (PME) method was used for electrostatic
interactions using a grids pacing of 0.16nm and a 1.0 nm cutoff. After energy minimization and
equilibration, by maintaining harmonic restraints on the protein heavy atoms, the system was
gradually heated to 300K in a canonical ensemble. The harmonic restraints were gradually
reduced to zero and solvent density was adjusted under isobaric and isothermal conditions at 1
atm and 300 K. This was followed by 500ps NVT and 500ps NPT equilibration with harmonic
restraints of 1000 kJ mol-1 nm-2 on the heavy atoms. Production run for all the systems was
carried out for 200ns till it reached a stable RMSD. All simulations were carried out in Gromacs
2020 with AMBERff99SB-ILDN forcefield for proteins [40, 41]. The long-range electrostatic
interactions were treated by using Particle-Mesh Ewald sum and SHAKE was used to constrain
all bonds involving hydrogen atoms. After equilibration, systems were heated or cooled at
different temperatures (Table S1) and simulated for 200ns. All analyses were carried out using

Gromacs analysis tools [40]. Protein Blast was used to search similar sequences in the human
proteome. The Blast Tree View widget helped us generate the phylogenetic tree which is a
simple distance based clustering of the sequences based on pairwise alignment results of Blast
relative to the query sequence [42]. VMD was used for visualization of results and generation of
figures [43].

Figure 1: Structure of the Spike glycoprotein. The Spike glycoprotein, S1 and S2 domains, in
the absence of glycan residues and lipid bilayer. The S1 domain is shown in pink and S2 in
iceblue color. The top view of the protein shows a triangular arrangement of the S1 domain.
Below the structure is a schematic showing the location of important regions on the S1 and S2
domains of the protein. The abbreviations in the S1 and S2 domains are: - NTD- N-Terminal
Domain; RBD- Receptor Binding Domain; RBM- Receptor Binding Motif. The starting and
ending residues are numbered.
