Abstract
The RNA polymerase inhibitor, favipiravir, is currently in clinical trials as a
treatment for infection with SARS-CoV-2, despite limited information about
the molecular basis for its activity. Here we report the structure of favipiravir
ribonucleoside triphosphate (favipiravir-RTP) in complex with the SARS-CoV-2
RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp) bound to a template:primer RNA
duplex, determined by electron cryomicroscopy (cryoEM) to a resolution of
2.5 Å. The structure shows clear evidence for the inhibitor at the catalytic
site of the enzyme, and resolves the conformation of key side chains and ions
surrounding the binding pocket. Polymerase activity assays indicate that the
inhibitor is weakly incorporated into the RNA primer strand, and suppresses
RNA replication in the presence of natural nucleotides. The structure reveals
an unusual, non-productive binding mode of favipiravir-RTP at the catalytic
site of SARS-CoV-2 RdRp which explains its low rate of incorporation into the
RNA primer strand. Together, these findings inform current and future efforts
to develop polymerase inhibitors for SARS coronaviruses.

Introduction
The 2019-2020 coronavirus pandemic has spurred research into novel and
existing anti-viral treatments. The SARS-CoV-2 viral RNA-dependent RNA
polymerase, crucial for coronavirus replication and transcription, is a promising
drug target for the treatment of COVID-19 [1]. Nucleoside analogues, including
remdesivir, sofosubivir and favipiravir (T-705), have been shown to have a broad
spectrum of activity against viral polymerases [2], and are being trialed against
SARS-CoV-2 infections [3, 4, 5]. Recent results of the World Health Organization SOLIDARITY clinical trials indicate that remdesivir, hydroxychloroquine,
lopinavir and interferon treatment regimens appeared to have little or no effect
on hospitalized COVID-19 patients, as measured by overall mortality, initiation of ventilation and duration of hospital stays [6], so insight into the modes
action and mechanisms of current and future drugs for COVID-19 is increasingly important. The structures of the SARS-CoV RdRp [7], the SARS-CoV-2
RdRp [8], the SARS-CoV-2 polymerase bound to an RNA duplex [9], to RNA
and remdesivir [10, 11], and to the helicase nsp13 [12] were all recently determined by electron cryomicroscopy (cryoEM). The suggested modes of action of
favipiravir, a purine nucleic acid analogue derived from pyrazine carboxamide (6fluoro-3-hydroxy-2-pyrazinecarboxamide), against coronaviruses comprises nonobligate chain termination, slowed RNA synthesis, and mutagenesis of the viral
genome [13]. Here we report the structure of the SARS-CoV-2 RdRp, comprising
subunits nsp7, nsp8 and nsp12, in complex with template:primer double-stranded
RNA and favipiravir ribonucleoside triphosphate (favipiravir-RTP), determined
by cryoEM at 2.5 Å resolution.
Materials and methods

from Sigma-Aldrich or Link Technologies and used without further purification.
Acetonitrile and other reagents (cap solutions, de-block solution and oxidizer
solution) were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich. Primer Support 5G for A, G,
C or U (with loading at ∼300 µmol/g) respectively, was purchased from GE
Healthcare.
Spectroscopy of chemical compounds
Mass spectra were acquired on an Agilent 1200 LC-MS system equipped with
an electrospray ionization (ESI) source and a 6130 quadrupole spectrometer
(LC solvents: A, 0.2% formic acid in H2 O and B, 0.2% formic acid in acetonitrile).

31

P-Nuclear magnetic resonance (31 P-NMR) spectra of the T-705-RTP

stock solution were acquired using a Bruker Ultrashield 400 Plus operating at
162 MHz.
Protein purification
The gene-optimized cassette (GeneArts/Thermo Fisher) encoding a SARSCoV-2 RdRp polyprotein, codon optimized for Spodoptera frugiperda, containing
nsp5-nsp7-nsp8-nsp12 was cloned, with a C-terminal TEV-double StrepII tag,
into a pU1 vector for a modified MultiBac baculovirus/insect cell expression [14].
The cell pellet was lysed in a buffer of 50 mM Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), 250 mM NaCl,
2 mM MgCl2 , 1 mM DTT, and loaded onto a Strep-Tactin column (Qiagen).
The protein complex was eluted in lysis buffer supplemented with 5 mM desthiobiotin. The RdRp was further purified by size exclusion chromatography on a
Superdex 200 16/60 size-exclusion column (Cytiva) in a buffer of 20 mM HEPES
(pH 7.5), 200 mM NaCl, 2 mM MgCl2 and 1 mM TCEP. Fractions containing
nsp7-nsp8-nsp12 were concentrated, flash-frozen in liquid nitrogen, and stored
at −80◦ C as single-use aliquots.
Nsp7 and nsp8 were cloned into the NcoI-NotI, and BamHI-NotI sites of
pAcycDuet1 (Millipore), and a pET28 vector modified to encode an N-terminal
6x-His-Sumo tag in frame with the multiple policloning site. Protein expression
was pursued in Escherichia coli (E. coli ) BL21(DE3) Star cells co-transformed
with the nsp7 and nsp8 plasmids. Cells were grown in ZY auto-induction media

[15] at 37◦ C, until an optical density at 600 nm of 0.8 was attained, at which
point the temperature was reduced to 18◦ C, and the incubation was continued
overnight. Cells were lysed by sonication in a buffer containing 500 mM NaCl,
20 mM HEPES pH 7.5, 5 mM benzamidine, 20 mM imidazole, 1 mM TCEP.
Proteins were captured with Co2+ -conjugated-IMAC resin (Cytvia), eluted in
a buffer containing 300 mM NaCl, 20 mM HEPES pH 7.5, 300 mM imidazole,
1 mM TCEP, followed by overnight cleavage of the 6x-His-Sumo tag by Ulp1,
and subjected to subtractive IMAC to remove cleaved tags, uncleaved nsp8,
and Ulp1. The nsp7-nsp8-containing solution was then diluted to 150 mM
NaCl, further purified via cation-exchange, and size exclusion chromatography
in assembly buffer (100 mM NaCl, 20 mM HEPES pH 7.5, 2 mM MgCl2 , and
1 mM TCEP; Superdex 200 16/60, Cytiva). Fractions containing nsp7-nsp8
were concentrated, flash-frozen in liquid nitrogen, and stored at −80◦ C as singleuse aliquots.
RNA synthesis
The RNA template, 5’-rUrUrUrUrUrCrArUrArArCrUrUrArArUrCrUrCrAr
CrArUrArGrCrArCrUrG-3’, and RNA primer 5’-rCrArGrUrGrCrUrArUrGrUr
GrArGrArUrUrArArGrUrUrArU-3’ were prepared by solid phase synthesis on
an ÄKTA oligopilot plus 10 (GE Healthcare). RNAs were cleaved from the
solid support by treating with 4 mL of a 1:1 mixture of 28% wt NH3 /H2 O
solution and 33% wt CH3 NH2 /EtOH solution at 55◦ C for 30 minutes, then
the silyl protecting groups were removed by treating with 3 mL of 1:1 mixture
of triethylamine trihydrofluoride and DMSO at 55◦ C for 90 minutes. Then,
30 mL of cold 50 mM NaClO4 in acetone was added to precipitate the RNA
product. After centrifugation, the pellet of RNA was dissolved in 5 mL of
water and passed through a Sep-Pack C18 Cartridge, 5 g sorbent (Waters).
Eluates containing RNA were combined and lyophilized. Mass spectroscopy of
the template RNA, found m/z ([M-7H+ ]) = 1341.8 (theoretical 1342.1), found
m/z ([M-6H+ ]) = 1565.6 (theoretical 1565.9); and of the primer RNA, found
m/z ([M-6H+ ]) = 1278.6 (theoretical 1278.9), found m/z ([M-5H+ ]) = 1534.5

(theoretical 1534.9).
Annealing of primer:template RNA duplexes
Single-stranded primer and template RNAs (Fig. 1A) were resuspended
in deionized and purified H2 O to a final concentration of 200 µM, mixed at
an equimolar ratio, and incubated for 5 minutes in a heat block at 95◦ C in
Eppendorf tubes with punctured lids. The heat block was then removed from the
heating device and allowed to cool to ambient temperature. Annealed dsRNAs
were then dispensed as single-use aliquots, flash frozen in liquid nitrogen, and
stored at −80◦ C.
Assembly of the apo-RdRp complex
Purified apo-RdRp, assembled as above, was mixed immediately after purification with annealed dsRNA, resuspended in ddH2 O, to a final protein:RNA
concentration of 8:20 µM, and was incubated at room temperature for 5 minutes
prior to addition of favipiravir-RTP to a final concentration of 100 µM. Thereafter, complexes were incubated for an additional 30 minutes at room temperature, prior to another round of centrifugation at 4◦ C, transferred to fresh Eppendorf tubes, and used immediately for the preparation of cryoEM grids.
Primer extension, drug incorporation, and replication inhibition assays
All assays (Fig. 1 B-C) were performed at room temperature in assembly
buffer. Reaction conditions were designed to approximate as closely as possible
those employed in production of vitrified EM grids. For primer extension assays,
6 µM RdRp (prepared as above) was assembled with 6 µM dsRNA, and mixed
with rATP/rGTP (at a final concentration of 500 µM). For drug incorporation assays, RdRp:dsRNA complexes were assembled, mixed with favipiravirRTP (at final concentrations of 10, 100, and 500 µM), and reactions allowed to
proceed. For replication inhibition assays, RdRp:dsRNA complexes were assembled, preincubated with favipiravir-RTP (at final concentrations of 10, 100, and
500 µM) for a period of 30 minutes, prior to addition of rATP/rGTP to a final
concentration of 500 µM. Samples were removed at the indicated time points (0,

30, and 90 minutes); the reactions were stopped with a 1:1 addition of quenching
buffer (98% formamide, 10 mM EDTA), flash frozen and stored at −21◦ C prior
to gel analyses.
Specimen analysis
20% polyacrylamide, 8 M urea gels (0.75 mm thick, 20 cm long) were run
at 15 W in TBE buffer for 2 hours. The RNA gel was stained using SYBR
Gold Nucleic Acid Gel Stain (Invitrogen). Fluorescence imaging was performed
using an Amersham Typhoon imager (GE Healthcare) and quantified using
Image Quant TL software (version 7.0).
CryoEM and atomic model building
The complex, prepared as described above, was used at a concentration
of 1.3 mg/mL for preparing cryoEM grids. All-gold HexAuFoil grids with a
hexagonal array of 280 nm diameter holes, 700 nm hole-to-hole spacing, and
330 Å foil thickness were made in-house, and plasma treated as described in
[16]. Graphene was grown by chemical vapor deposition, transferred onto allgold UltrAuFoil R0.6/1 grids (QuantiFoil), and partially hydrogenated following
a previously described procedure [17]. Grids were rapidly cooled using a manual
plunger [18] in a 4◦ C cold room. A 3 µL volume of the protein solution was
pipetted onto the foil side of the grid and then blotted from the same side with
filter paper (Whatman No. 1) for 11-14 seconds. The grids were immediately
plunged into liquid ethane, kept at 93K in a cryostat [19], and were stored in
liquid nitrogen until they were imaged in the electron cryomicroscope.
We acquired electron micrographs from four grids: three HexAuFoil grids
(total 52,881 multiframe micrographs) and one partially hydrogenated graphenecoated grid (11,096 multiframe micrographs) (Fig.

2A, Table S1).

Other

surfaces that were screened during initial specimen preparation included graphene
functionalized with amylamine or hexanoic acid and graphene oxide, none of
which improved the orientation distribution or yielded 2D classes indicating
degradation of the complex more severe than due to the air-water interface

alone. Thus, they were not included in the dataset for high-resolution reconstruction. The high density of foil holes on the HexAuFoil grid, combined with
fast imaging by aberration-free image shift and a fast, direct-electron detector
(Falcon 4, 240 Hz) allowed us to acquire more than 200 micrographs per hour
for 14 consecutive days. The number of micrographs that can be acquired from
a single HexAuFoil grid is limited only by the ice contamination rate in the
vacuum of the electron microscope, rather than by the number of holes on one
grid, even with the fastest available data collection setups.
All data were processed in RELION 3.1 [20], using particle picks imported
from crYOLO 1.5 [21] (Fig. S1) with manual retraining of the model. After
four rounds of 2D classification, it was clear that the specimen adopted a
preferred orientation (Fig. 2B), as previously reported [9]. The uniformity of the
particle orientation distribution, and the isotropy of the final 3D reconstruction,
were improved by combining data from HexAuFoil and partially hydrogenated
graphene-coated UltrAuFoil EM grids (Fig. 2C). After three rounds of 3D classification, we obtained a 2.5 Å resolution isotropic map of the full complex from
40,828 particles (Fig. 2D-E). A different set of 140,639 particles produced a
2.5 Å resolution map of the nsp12 subunit alone. The remaining 99% of the
particles were discarded, as these corresponded to either the over-represented
view of the nsp12 subunit alone, or to structurally heterogeneous complexes
that did not align to high resolution.
Optical aberrations were refined per grid, the astigmatism per micrograph,
and the defocus per particle. Particle movement during irradiation was tracked
separately for the graphene and the HexAuFoil datasets, using Bayesian polishing
[22]. The dataset on graphene shows typical beam induced motion at the onset
of irradiation, whereas this movement is eliminated by the use of the HexAuFoil
grids, which provided superior data quality, especially at the onset of irradiation, when the specimen is least damaged. Of the particles contributing to
the final 3D refinement, 80% originated from the HexAuFoil grids, and 20%
from the partially hydrogenated graphene grid. This was necessary to improve
the particle orientation distribution: the efficiency, Eod , increased from 0.54 in

unsupported ice, and 0.57 on partially hydrogenated graphene to 0.68 using a
combination of particles from both support surfaces (Fig. 2C) [23]. External
reconstruction in SIDESPLITTER was performed [24]. The atomic model was
built based on a previously published atomic model of the nsp12-nsp7-nsp8
complex bound to RNA and remdesivir-RTP (PDB-7BV2) [10], with manual
model building in Coot [25, 26], and real-space refinement in Phenix [27].
Results
To confirm the integrity of the assembled nsp7-nsp8-nsp12 SARS-CoV-2
RdRp complexes, we first performed primer extension activity assays. Consistent with prior publications, we observed efficient primer extension in the presence of natural ribonucleotide triphosphates (rNTPs) (Fig. 1A-B: lanes 4-6)
[8, 9, 10, 12, 11]. Having verified the activity of the reconstituted RdRp, we
then investigated the ability of the enzyme to incorporate favipiravir-RTP into
the primer strand. In contrast to natural rNTPs, favipiravir-RTP appears to be
a comparably poor substrate, with a low fraction of primer extension observed
over the range of experimental conditions tested (Fig. 1C: lanes 7-15). The
formation of larger RNA products observed at later time-points (in particular
lanes 12 and 15), must arise through promiscuous base-pairing with both uracil
and cytosine in the template strand, and is consistent with the reported mutagenicity of favipiravir towards viral genomic RNA in vivo [28, 29, 13]. Finally,
we tested whether favipiravir-RTP can inhibit primer extension in the presence
of rNTPs. Despite the low incorporation of favipiravir-RTP observed in primer
extension assays, it nevertheless suppresses completion of RNA replication at
all concentrations tested, even when rNTPs are present at a considerable excess
over the inhibitor (Fig. 1C: lanes 16-24). These assays are thus consistent with a
previously proposed mode of action of favipiravir-RTP, comprising both slowed
RNA synthesis and non-obligate chain termination [13].
To investigate the structural basis of this activity, we determined the structure of the nsp7-nsp8-nsp12 SARS-CoV-2 RdRp complex, in the presence of
template:primer RNA and favipiravir-RTP, by cryoEM (Fig. 2, Fig. S1, Fig.
8

S2, Table S1). The overall structure of the polymerase complex observed (Fig.
3A, Fig.

S3), comprising one nsp12, one nsp7, two nsp8 subunits, and a

template:primer RNA, is nearly identical to those previously described [10, 9].
With 2.5 Å resolution, and the reduced effects of radiation damage afforded by
movement-free imaging [16], the map we determined is suitable for unambiguous
atomic model building. We resolved and modelled some additional density in the
N-terminal nidovirus RdRp-associated nucleotidyltransferase (NiRAN) domain
of nsp12, including a pyrophosphate and a Mg2+ ion (Fig. 3B). These are
surrounded by residues which are conserved between SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2,
including K73, R116, D218 of the active site of the NiRAN domain [12]. However,
we did not find density for a possible nucleotide linked to the pyrophosphate at
this site. A previous study [11] also observed density consistent with a pyrophosphate, only in a pre-translocated RdRP-RNA complex, but did not attribute it
due to insufficient resolution.
We found that favipiravir and two catalytic Mg2+ ions are present at the
catalytic site of the complex (Fig. 3C, Fig. S2). Favipiravir is stacked onto the
3’ nucleotide of the primer strand, and forms a non-canonical base pair, through
its amide group, with the displayed cytidine in the template RNA strand, consistent with favipiravir mimicking a guanosine base. The weaker density for the
inhibitor, compared to that for the neighboring RNA bases, indicates partial
occupancy of the site. The density is most consistent with the inhibitor binding
non-covalently to the polymerase, with little to no covalent incorporation. The
biochemical assays indicated only minimal incorporation of favipiravir-RTP into
the primer under the conditions used to prepare the complex for structural
analysis (Fig. 1; lane 11). Density for the α and β phosphates, which are
coordinated by two neighboring magnesium ions, can be clearly traced. The
density for the favipiravir base appears discontinuous from the density for the
ribose bound to it; however, we verified using spectroscopy that the glycosidic
bond was stable in conditions used to prepare the complex for cryoEM (Fig.
S4). We also observed a weak signal, adjacent to the trisphosphate moiety of
favipiravir-RTP, consistent with a pyrophosphate molecule.

revealed that the supplied favipiravir-RTP contained pyrophosphate contaminant at approximately equivalent amounts to the favipiravir-RTP inhibitor (Fig.
S5). We show that pyrophosphate does not inhibit RdRp activity in the presence
of rNTPs (Fig. S6). Pyrophosphate was modelled at this site in the SARS-CoV2 RdRp nsp12-RNA-remdesivir complex (PDB ID 7BV2) [10]. However, in the
influenza RNA polymerase this site is occupied by the trisphosphate of the
incoming rNTP (PDB 6SZV [30]). In contrast, the current structure indicates
that favipiravir-RTP is bound at the RdRp catalytic site in a non-productive
configuration, as discussed below.
We observe signal for the RNA base pairs as synthesized, indicating no
translocation of the RNA has occurred in the majority of the intact complexes
during the incubation period of 30 minutes. This supports the interpretation
that favipiravir stalls replication by non-covalent interactions at the active site,
rather than by covalent incorporation into the replicating strand. Neither base
stacking nor base pairing distances in the presence of favipiravir differ from those
expected for natural nucleotides. In addition to base-pairing with cytosine from
the template strand, favipiravir is coordinated by Lysine 545 in the F1 domain
of nsp12, which is positioned to accept hydrogen bonds from the nitrogen atom
in the pyrazine ring or donate to the fluorine atom of the inhibitor, although in
both instances the distances are long (3.4 Å and 3.7 Å, respectively), suggesting
possible water-mediated contacts. These interactions are potentially functionally important because an arginine substitution of the equivalent residues in the
chikungunya virus (CHIKV) and influenza virus H1N1 RdRp’s is responsible
for their decreased susceptibility to favipiravir [2, 31]. Two nearby arginines
(R553, R555) in the nucleoside entry channel are flexible, with no signal visible
for the guanidinium group of R555. The 2’ hydroxyl of the favipiravir nucleotide
analogue forms a hydrogen bond to residue N691 of nsp12. A serine (S682) is
positioned, as previously hypothesized [9], to play a role in coordinating the
nucleotide for incorporation. The hydrophobic valine (V557) is stacked against
the +1 base in the RNA template.

Discussion
In this study, we determined the cryoEM structure of favipiravir-RTP at
the catalytic site of the SARS-CoV-2 RdRp, in complex with template:primer
dsRNA, and investigated the influence of this nucleotide analogue inhibitor on
RNA synthesis in vitro. We observed that favipiravir-RTP is an inefficient
substrate for the viral RdRp in primer extension assays, and propose that
this is a consequence of a catalytically unproductive conformation adopted by
the drug in the polymerase active site. The non-productive binding mode of
favipiravir-RTP to the catalytic site of RdRp observed here explains the inefficient rate of covalent incorporation in primer extension assays. In the binding
mode reported here, the β-phosphate of favipiravir-RTP is not aligned for in-line
nucleophilic attack by the 3’OH of the P−1 nucleotide. An optimal geometry
would require rotation of the ribose O5’-αP bond by 120◦ . The structure of a
productive influenza polymerase RNA-rNTP complex (PDB-6SZV) [30] showed
that the triphosphates of the P+1 nucleotide engage the site possibly occupied by pyrophosphate (the product of rNTP incorporation) in the structure
reported here (Fig. 4, Fig. S3). One might hypothesize that, pyrophosphate
contributes to the slow rate of favipiravir-RTP incorporation by directing the
triphosphate moiety of favipiravir-RTP into a non-productive binding mode.
However, pyrophosphate inhibition assays (Fig. S6) indicate that pyrophosphate at concentrations between 10 and 500 µM does not affect the replication
activity of RdRp. We therefore suggest that the non-productive configuration
of favipiravir-RTP is promoted by an intrinsic feature of the favipiravir moiety.
One possibility is that water-mediated hydrogen bonds linking the fluorine atom
of the pyrazine ring to the oxygen atoms of the β-phosphate group to reconfigure
the triphosphate into a non-productive position, although we do not unambiguously identify water molecules bound to favipiravir-RTP in the map at this
resolution. In support of this mechanism, T-1105-RTP, which lacks the fluorine, is a more efficient substrate than favipiravir-RTP for SARS-CoV-2 RdRp
[13].

While this manuscript was in preparation, another cryoEM reconstruction
and an associated atomic structure of the RdRP:dsRNA:favipiravir-RTP complex
became publicly available (EMD-30469, PDB 7CTT) [32]. This map is distorted
along one direction, an artefact characteristic of anisotropic filling of Fourier
space in the reconstruction. Multiple factors, including complex dissociation,
denaturation at the air water interface, and preferred orientation, also impeded
our initial attempts for high-resolution structure determination of this complex.
We managed to circumvent these by acquiring a large cryoEM dataset and
using a combination of HexAuFoil and partially hydrogenated graphene-coated
UltrAuFoil EM grids. We make the complete dataset publicly available via
the Electron Microscopy Public Image Archive (accession number 10517) in the
hope that it will be useful for software development for handling large data sets
of structurally heterogeneous cryoEM specimens.
For now, cryoEM structure determination of this RdRp-RNA complex in
combination with different inhibitors remains far from a routine task. Still, this
and other published structures of the complex will aid rational drug design,
and, in the interim, biochemical optimization of the stability of the complex
might help yield a specimen that is more stable in the thin layers of buffer used
for cryoEM. This would then make it suitable for rapid structure determination amongst an array of candidate compounds. The need for a derivatized
graphene surface to overcome the strong interactions with the air-water interfaces highlights the problem that surfaces present in cryoEM specimen preparation; further improvements in the specimen preparation process are still needed
to enable high throughput for drug design and analysis.
The structure reported here suggests at least three possible directions for
further efforts towards drug design against the SARS-CoV-2 RdRp. The first is
modification of the favipiravir-RTP to bring the α-phosphate into a more favorable confirmation for covalent incorporation at the terminus of the extending

High resolution structure determination may aid in these directions as new
compounds are developed and tested as treatments for COVID-19.

favipiravir-RTP (FTP). (A) Sequence of the annealed primer (top):template (bottom)
dsRNA duplex employed in biochemical assays. (B) Reconstituted SARS-CoV-2 RdRp
extends the 24mer primer in the presence (lanes 4-6), but not the absence (lanes 1-3), of
ribonucleotides (rNTPs). A 31mer product is present in lane 6 due to addition of a nontemplated base to the primer strand. (C) Favipiravir is weakly incorporated into the 24mer
primer strand (lanes 7-15), and suppresses RNA replication by the SARS-CoV-2 RdRp.

coordinated by key conserved residues in this domain. (C) The template:primer RNA duplex
is shown, along with favipiravir at the catalytic site (+1) of the polymerase. Hydrogen bonds
are indicated.

Coordination of favipiravir-RTP in the active site of the
SARS-CoV-2 RdRp. (A) A non-productive conformation of favipiravir-RTP (F-RTP),
base-paired to the P+1 nucleotide of the template strand, as shown, was observed in the
cryoEM density map. For clarity, the primer strand is omitted and only the P+1 and P−1
nucleotides of the template strand are shown. (B) The non-productive conformation may be
favored in the presence of pyrophosphate (PPi), which is a possible by-product from the incorporation of rNTPs into the RNA. (C) A hypothetical productive conformation of favipiravirRTP, which may lead to its incorporation into the primer RNA strand, is modelled. (D) For
comparison, the position of an incoming non-hydrolyzable UTP analog in the bat influenza
polymerase elongation complex is shown (PDB-6SZV) [30].

the data processing, from particle picking, through classification, to final maps. A selected
subset of the initial reference-free 2D class averages and all the intermediate 3D class averages
computed during the processing of this dataset are shown. All 3D class averages, selected for
subsequent rounds of processing, are boxed in gray, and the number of particles in each of
these is shown. Further attempts to process the discarded classes are omitted from this chart
for clarity, as these data did not contribute to the final particle set.

containing 1 mM Tris buffer at pH 7.5. The doublet at δ = −6.7 ppm was assigned
to one of the α- or γ-phosphates of the triphosphate moiety, the other expected doublet
might have been broadened by chelation to traces of paramagnetic metal ions. The triplet at
δ = −22.1 ppm was assigned to the β-phosphate of the triphosphate moiety. The singlet with
δ = −7.6 ppm is assigned to inorganic pyrophosphate, a potential contaminant associated
with the process of synthesizing T-705-RTP. The singlet with δ = −21.6 ppm is tentatively
assigned to cyclic trimetaphosphate.

or absence of rNTPs and/or inorganic pyrophosphate (PPi), and RNA products were resolved
by denaturing acrylamide gel electrophoresis and visualized by SYBR Gold staining. The
presence of pyrophosphate at concentrations between 10 and 500 µM does not affect the RNA
replication by the RdRp.
