Abstract
The severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is the causative agent of
the COVID-19 pandemic. Computer simulations of complete viral particles can provide theoretical
insights into large-scale viral processes including assembly, budding, egress, entry, and fusion.
Detailed atomistic simulations, however, are constrained to shorter timescales and require billionatom simulations for these processes. Here, we report the current status and on-going
development of a largely “bottom-up” coarse-grained (CG) model of the SARS-CoV-2 virion.
Structural data from a combination of cryo-electron microscopy (cryo-EM), x-ray crystallography,
and computational predictions were used to build molecular models of structural SARS-CoV-2
proteins, which were then assembled into a complete virion model. We describe how CG
molecular interactions can be derived from all-atom simulations, how viral behavior difficult to
capture in atomistic simulations can be incorporated into the CG models, and how the CG models
can be iteratively improved as new data becomes publicly available. Our initial CG model and the
detailed methods presented are intended to serve as a resource for researchers working on
COVID-19 who are interested in performing multiscale simulations of the SARS-CoV-2 virion.

Significance Statement
This study reports the construction of a molecular model for the SARS-CoV-2 virion and details
our multiscale approach towards model refinement. The resulting model and methods can be
applied to and enable the simulation of SARS-CoV-2 virions.

Main Text
Introduction
The onset of the global COVID-19 pandemic has brought intense investigation into the molecular
components of SARS-CoV-2 encoded by the virus’s 30 kilobase (kb) genome. Structural biology
efforts using cryo-electron microscopy (cryo-EM) and x-ray crystallographic techniques are
currently reporting new structures of viral proteins every week (1–12), and computational
structure prediction efforts are targeting unresolved sections of the genome using a variety of
protein folding algorithms. Computational and experimental studies are underway to find new
molecular therapeutics that can inhibit viral activity or further elucidate the mechanisms of action
of SARS-CoV-2 proteins (13–16). The computer simulation of large-scale SARS-CoV-2
processes, such as virion assembly, budding, entry, and fusion, will remain intrinsically
challenging to investigate using all-atom (AA) molecular dynamics (MD), owing to the
computational cost of meaningfully simulating the hundred of millions to billions of atoms
involved.
A holistic model of the SARS-CoV-2 virion can provide insight into the mechanisms of
large-scale viral processes and the collective behavior of macromolecules involved in viral
replication and infectivity. SARS-CoV-2 virions contain four main structural proteins: the spike (S),
membrane (M), nucleocapsid (N), and envelope (E) proteins (17). S proteins are glycosylated
trimers that mediate fusion and entry, in part by attaching enclosed fusion peptide sequences into
the membranes of host cells (18). M proteins appear as dimeric complexes embedded within the
virion envelope, and are believed to anchor ribonucleoprotein complexes to the envelope (19,
20). N proteins associate with and organize RNA into ribonucleoprotein structures found in the
interior of virions (21, 22). Lastly, E proteins are thought to form pentameric ion channels that are
found at the lipid bilayers of virion membranes and contribute to viral budding (23).
In this paper, we construct a largely “bottom-up” coarse-grained (CG) model of the
SARS-CoV-2 virion from the currently available structural and atomistic simulation data on SARSCoV-2 proteins. In general, this model serves as a resource for researchers working on COVID19, and as a platform to incorporate computational and experimental data. This model also
enables the multiscale study of SARS-CoV-2 processes for the development of treatment and

prevention strategies against COVID-19. Atomistic trajectory and experimental structural data
deposited in the NSF Molecular Sciences Software Institute (MolSSI) will be incorporated, as they
become publicly available (24). In this work, we detail several of our CG methods used to
iteratively develop a CG model for the full SARS-CoV-2 virion, in which molecular interactions
between CG particles are derived using a combination of phenomenological, experimental, and
atomistic simulation approaches.

Theory and Methodology
Building models from structural data
We first constructed atomic models of the structural proteins of the SARS-CoV-2 virion, (Figure
1). AA models of the open and closed state of the S protein were built based on the cryo-EM
structures of the spike ectodomain (PDB ID: 6VYB, 6VXX) (5), respectively, and atomic models of
the N protein were constructed based on the x-ray crystallographic structure of the nucleocapsid
NTD (PDB ID: 6M3M) (25). Glycosylation sites were modeled using Glycan Reader & Modeler in
CHARMM-GUI (26) and the site-specific glycoprofile derived from mass spectrometry and cryoEM analysis (27, 28). Homology models for the S protein stalk, including the HR2 and TM
domains were assembled as α-helical trimeric bundles using MODELLER (29) on the basis of
secondary structure assignments in JPred4 (30). Homology models for the SARS-CoV-2 N
protein CTD were created from the x-ray crystallographic structure of the SARS-CoV N protein
CTD (PDB ID: 2CJR) (31). Missing amino acid backbones in loop regions were built in
MODELLER, and side chain rotamers were built using SCWRL4 (32). For the M protein dimer
and the pentameric E ion channel, we used atomic models derived in the recent Critical
Assessment of Structure Prediction (CASP) Commons competition (33, 34).
AA protein models (see discussion below) were subsequently simulated and coarsegrained to generate the CG models (Figure 2 and see sections below). A previously developed
CG model for lipids was used, consisting of three CG beads per lipid and distinct bead types for
lipid head groups and hydrophobic tails (35). A single component CG lipid bilayer was generated
in a spherical configuration and equilibrated using CG molecular dynamics simulations under
constant NVT conditions in LAMMPS (36). We note that in the future more complex CG lipid

models (37) can be added. Transmembrane segments of component membrane proteins were
visually identified and assigned based on secondary structure motifs. Individual lipids on the outer
leaflet of the spherical bilayer were randomly selected and used as initial positions for embedding
spike, membrane, and envelope proteins. For each initial position, the center-of-mass of the
transmembrane domain was aligned with the center of the lipid bilayer, and the principal axis of
the protein was aligned with the vector normal to the lipid bilayer. Transmembrane regions were
then substituted for the overlapping CG lipids to embed the proteins. The procedure was iterated
until a spike, membrane, and envelope protein density on the virion surface was achieved that
was approximately consistent with current available experimental estimates of ~25, 1000, and 20
per virion, respectively, from cryo-EM and biochemical data (38–40). The diameter of the
membrane envelope is approximately 100 nm and 120 nm including the S proteins on the virion
surface. As higher-resolution experimental data are released, the overall structure of this model
can be refined.

AA MD simulations of the S protein
Two glycosylated models of the open and closed spike were inserted into a symmetric 225 Å ×
225 Å lipid bilayer mimicking the composition of the endoplasmic reticulum-Golgi intermediate
compartment (41, 42). The lipid patch was built using CHARMM-GUI. The complete proteinmembrane system was solvated with using the TIP3P water model (43), and neutralized with
chloride and sodium ions to maintain a 150 mM concentration. Each system contained ~1.7
million atoms. Minimization and equilibration was performed using the CHARMM36 forcefield (44,
45) and NAMD 2.14 (46). Production runs were performed in the NPT ensemble using a Langevin
thermostat at 310K and Nosé-Hoover Langevin barostat at 1 atm. All production runs used a 2-fs
timestep and the SHAKE algorithm. Multiple replicas of AA MD simulations of the open (3x) and
closed (3x) systems were performed on NSF Frontera at the Texas Advanced Computing Center
(TACC), achieving an aggregate sampling of 3.0 and 1.8 µs, respectively.

The CG model of the glycosylated S protein (Figure 2 A) was parameterized from the AA MD
simulations described below (47). Reference statistics used conformations sampled equally from
both open and closed states with AA trajectories spanning the 3.0 and 1.8 µs, respectively. First,
the protein was mapped to CG beads using essential dynamics coarse-graining (EDCG) (48). We
used 60 and 50 CG beads for the S1 and S2 domains, respectively, and the 22 N-linked glycans
were each mapped to a single bead. Intra-protein interactions were represented as a hetero-

ensemble at 310K and 1 atm using the CHARMM36m forcefield. A CG model containing

approximately 5 residues per CG bead was mapped from the reference statistics of the AA MD
simulations using the EDCG (Figure 2C), and hENM approaches. A CG model for the E protein
was developed by linearly mapping the amino acid sequence to particles at a resolution of 1 CG
bead per 5 amino acids (Figure 2B).

CG model of the N protein
Several studies suggest that the C-terminal domain (CTD) of the N protein assembles into a helix
that contains two RNA binding grooves (21, 51). Based on these studies, we constructed atomic
and CG models of the viral ribonucleoprotein complex (vRNP) by iterating between CG and AA
simulations. We first constructed an atomic model of the N protein CTD helix with two RNA
binding grooves by stacking 3 copies of the CTD octamer structure (PDB: 2CJR), which is
composed of 4 CTD dimers and homology modeled from the X-ray crystallographic structure of
the SARS-CoV N protein CTD (31). The CTD helix was simulated in the CHARMM36m force field
for 400 ns. We then constructed the CTD helix model using EDCG combined with hENM followed
by manually placing CG RNA beads into the groove of the helix (Figure 2D). The positions of the
CG beads were used as restraints to build an atomic model of the vRNP complex. Finally, the
vRNP model was relaxed and simulated in the CHARMM36m force field for 400 ns. It is important
to note that recent cryo-EM studies have found granule-like densities within the virion for the
vRNP complex (22). Structural detail into how CTD oligomers (including the previously proposed
helical model) and RNA fit into these densities will likely require higher-resolution images.

Deriving CG molecular interactions from AA simulations
Several computational approaches have been developed to build or refine CG models using data
from AA or fine-grained simulations. Our approach to coarse-graining the SARS-CoV-2 virion is to
couple several CG methods in a hierarchical fashion. CG sites or “beads” are mapped from
atomic structures using EDCG, a method designed to preserve the principal modes of motion

After defining the AA B CG map, intramolecular interactions within a single polypeptide

models is determined by the molecular behavior sampled in the underlying AA simulations.

Incorporating new behavior in CG simulations
Macromolecular complexes, such as virions, undergo a wide range of behavior including physical
and chemical transitions that will be difficult to capture through AA simulations alone, as well as
experimental techniques. This is especially true for processes that involve large conformational
changes that are not sampled effectively in AA simulations, whether due to the long timescales
required, free energy barriers, or inherent limitations of the simulation force field. For instance, the
S protein of SARS-CoV-2 exhibits two proteolytic cleavage sites (at the S1/S2 and S2’ locations)
as well as binding to the host cell receptor, angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE-2). Cleavage
and binding events trigger dramatic conformational changes in the spike that result in the
insertion of the fusion peptide into the host cell membrane. High-resolution structural studies of
the S-ACE-2 complex have made protein binding simulations amenable to enhanced sampling
techniques at the AA level (4, 56). The proteolytic cleavage of the spike and large-scale
conformational shift towards fusion peptide insertion, however, are more difficult to sample in

atomistic simulations. To address these issues, one can use CG molecular simulation techniques
that allow CG particles to adaptively switch discrete “states” and interactions, such as “UltraCoarse-Graining” (UCG) (57–59). In the limit of infrequent internal state switches, UCG
implements microscopically reversible state changes are coupled to a Metropolis Hastings like

parameters either treated as input or calculated from atomistic simulations. This approach is
similar to hybrid kinetic Monte-Carlo and MD methods, but with a spatial kinematic component,
and it can be used to examine the transitions of the spike (its “states”) that lead to the fusion of
SARS-CoV-2 with host cells.
Experiments can probe longer timescales than are available from AA MD simulations. In
recent cryo-EM images of SARS-CoV-2 particles, the S1 domain of the S protein was found to
transiently open and close in order to bind the ACE-2 receptor (3, 5), which are subtle
conformational changes that are difficult to sample in atomistic simulations. For these
conformational changes – in the case that they cannot be treated as discrete state switches –
plastic network models (60) or multi-configuration coarse graining (MCCG) methods (61) can be
used to construct a CG model that continuously transitions from one state to the next. For plastic
network models, two known experimental configurations of the protein are used to build a multibasin ENM that represents deviations away from each of the individual conformational minima. A
phenomenological interaction Hamiltonian is constructed that couples and mixes the ENMs
between the two structural endpoints. In MCCG, the primary difference is that the coupling terms
in the Hamiltonian are constructed from a two-state mixing approach, derived on the basis of a
mapped potential of mean force which is explicitly computed from AA simulation data along
collective variables that distinguish between the two (or more) conformational states at a CG
level.

Phenomenological CG models
An alternative (and sometimes necessary “top-down”) route to deriving CG models is to construct
a model Hamiltonian and then analyze the model’s resulting behavior in the context of the
assumed interactions. Typically, parameterization of such models is designed to fit or reproduce
particular observables measured in experimental data and perhaps particular sets of AA
simulation data. These can be performed based on variational optimization of some systemspecific functional that depends on the experimental observable. Model Hamiltonian approaches
have the advantage that physical intuition is clearer, but are not systematic, since each new
problem requires a different treatment for the set of interactions involved. Furthermore, these
approaches often require orthogonal experiments to validate the underlying model. Such coarsegraining methods are, however, especially useful in cases where atomistic simulation and/or
experimental data is difficult or infeasible to obtain on the system or if the bottom-up methods
described above are not expected to yield converged results for the CG effective potential, owing
to limited atomistic sampling.

Early Results
Here we present results from the first CG simulations of the SARS-CoV-2 virion (Figure 3). It
should be noted that these are early results and we can thus expect additional simulations to
become available from this model as more experimental data and AA simulations become
available for the various virion components. In addition, the overall CG methodology and
modeling of the virion will continue to evolve, and are works in progress.
A CGMD simulation was performed on the complete CG virion model using LAMMPS for

10 R 105 CG timesteps (see Supplementary Movie 1). The system was energy minimized using
conjugate gradient descent. A temperature of 300K was maintained with a Langevin thermostat,
with a damping constant (K678  10 ps and 100 fs timestep. Statistics were collected every 100
CG timesteps. Several radial distributions functions (RDFs) or pair correlations between CG
particles were computed for the MD trajectories of individual S proteins and compared to the
mapped AA reference statistics from which the models were derived (Figure 4 A). In general, the

CG model captured the positions and peaks in the pair correlation functions; however, error in the
fine structure of the peaks was also present, indicating that refinement involving the addition of
more expressive basis CG potentials (e.g., splines) may be necessary.
We performed principal component analysis (PCA) on a subset of the CG particles to
examine collective modes of motion of the virion (Figure 4B). The Cartesian coordinates of 1

Supplementary Movie 4) accounts for 7.0% of the total variance and corresponds to twisting of
the S1/S2 during CGMD. In general, there was a high degree of variance in the S protein, and
these correlated modes of motion are likely informative of how the virion collectively utilizes spike
proteins to explore and detect receptors. Longer CG simulations with more expressive CG
models will likely be required to uncover additional modes of motion in the virion, including modes
that involve the structural M, N, and E proteins.

Conclusions and Outlook
This work provides an initial CG molecular model of the SARS-CoV-2 virion and details a bottomup CG approach capable of further refining the model as new atomistic and experimental data
becomes available. Currently, the lipid envelope is described using a particle-based
phenomenological model with a soft tunable bending modulus well suited for large-scale
membrane deformations, whereas the M and E proteins are modeled as rigid bodies. Intra-spike
interactions were developed using relative entropy minimization approaches on the basis of
extensive, microsecond AA simulations of the spike protein. The N protein is modeled on the
basis of AA simulations of helical oligomers in complex with RNA. Cross-interactions between the
lipids and structural proteins are modeled using attractive Gaussian potentials between the

hydrophobic lipid tails and the transmembrane domains of membrane proteins. This virion model
will be iteratively refined and improved as structural, biochemical, and AA trajectory data are
publicly released. The construction of an integrated CG model from individual atomistic
simulations will also be benefited by new developments in systematic methods for ensuring
consistency between CG models developed from the reference statistics of those simulations. In
particular, methods that variationally optimize in a “divide and conquer” fashion on the basis of
joint statistics will likely improve model fidelity. Nonetheless, despite these noted challenges, we
find that the behavior of SARS-CoV-2 structural proteins is coupled in the virion.
Coarse-grained simulations of viral processes have helped elucidate a wide range of
mechanisms in viruses. For example in HIV, CG simulations contributed to the understanding of
the self-assembly of the capsid (62) and innate immune sensor recognition and block of viral
activity (63), as well as its inhibition by drug molecules (64). Atomistic simulations of ligand
binding have also revealed a variety of unexpected, drug-targetable protein-ligand interaction
sites (65–71). It is likely that molecular probes into the processes the involving a holistic model of
the SARS-CoV-2 virion can reveal new therapeutic strategies that exploit viral mechanisms
involving large-scale behavior.

Figure 2. CG models of the SARS-CoV-2 structural proteins. (A) The CG model of the S
protein trimer in the open state. The protein monomers are depicted as pink, green, and cyan
beads, respectively; the monomer in pink has an exposed receptor binding domain. Each of the
22(x3) N-linked glycans are depicted as grey beads. (B) The CG model of the pentameric E
protein is depicted as orange beads. (C) The CG M dimer model is depicted as yellow and blue
spheres, overlaid on top of the AA model of the M dimer. Each monomer has 36 CG sites, and
the red lines indicate the approximate positions of the transmembrane region. (D) The CG model
of the N protein CTD helix in complex with viral RNA. The N protein helix and bonds derived from
the hENM are depicted in cyan, while the RNA is depicted as orange beads.

Figure 3. A multiscale model of the SARS-CoV-2 virion. (A) Exterior view of the SARS-CoV-2
virion. (B) Interior view of the SARS-CoV-2 virion. Spike (S) protein trimers are depicted in teal
with the glycosylation sites represented as black spheres. Membrane (M) protein dimers are in
blue, with pentameric envelope (E) ion channels in orange. The density of S,M, and E proteins
was chosen to be consistent experiments (38–40). N proteins are not shown. The diameter of the
membrane envelope is approximately 100 nm and 120 nm including the S proteins on the virion
surface.

Figure 4: Analysis of the CGMD simulations of the SARS-CoV-2 virion. (A) Radial
distribution functions (RDFs) showing the comparison between mapped all-atom reference
statistics and the CG spike model during the MD simulations. The measured RDFs are for CG
particles that were mapped from the following all-atom residues of (i) S1,RBD [S459–D467] and
S1,NTD [W104–L118], (ii) S1,preRBD [E309–R319] and S2 [A852–L861], (iii) S2,CH [A1015–K1028],
and (iv) S2,CTD [Y1215–V1228]. (B) Principal modes of motion of the SARS-CoV-2 virion
computed from the CGMD simulation (see also Supplementary Movie 2–4). The first principal
component (PC1) accounts for 51% of the total variation observed during simulation, whereas the
second (PC2) and third (PC3) account for 12.5% and 7%, respectively.
