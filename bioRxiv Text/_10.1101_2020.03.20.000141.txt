Abstract
To ultimately combat the emerging COVID-19 pandemic, it is desired to develop an

18

effective and safe vaccine against this highly contagious disease caused by the SARS-CoV-2

19

coronavirus. Our literature and clinical trial survey showed that the whole virus, as well as the

20

spike (S) protein, nucleocapsid (N) protein, and membrane (M) protein, have been tested for

21

vaccine development against SARS and MERS. However, these vaccine candidates might lack

22

the induction of complete protection and have safety concerns. We then applied the Vaxign

23

reverse vaccinology tool and the newly developed Vaxign-ML machine learning tool to predict

24

COVID-19 vaccine candidates. By investigating the entire proteome of SARS-CoV-2, six

25

proteins, including the S protein and five non-structural proteins (nsp3, 3CL-pro, and nsp8-10),

26

were predicted to be adhesins, which are crucial to the viral adhering and host invasion. The S,

27

nsp3, and nsp8 proteins were also predicted by Vaxign-ML to induce high protective

28

antigenicity. Besides the commonly used S protein, the nsp3 protein has not been tested in any

29

coronavirus vaccine studies and was selected for further investigation. The nsp3 was found to be

30

more conserved among SARS-CoV-2, SARS-CoV, and MERS-CoV than among 15

31

coronaviruses infecting human and other animals. The protein was also predicted to contain

32

promiscuous MHC-I and MHC-II T-cell epitopes, and linear B-cell epitopes localized in specific

33

locations and functional domains of the protein. By applying reverse vaccinology and machine

34

learning, we predicted potential vaccine targets for effective and safe COVID-19 vaccine

35

development. We then propose that an “Sp/Nsp cocktail vaccine” containing a structural

36

protein(s) (Sp) and a non-structural protein(s) (Nsp) would stimulate effective complementary

37

immune responses.

Introduction
The emerging Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic poses a massive crisis to

42

global public health. As of March 11, 2020, there were 118,326 confirmed cases and 4,292

43

deaths, according to the World Health Organization (WHO), and WHO declared the COVID-19

44

as a pandemic on the same day. As of March 22, there were >300,000 confirmed cases and

45

>10,000 deaths globally in at least 167 countries, and the USA reported >27,000 confirmed cases

46

and >300 deaths. It is critical to develop an effective and safe vaccine(s) to control this fast-

47

spreading disease and stop the pandemic.

48

The causative agent of the COVID-19 disease is the severe acute respiratory syndrome

49

coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). Coronaviruses can cause animal diseases such as avian infectious

50

bronchitis caused by the infectious bronchitis virus (IBV), and pig transmissible gastroenteritis

51

caused by a porcine coronavirus1. Bats are commonly regarded as the natural reservoir of

52

coronaviruses, which can be transmitted to humans and other animals after genetic mutations.

53

There are seven known human coronaviruses, including the novel SARS-CoV-2. Four of them

54

(HCoV-HKU1, HCoV-OC43, HCoV-229E, and HCoV-NL63) have been circulating in the

55

human population worldwide and cause mild symptoms2. Coronavirus became prominence after

56

Severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) and Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS)

57

outbreaks. In 2003, the SARS disease caused by the SARS-associated coronavirus (SARS-CoV)

58

infected over 8,000 people worldwide and was contained in the summer of 20033. SARS-CoV-2

59

and SARS-CoV share high sequence identity4. The MERS disease infected more than 2,000

60

people, which is caused by the MERS-associated coronavirus (MERS-CoV) and was first

61

reported in Saudi Arabia and spread to several other countries since 20125.

62

Although great efforts have been made to develop and manufacture COVID-19 vaccines,

63

there is no human vaccine on the market to prevent this highly infectious disease. Coronaviruses

64

are positively-stranded RNA viruses with its genome packed inside the nucleocapsid (N) protein

65

and enveloped by the membrane (M) protein, envelope (E) protein, and the spike (S) protein6.

66

While many coronavirus vaccine studies targeting different structural proteins were conducted,

67

most of these efforts eventually ceased soon after the outbreak of SARS and MERS. With the

68

recent COVID-19 pandemic outbreak, it is urgent to resume the coronavirus vaccine research. As

69

the immediate response to the on-going pandemic, the first testing in humans of the mRNA-

70

based vaccine targeting the S protein of SARS-CoV-2 (ClinicalTrials.gov Identifier:

71

NCT04283461, Table 1) started on March 16, 2020. As the most superficial and protrusive

72

protein of the coronaviruses, S protein plays a crucial role in mediating virus entry. In the SARS

73

vaccine development, the full-length S protein and its S1 subunit (which contains receptor

74

binding domain) have been frequently used as the vaccine antigens due to their ability to induce

75

neutralizing antibodies that prevent host cell entry and infection.

76

However, the current coronavirus vaccines, including S protein-based vaccines, might

77

have issues in the lack of inducing complete protection and possible safety concerns7,8. All

78

existing SARS/MERS vaccines were reported to induce neutralizing antibodies and partial

79

protection against the viral challenges in animal models (Table 2), but it is desired to induce

80

complete protection or sterile immunity. Moreover, it has become increasingly clear that multiple

81

immune responses, including those induced by humoral or cell-mediated immunity, are

82

responsible for correlates of protection than antibody titers alone9. Both killed SARS-CoV whole

83

virus vaccine and adenovirus-based recombinant vector vaccines expressing S or N proteins

84

induced neutralizing antibody responses but did not provide complete protection in animal

85

model10. A study has shown increased liver pathology in the vaccinated ferrets immunized with

86

modified vaccinia Ankara-S recombinant vaccine11. The safety and efficacy of these vaccination

87

strategies have not been fully tested in human clinical trials, but the safety can be a major

88

concern. Therefore, novel strategies are needed to enhance the efficacy and safety of COVID-19

89

vaccine development.

90

In recent years, the development of vaccine design has been revolutionized by the reverse

91

vaccinology (RV), which aims to first identify promising vaccine candidate through

92

bioinformatics analysis of the pathogen genome. RV has been successfully applied to vaccine

93

discovery for pathogens such as Group B meningococcus and led to the license Bexsero

94

vaccine12. Among current RV prediction tools13,14, Vaxign is the first web-based RV program15

95

and has been used to successfully predict vaccine candidates against different bacterial and viral

96

pathogens16–18. Recently we have also developed a machine learning approach called Vaxign-ML

97

to enhance prediction accuracy19.

98
99

In this study, we first surveyed the existing coronavirus vaccine development status, and
then applied the Vaxign RV and Vaxign-ML approaches to predict COVID-19 protein

100

candidates for vaccine development. We identified six possible adhesins, including the structural

101

S protein and five other non-structural proteins, and three of them (S, nsp3, and nsp8 proteins)

102

were predicted to induce high protective immunity. The S protein was predicted to have the

103

highest protective antigenicity score, and it has been extensively studied as the target of

104

coronavirus vaccines by other researchers. The sequence conservation and immunogenicity of

105

the multi-domain nsp3 protein, which was predicted to have the second-highest protective

106

antigenicity score yet, was further analyzed in this study. Based on the predicted structural S

114

Published research and clinical trial coronavirus vaccine studies
To better understand the current status of coronavirus vaccine development, we

115

systematically surveyed the development of vaccines for coronavirus from the ClinicalTrials.gov

116

database and PubMed literature (as of March 17, 2020). Extensive effort has been made to

117

develop a safe and effective vaccine against SARS or MERS, and the most advance clinical trial

118

study is currently at phase II (Table 1). It is a challenging task to quickly develop a safe and

119

effective vaccine for the on-going COVID-19 pandemic.

120

There are two primary design strategies for coronavirus vaccine development: the usage

121

of the whole virus or genetically engineered vaccine antigens that can be delivered through

122

different formats. The whole virus vaccines include inactivated20 or live attenuated vaccines21,22

123

(Table 2). The two live attenuated SARS vaccines mutated the exoribonuclease and envelop

124

protein to reduce the virulence and/or replication capability of the SARS-CoV. Overall, the

125

whole virus vaccines can induce a strong immune response and protect against coronavirus

126

infections. Genetically engineered vaccines that target specific coronavirus protein are often used

127

to improve vaccine safety and efficacy. The coronavirus antigens such as S protein, N protein,

128

and M protein can be delivered as recombinant DNA vaccine and viral vector vaccine (Table 2).

129
130

N protein is conserved among SARS-CoV-2, SARS-CoV, and MERS-CoV, but missing from

131

the other four human coronaviruses causing mild symptoms

132

We first used the Vaxign analysis framework15,19 to compare the full proteomes of seven

133

human coronavirus strains (SARS-CoV-2, SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV, HCoV-229E, HCoV-

134

OC43, HCoV-NL63, and HCoV-HKU1). The proteins of SARS-CoV-2 were used as the seed for

135

the pan-genomic comparative analysis. The Vaxign pan-genomic analysis reported only the N

136

protein in SARS-CoV-2 having high sequence similarity among the more severe form of

137

coronavirus (SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV), while having low sequence similarity among the

138

more typically mild HCoV-229E, HCoV-OC43, HCoV-NL63, and HCoV-HKU1. The sequence

139

conservation suggested the potential of N protein as a candidate for the cross-protective vaccine

140

against SARS and MERS. The N protein was also evaluated and used for vaccine development

141

(Table 2). The N protein packs the coronavirus RNA to form the helical nucleocapsid in virion

142

assembly. This protein is more conserved than the S protein and was reported to induce an

143

immune response and neutralize coronavirus infections23. However, a study also showed the

144

linkage between N protein and severe pneumonia or other serious liver failures related to the

145

pathogenesis of SARS24.

146
147

Six adhesive proteins in SARS-CoV-2 identified as potential vaccine targets

148

The Vaxign RV analysis predicted six SARS-CoV-2 proteins (S protein, nsp3, 3CL-PRO,

149

and nsp8-10) as adhesive proteins (Table 3). Adhesin plays a critical role in the virus adhering to

150

the host cell and facilitating the virus entry to the host cell25, which has a significant association

151

with the vaccine-induced protection26. In SARS-CoV-2, S protein was predicted to be adhesin,

152

matching its primary role in virus entry. The structure of SARS-CoV-2 S protein was determined27

153

and reported to contribute to the host cell entry by interacting with the angiotensin-converting

154

enzyme 2 (ACE2)28. Besides S protein, the other five predicted adhesive proteins were all non-

155

structural proteins. In particular, nsp3 is the largest non-structural protein of SARS-CoV-2

156

comprises various functional domains29.

157
158

Three adhesin proteins were predicted to induce strong protective immunity

159

The Vaxign-ML pipeline computed the protegenicity (protective antigenicity) score and

160

predicted the induction of protective immunity by a vaccine candidate19. The training data

161

consisted of viral protective antigens, which were tested to be protective in at least one animal

162

challenge model30. The performance of the Vaxign-ML models was evaluated (Table S1 and

163

Figure S1), and the best performing model had a weighted F1-score of 0.94. Using the optimized

164

Vaxign-ML model, we predicted three proteins (S protein, nsp3, and nsp8) as vaccine candidates

165

with significant protegenicity scores (Table 3). The S protein was predicted to have the highest

166

protegenicity score, which is consistent with the experimental observations reported in the

167

literature. The nsp3 protein is the second most promising vaccine candidate besides S protein.

168

There was currently no study of nsp3 as a vaccine target. The structure and functions of this protein

169

have various roles in coronavirus infection, including replication and pathogenesis (immune

170

evasion and virus survival) 29. Therefore, we selected nsp3 for further investigation, as described

171

below.

172
173

Nsp3 as a vaccine candidate

174

The multiple sequence alignment and the resulting phylogeny of nsp3 protein showed that

175

this protein in SARS-CoV-2 was more closely related to the human coronaviruses SARS-CoV and

176

MERS-CoV, and bat coronaviruses BtCoV/HKU3, BtCoV/HKU4, and BtCoV/HKU9. We studied

177

the genetic conservation of nsp3 protein (Figure 1A) in seven human coronaviruses and eight

178

coronaviruses infecting other animals (Table S2). The five human coronaviruses, SARS-CoV-2,

179

SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV, HCoV-HKU1, and HCoV-OC43, belong to the beta-coronavirus while

180

HCoV-229E and HCoV-NL63 belong to the alpha-coronavirus. The HCoV-HKU1 and HCoV-

181

OC43, as the human coronavirus with mild symptoms clustered together with murine MHV-A59.

182

The more severe form of human coronavirus SARS-CoV-2, SARS-CoV, and MERS-CoV grouped

183

with three bat coronaviruses BtCoV/HKU3, BtCoV/HKU4, and BtCoV/HKU9.

184

When evaluating the amino acid conservations relative to the functional domains in nsp3,

185

all protein domains, except the hypervariable region (HVR), macro-domain 1 (MAC1) and beta-

186

coronavirus-specific marker βSM, showed higher conservation in SARS-CoV-2, SARS-CoV, and

187

MERS-CoV (Figure 1B). The amino acid conservation between the major human coronavirus

188

(SARS-CoV-2, SARS-CoV, and MERS-CoV) was plotted and compared to all 15 coronaviruses

189

used to generate the phylogenetic of nsp3 protein (Figure 1B). The SARS-CoV domains were also

190

plotted (Figure 1B), with the relative position in the multiple sequence alignment (MSA) of all 15

191

coronaviruses (Table S3 and Figure S2).

192

The immunogenicity of nsp3 protein in terms of T cell MHC-I & MHC-II and linear B cell

193

epitopes was also investigated. There were 28 and 42 promiscuous epitopes predicted to bind the

194

reference MHC-I & MHC-II alleles, which covered the majority of the world population,

195

respectively (Table S4-5). In terms of linear B cell epitopes, there were 14 epitopes with BepiPred

196

scores over 0.55 and had at least ten amino acids in length (Table S6). The 3D structure of SARS-

197

CoV-2 protein was plotted and highlighted with the T cell MHC-I & MHC-II, and linear B cell

198

epitopes (Figure 2). The predicted B cell epitopes were more likely located in the distal region of

199

the nsp3 protein structure. Most of the predicted MHC-I & MHC-II epitopes were embedded inside

200

the protein. The sliding averages of T cell MHC-I & MHC-II and linear B cell epitopes were

201

plotted with respect to the tentative SARS-CoV-2 nsp3 protein domains using SARS-CoV nsp3

202

protein as a reference (Figure 3). The ubiquitin-like domain 1 and 2 (Ubl1 and Ubl2) only predicted

203

to have MHC-I epitopes. The Domain Preceding Ubl2 and PL2-PRO (DPUP) domain had only

204

predicted MHC-II epitopes. The PL2-PRO contained both predicted MHC-I and MHC-II epitopes,

205

but not B cell epitopes. In particular, the TM1, TM2, and AH1 were predicted helical regions with

206

high T cell MHC-I and MHC-II epitopes31. The TM1 and TM2 are transmembrane regions passing

207

the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) membrane. The HVR, MAC2, MAC3, nucleic-acid binding

208

domain (NAB), βSM, Nsp3 ectodomain; (3Ecto), Y1, and CoV-Y domain contained predicted B

209

cell epitopes. Finally, the Vaxign RV framework also predicted 2 regions (position 251-260 and

210

329-337) in the MAC1 domain of nsp3 domain having high sequence similarity to the human

211

mono-ADP-ribosyltransferase PARP14 (NP_060024.2).

212
213

Discussion

214

Our prediction of the potential SARS-CoV-2 antigens, which could induce protective

215

immunity, provides a timely analysis for the vaccine development against COVID-19. Currently,

216

most coronavirus vaccine studies use the whole inactivated or attenuated virus, or target the

217

structural proteins such as the spike (S) protein, nucleocapsid (N) protein, and membrane (M)

218

protein (Table 2). But the inactivated or attenuated whole virus vaccine might induce strong

219

adverse events. On the other hand, vaccines targeting the structural proteins induce a strong

220

immune response23,32,33. In some studies, these structural proteins, including the S and N proteins,

221

were reported to associate with the pathogenesis of coronavirus24,34 and might raise safety

222

concern11. Our study applied state-of-the-art Vaxign reserve vaccinology (RV) and Vaxign-ML

223

machine learning strategies to the entire SARS-CoV-2 proteomes, including both structural and

224

non-structural proteins for vaccine candidate prediction. Our results indicate, for the first time, that

225

many non-structural proteins could be used as potential vaccine candidates.

226

The SARS-CoV-2 S protein was identified by our Vaxign and Vaxign-ML analysis as the

227

most favorable vaccine candidate. First, the Vaxign RV framework predicted the S protein as a

228

likely adhesin, which is consistent with the role of S protein for the invasion of host cells. Second,

229

our Vaxign-ML predicted that the S protein had a high protective antigenicity score. These results

230

confirmed the role of S protein as the important target of COVID-19 vaccines. However, targeting
8

231

only the S protein may induce high serum-neutralizing antibody titers but cannot induce complete

232

protection10. In addition, HCoV-NL63 also uses S protein and employs the angiotensin-converting

233

enzyme 2 (ACE2) for cellular entry, despite markedly weak pathogenicity35. This suggests that the

234

S protein is not the only factor determining the infection level of a human coronavirus. Thus,

235

alternative vaccine antigens may be considered as potential targets for COVID-19 vaccines.

236

Among the five non-structural proteins being predicted as potential vaccine candidates, the

237

nsp3 protein was predicted to have second-highest protective antigenicity score, adhesin property,

238

promiscuous MHC-I & MHC-II T cell epitopes, and B cell epitopes. The nsp3 is the largest non-

239

structural protein that includes multiple functional domains related to viral pathogenesis29. The

240

multiple sequence alignment of nsp3 also showed higher sequence conservation in most of the

241

functional domains in SARS-CoV-2, SARS-CoV, and MERS-CoV, than in all 15 coronavirus

242

strains (Fig. 1B). Besides the nsp3 protein, our study also predicted four additional non-structural

243

proteins (3CL-pro, nsp8, nsp9, and nsp10) as possible vaccine candidates based on their adhesin

244

probabilities, and the nsp8 protein was also predicted to have a significant protective antigenicity

245

score.

246

However, these predicted non-structural proteins (nasp3, 3CL-pro, nsp8, nsp9, and nsp10)

247

are not part of the viral structural particle, and all the current SARS/MERS/COVID-19 vaccine

248

studies target the structural (S/M/N) proteins. Although structural proteins are commonly used as

249

viral vaccine candidates, non-structural proteins correlates to vaccine protection. The non-

250

structural protein NS1 was found to induce protective immunity against the infections by

251

flaviviruses36. Since NS1 is not part of the virion, antibodies against NS1 have no neutralizing

252

activity but some exhibit complement-fixing activity37. However, passive transfer of anti-NS1

253

antibody or immunization with NS1 conferred protection38. Anti-NS1 antibody could also reduce

254

viral replication by complement-dependent cytotoxicity of infected cells, block NS1-induced

255

pathogenic effects, and attenuate NS1-induced disease development during the critical phase39.

256

Finally, NS1 is not a structural protein and anti-NS1 antibody will not induce antibody-dependent

257

enhancement (ADE), which is a virulence factor and a risk factor causing many adverse events39.

258

The non-structural proteins of the hepatitis C virus were reported to induce HCV-specific vigorous

259

and broad-spectrum T-cell responses40. The non-structural HIV-1 gene products were also shown

260

to be valuable targets for prophylactic or therapeutic vaccines41. Therefore, it is reasonable to

261

consider the SARS-CoV-2 non-structural proteins (e.g., nsp3) as possible vaccine targets, which
9

262

might induce cell-mediated or humoral immunity necessary to prevent viral invasion and/or

263

replication. None of the non-structural proteins have been evaluated as vaccine candidates, and the

264

feasibilit of these proteins as vaccine targets are subject to further experimental verification.

265

In addition to vaccines expressing a single or a combination of structural proteins, here we

266

propose an “Sp/Nsp cocktail vaccine” as an effective strategy for COVID-19 vaccine development.

267

A typical cocktail vaccine includes more than one antigen to cover different aspects of

268

protection42,43. The licensed Group B meningococcus Bexsero vaccine, which was developed via

269

reverse vaccinology, contains three protein antigens12. To develop an efficient and safe COVID-

270

19 cocktail vaccine, an “Sp/Nsp cocktail vaccine”, which mixes a structural protein(s) (Sp, such

271

as S protein) and a non-structural protein(s) (Nsp, such as nsp3) could induce more favorable

272

protective immune responses than vaccines expressing a structural protein(s). The benefit of a

273

cocktail vaccine strategy could induce immunity that can protect the host against not only the S-

274

ACE2 interaction and viral entry to the host cells, but also protect against the accessary non-

275

structural adhesin proteins (e.g., nsp3), which might also be vital to the viral entry and replication.

276

The usage of more than one antigen allows us to reduce the volume of each antigen and thus to

277

reduce the induction of adverse events. Nonetheless, the potentials of the proposed “Sp/Nsp

278

cocktail vaccine” strategy need to be experimentally validated.

279

For rational COVID-19 vaccine development, it is critical to understand the fundamental

280

host-coronavirus interaction and protective immune mechanism7. Such understanding may not

281

only provide us guidance in terms of antigen selection but also facilitate our design of vaccine

282

formulations. For example, an important foundation of our prediction in this study is based on our

283

understanding of the critical role of adhesin as a virulence factor as well as protective antigen. The

284

choice of DNA vaccine, recombinant vaccine vector, and another method of vaccine formulation

285

is also deeply rooted in our understanding of pathogen-specific immune response induction.

286

Different experimental conditions may also affect results44,45. Therefore, it is crucial to understand

287

the underlying molecular and cellular mechanisms for rational vaccine development.

Methods

290

Annotation of literature and database records. We annotated peer-reviewed journal articles

291

stored in the PubMed database and the ClinicalTrials.gov database. From the peer-reviewed

292

articles, we identified and annotated those coronavirus vaccine candidates that were

293

experimentally studied and found to induce protective neutralizing antibody or provided immunity

294

against virulent pathogen challenge.

295
296

Vaxign prediction. The SARS-CoV-2 sequence was obtained from NCBI. All the proteins of six

297

known human coronavirus strains, including SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV, HCoV-229E, HCoV-

298

OC43, HCoV-NL63, and HCoV-HKU1 were extracted from Uniprot proteomes46. The full

299

proteomes of these seven coronaviruses were then analyzed using the Vaxign reverse vaccinology

300

pipeline15,19. The Vaxign program predicted serval biological features, including adhesin

301

probability47, transmembrane helix48, orthologous proteins49, and protein functionss15,19.

302
303

Vaxign-ML prediction. The ML-based RV prediction model was built following a similar

304

methodology described in the Vaxign-ML19. Specifically, the positive samples in the training data

305

included 397 bacterial and 178 viral protective antigens (PAgs) recorded in the Protegen database30

306

after removing homologous proteins with over 30% sequence identity. There were 4,979 negative

307

samples extracted from the corresponding pathogens’ Uniprot proteomes46 with sequence dis-

308

similarity to the PAgs, as described in previous studies50–52. Homologous proteins in the negative

309

samples were also removed. The proteins in the resulting dataset were annotated with biological

310

and physicochemical features. The biological features included adhesin probability47,

311

transmembrane helix48, and immunogenicity53. The physicochemical features included the

312

compositions, transitions and distributions54, quasi-sequence-order55, Moreau-Broto auto-

313

correlation56,57, and Geary auto-correlation58 of various physicochemical properties such as charge,

314

hydrophobicity, polarity, and solvent accessibility59. Five supervised ML classification algorithms,

315

including logistic regression, support vector machine, k-nearest neighbor, random forest

316

extreme gradient boosting (XGB)

317

performance of these models was evaluated using a nested five-fold cross-validation (N5CV)

318

based on the area under receiver operating characteristic curve, precision, recall, weighted F1-

319

score, and Matthew’s correlation coefficient. The best performing XGB model was selected to

320

predict the protegenicity score of all SARS-CoV-2 isolate Wuhan-Hu-1 (GenBank ID:

321

MN908947.3) proteins, downloaded from NCBI. A protein with protegenicity score over 0.9 is

322

considered as strong vaccine candidate(weighted F1-score > 0.94 in N5CV).

324

Phylogenetic analysis. The protein nsp3 was selected for further investigation. The nsp3 proteins

325

of 14 coronaviruses besides SARS-CoV-2 were downloaded from the Uniprot (Table S2). Multiple

326

sequence alignment of these nsp3 proteins was performed using MUSCLE62 and visualized via

327

SEAVIEW63. The phylogenetic tree was constructed using PhyML64, and the amino acid

328

conservation was estimated by the Jensen-Shannon Divergence (JSD)65. The JSD score was also

329

used to generate a sequence conservation line using the nsp3 protein sequences from 4 or 13

330

coronaviruses.

331
332

Immunogenicity analysis. The immunogenicity of the nsp3 protein was evaluated by the

333

prediction of T cell MHC-I and MHC-II, and linear B cell epitopes. For T cell MHC-I epitopes,

334

the IEDB consensus method was used to predicting promiscuous epitopes binding to 4 out of 27

335

MHC-I reference alleles with consensus percentile ranking less than 1.0 score53. For T cell MHC-

336

II epitopes, the IEDB consensus method was used to predicting promiscuous epitopes binding to

337

more than half of the 27 MHC-II reference alleles with consensus percentile ranking less than 10.0.

338

The MHC-I and MHC-II reference alleles covered a wide range of human genetic variation

339

representing the majority of the world population66,67. The linear B cell epitopes were predicted

340

using the BepiPred 2.0 with a cutoff of 0.55 score68. Linear B cell epitopes with at least ten amino

341

acids were mapped to the predicted 3D structure of SARS-CoV-2 nsp3 protein visualized via

342

PyMol69. The predicted count of T cell MHC-I and MHC-II epitopes, and the predicted score of

343

linear B cell epitopes were computed as the sliding averages with a window size of ten amino acids.

344

The nsp3 protein 3D structure was predicted using C-I-Tasser70 available in the Zhang Lab

345

webserver (https://zhanglab.ccmb.med.umich.edu/C-I-TASSER/2019-nCov/).

Figure 1. The phylogeny and sequence conservation of coronavirus nsp3. (A) Phylogeny of 15

539

strains based on the nsp3 protein sequence alignment and phylogeny analysis. (B) The

540

conservation of nsp3 among different coronavirus strains. The red line represents the

541

conservation among the four strains (SARS-CoV, SARS-CoV-2, MERS, and BtCoV-HKU3).

542

The blue line was generated using all the 15 strains. The bottom part represents the nsp3 peptides

543

and their sizes. The phylogenetically close four strains have more conserved nsp3 sequences than

544

all the strains being considered.
