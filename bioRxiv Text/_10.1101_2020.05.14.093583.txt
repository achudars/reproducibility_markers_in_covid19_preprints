ABSTRACT
The novel coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) caused by the severe acute respiratory
syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) has evolved into a worldwide pandemic. Early data
suggest that the prevalence and severity of COVID-19 appear to be higher among patients with
underlying cardiovascular risk factors. Despite the expression of angiotensin-converting enzyme
2 (ACE2), a functional receptor for SARS-CoV-2 infection, in cardiomyocytes, there has been no
conclusive evidence of direct viral infection although the presence of inflammation and viral
genome within the hearts of COVID-19 patients have been reported. Here we transduced A549
lung epithelial cells with lentivirus overexpressing selected genes of the SARS-CoV-2. We then
isolated extracellular vesicles (EVs) from the supernatant of A549 cells and detected the presence
of viral RNA within the purified EVs. Importantly, we observed that human induced pluripotent
stem cell-derived cardiomyocytes (hiPSC-CMs) were able to actively uptake these EVs and viral
genes were subsequently detected in the cardiomyocytes. Accordingly, uptake of EVs containing
viral genes led to an upregulation of inflammation-related genes in hiPSC-CMs. Thus, our findings
indicate that SARS-CoV-2 RNA-containing EVs represent an indirect route of viral RNA entry into
cardiomyocytes.

INTRODUCTION
Since the initial outbreak in China, coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) which is caused by
severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) has evolved into a global
pandemic. While COVID-19 affects both healthy individuals as well as those with comorbid
conditions such as cardiovascular diseases, the severity and risk of adverse outcomes of COVID19 are especially pronounced in the latter1. Furthermore, patients with COVID-19 have also been
reported to exhibit increased levels of cardiac biomarkers, suggestive of cardiac injury2. However,
it remains unclear whether exacerbated cardiac injury seen in COVID-19 patients results directly
from viral SARS-CoV-2 infection of the myocardium or indirectly from the complications of COVID19. Cardiomyocytes express angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2), the SARS-CoV-2 binding
site3. However, there is no evidence of direct viral infection of cardiomyocytes to date, although
the presence of myocardial inflammation and viral particles among the interstitial cells of the
myocardium have been reported4 and viral RNA has also detected in some COVID-19 patients’
hearts5. The majority of cells in the body are known to release lipid bilayer membrane vesicles,
also known as extracellular vesicles (EVs), that are capable of transferring various genetic
materials including viral RNAs to other recipient cells6, 7. Therefore, in the present work, we
hypothesized that SARS-CoV-2-infected cells such as airway epithelial cells secrete EVs carrying
viral genetic material that may be taken up by cardiomyocytes and establish an indirect route of
SARS-CoV-2 genetic material transmission.
RESULTS AND DISCUSSION
To test whether the viral RNA of SARS-CoV-2 can be transmitted via EVs into cardiomyocytes
without the need for direct infection, we transduced A549 lung epithelial cells with lentivirus
encoding selected SARS-CoV-2 proteins8 (Figure 1A). A549 cells were chosen as a model cell
type since COVID-19 appears to mainly infect respiratory tract cells in patients. SARS-CoV-2
genes encoding for two non-structural proteins (Nsp1 and Nsp12) and two structural proteins
(envelope E and nucleocapsid N) were used for this proof-of-principle study. We opted not to
include the spike (S) protein, which is required for receptor binding and viral entry, in order to
focus on EV-mediated transfer of viral fragments into recipient cardiomyocytes that is independent
of S-protein mediated direct viral entry. The use of lentivirus overexpressing viral subunits also
allowed us to distinguish EV-mediated SARS-CoV-2 RNA transfer from canonical virus infection
since EV preparations inevitably contain infectious virions due to the overlap in size.
Quantitative RT-PCR on total RNA extracted from A549 cells 48 hours after lentivirus
transduction confirmed the successful overexpression of viral RNAs encoding for Nsp1, Nsp12,

E and N respectively compared to a control empty vector (Figure 1B). To isolate EVs released
by A549 cells, the supernatant of A549 cells grown in culture medium supplemented with
exosome-depleted FBS for 48 hours was collected for EV purification. Immunoblotting of EV
preparations confirmed the enrichment of the EV markers CD63, CD81 and TSG101 although we
did note the presence of albumin most likely due to the PEG-based isolation method used (Figure
1C). In addition, there was no significant difference between control and viral proteins
overexpressing A549 cells in terms of EVs production with an average of 100 μg of EVs being
secreted over a period of 48 hours by 1 x 107 cells (data not shown).
We next asked whether the RNAs encoding for SARS-CoV-2 are packaged into purified
EVs of A549 cells. qRT-PCR revealed the presence of mRNA in purified EVs for each of the four
tested SARS-CoV-2 genes (Figure 1D). We performed a separate validation for Nsp1 and Nsp12
in EVs isolated using a different method based on immuno-magnetic CD63-beads and
successfully confirmed the presence of both tested genes in the isolated EVs (Figure S1). To
further substantiate the presence of viral genes within EVs, we treated our Nsp1 EV preparation
with RNase/protease. As expected, treatment with RNase alone or protease + RNase led to
minimal loss of Nsp1, while addition of detergent led to significant degradation of the enclosed
Nsp1 (Figure S2). To study if human cardiomyocytes are able to uptake EVs, we labeled EVs
with a fluorescent dye ExoGlow, and incubated them (100 μg) with human induced pluripotent
stem cells-derived cardiomyocytes (hiPSC-CMs, 1 x 106 cells). Following 6 hours of 37°C
incubation and washout of unbound EVs, we observed the presence of labeled EVs in treated
hiPSC-CMs, which was not observed when the cells were incubated with the negative control
(PBS without EVs stained with ExoGlow), confirming the successful binding/uptake of EVs by the
recipient hiPSC-CMs (Figure 1E and Figure S3). Moreover, after exposure of hiPSC-CMs to
A549 EVs for 24 hours, we detected all four tested viral RNAs in the hiPSC-CMs, but we could
not detect any significant levels of viral RNAs in hiPSC-CMs treated with control EVs (Figure 1F).
In a separate set of experiments, we exposed hiPSC-CMs to conditioned media collected from
Nsp1-overexpressing A549 cells (1 x 107 cells) with and without concurrent treatment of GW4869
(5 μM), an inhibitor of exosome generation. The expression of Nsp1 in hiPSC-CMs was
significantly blunted when GW4869 was present, consistent with the involvement of EVs in RNA
transfer (Figure S4). We next assessed whether hiPSC-CM exposure to EVs from A549 cells
expressing viral RNA increased inflammatory gene expression. It is known that, A549 EVs
themselves can increase inflammation9. We noted that EVs containing Nsp1 further increased the
expression of the pro-inflammatory genes IL1β and IL6, suggesting the transferred viral gene may
promote inflammation (Figure 1G).

There are several limitations in our study. Although the precipitation method used in our
study for isolating EVs leads to high recovery, it is associated with recovery of non-EV
components such as proteins. However, our additional experiments including immuno-magnetic
isolation of EVs, RNase/protease treatment and GW4869 treatment support the enrichment of
viral genes within EVs. The ExoGlow dye used cannot fully distinguish among binding and
internalization of EVs. It should also be noted that the viral genes used in our study are codonoptimized and expressed at a supraphysiological level. Further experiments are needed to
validate if EVs are capable of transferring actual viral RNAs or virions at a physiological level, and
if the transferred RNAs are biologically active. Overall, our results collectively demonstrated that
lung epithelial cells expressing SARS-CoV-2 genes can secrete EVs containing viral RNA
fragments that can be detected in cardiomyocytes suggesting an indirect route of viral RNA
delivery into cardiac cells via EVs. Transfer of viral RNA via EVs should be considered when
studying the widespread multi-organ effects of a SARS-CoV-2 infection that has been reported10,
because it indicates that cells which do not express the SARS-CoV-2 receptor ACE2 might still
be vulnerable via the uptake of EVs. Further work is needed to clarify whether the entry of SARSCoV-2 RNA via EVs is sufficient to induce cell injury and inflammation.
METHODS
Cell Culture
HEK293T cells were purchased from TakaraBio and cultured in Dulbecco’s modified Eagle’s
medium (DMEM) with high glucose (Thermo Fisher, 11995-065) supplemented with 10% serum.
A549 cells were purchased from ATCC and cultured in Ham’s F-12K medium (Thermo Fisher,
21127022). Human induced pluripotent stem cells-derived cardiomyocytes (hiPSC-CMs) were
differentiated using a chemically defined monolayer differentiation protocol as previously
described11. Briefly, iPSCs at 90% confluence were incubated with differentiation basal medium
comprising RPMI 1640 medium (Thermo Fisher, 11875095) and B27 supplement minus insulin
(Thermo Fisher, A1895601). CHIR99021 (8 μM) was added to the differentiation basal medium.
On day 2, medium was removed and replaced with differentiation basal medium minus
CHIR99021. On day 3, the Wnt antagonist, IWR-1, was added to the medium. After 48 hours,
medium was removed and replaced with differentiation basal medium without any inhibitors. On
day 7, the cells were incubated with complete CM medium consisting of RPMI 1640 medium and
B27 supplement plus insulin (Thermo Fisher, 17504044). The medium was changed every 2 days.
Monolayers of hiPSC-CMs were cultured for 30 days and subsequently dissociated for
experimental use using TrypLE Express (Life Technologies). For measurement of inflammatory

genes, hiPSC-CMs were exposed to either TNF-α (50 ng/mL) or EVs (control vs Nsp1) for 6 hours
prior to RNA extraction. All procedures conformed to the UIC institutional review board-approved
protocol.
Production of lentivirus expressing SARS-CoV-2 subunits
Plasmids encoding for codon-optimized Nsp1, Nsp12, E and N of SARS-CoV-2 with a 2xStrep
tag at the C-terminus were kindly provided by Dr. Nevan Krogan8. Empty vector or respective
overexpression plasmids were packaged into virus using HEK293T cells as the packaging cell
line in 10 cm dishes. Target DNA, helper plasmids VSVG and PAX2 were transfected at 9, 3 and
9 μg respectively using Lipofectamine 2000 (Thermo Fisher, 11668027). Infectious supernatant
was collected at 48 and 72 hours after transfection and filtered to remove cell debris. Supernatant
was then concentrated using Lenti-X Concentrator (TakaraBio, 631232) according to the
manufacturer’s protocol. A549 cells were then transduced with either control or overexpression
lentivirus with polybrene (8 µg/ml) overnight, and fresh medium supplemented with exosomedepleted FBS (Thermo Fisher, A2720803) was added and incubated for 48 hours before being
collected for EV isolation.
RNA extraction and quantitative real-time reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction
(qRT-PCR)
Total RNA was isolated using Direct-Zol RNA Miniprep Kit (Zymo Research, R2051). Reverse
transcription was performed using the High-Capacity cDNA Reverse Transcription Kit with RNase
Inhibitor (Thermo Fisher, 4374966) and qRT-PCR was performed using the PowerUp SYBR
Green Master Mix (Thermo Fisher, A25742) on a QuantStudio 7 Flex real-time PCR detector
(Thermo Fisher). Relative mRNA levels were normalized to those of GAPDH mRNA in each
reaction and undetermined raw Ct values were set to 40 for analysis purposes. Primers
sequences are shown in Table 1. Three to four replicates per group were used for qRT-PCR.
Protein extraction and western blot analysis
EV samples were prepared in 1x RIPA buffer (Sigma, R0278) supplemented with protease and
phosphatase inhibitor (Thermo Fisher, 78440). Samples were subjected to electrophoresis on 412% NuPAGE Bis–Tris gels (Thermo Fisher, NP0335BOX) and proteins were transferred to
nitrocellulose membranes using wet-based transfer system (Bio-Rad). Membranes were
incubated overnight with the indicated primary antibodies, followed by incubation for 1 hour with
horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibodies (Cell Signaling; 7074 and 7076).

Signals were detected by chemiluminescence. Primary antibodies used include CD63 (Thermo
Fisher, 10628D), CD81 (Thermo Fisher, 10630D), TSG101 (Thermo Fisher, MA123296), calnexin
(Thermo Fisher, MA3027) and albumin (Proteintech, 16475-1-AP).
Isolation of extracellular vesicles
Supernatant of A549 cells was collected at 48 hours after transduction with lentivirus for isolation
of EVs. Briefly, supernatant was first centrifuged at 300 x g for 5 minutes, followed by 1500 x g
for 10 minutes, filtered (0.2 μM) and concentrated using Ultracel-100K (Millipore). EVs in
concentrate were then isolated using Total Exosome Isolation Reagent (Thermo Fisher, 4478359)
according to the manufacturer’s instructions overnight at 4°C, followed by centrifugation at 12 000
x g at 4°C for 1 hour. Isolated EVs were immunoblotted for EV markers CD63 and CD81. For
immuno-magnetic isolation of CD63-positive EVs, the exosome-human CD63 isolation/detection
reagent (Thermo Fisher, 10606D) was used based on the manufacturer’s protocol. EVs were preenriched using the Total Exosome Isolation Reagent as described above. For GW4869 (Sigma,
D1692) experiments, supernatant was concentrated 100 times using Ultracel-100K following
treatment of A549 cells for 48 hours with and without GW4869 (5 μM) before being added to
hiPSC-CMs (1 x 106 cells seeded in 1 mL media).
RNase/protease treatment of EVs
An exosomal preparation was divided into four equal fractions for the following treatments: i)
untreated; ii) RNase only, iii) RNase with proteinase K and iv) RNase, proteinase K and Triton X100. First, 1% Triton X-100 or an equivalent volume of PBS was added and incubated on ice for
15 minutes. This was followed by the addition of proteinase K (0.05 μg/μl) at 37°C for 20 minutes,
after which the reaction was stopped by adding 1x protease/phosphatase inhibitor cocktail. Finally,
RNase A (0.5 μg/μl) is added at 37°C for 20 minutes. Samples were then immediately subjected
to RNA isolation and qRT-PCR.
Uptake of EVs by hiPSC-CMs
Purified EVs were labeled using the ExoGlowTM-Protein EV Labeling Kit (System Bio,
EXOGP400A-1) which labels internal EV proteins based on the manufacturer’s description. Briefly,
150 μg of EVs were resuspended in 500 μl of PBS and incubated with 1 μl of ExoGlow dye with
shaking at 37°C for 20 minutes. For negative control staining, 500 ul of PBS + 1 µl of ExoGlow
dye was used. Unincorporated dye was removed by the use of Exosome Spin Columns (Thermo
Fisher, 4484449). Labeled EVs were then precipitated overnight as described above and added

to hiPSC-CMs for 6 hours at 37ºC. hiPSC-CMs were then fixed and stained with cardiac troponin
T (Abcam, AB45932) and imaged by confocal microscopy to visualize uptake of labeled EVs.
Statistics
The values presented are the means ± standard deviation from at least three samples. Statistical
differences were determined by a 2-tailed, unpaired Student t-test or two-way ANOVA with
Tukey’s multiple comparison test as appropriate. A value of P<0.05 was considered significant.

Supplemental Figure 1. SARS-CoV-2 synthetic genes (Nsp1 and Nsp12) were detected in EVs
released from A549 lung epithelial cells. EVs were isolated using immuno-magnetic anti-CD63
beads as an additional verification method. mRNA levels were measured by qRT-PCR (n = 3,
mean ± S.D.). ***P<0.001 versus pLVX-Blank (Student’s t-test).
Supplemental Figure 2. RNase A and Proteinase K sensitivity of Nsp1 within EVs. Nsp1 EVs
were purified from A549 cell culture media and treated with either RNase A alone, RNase A and
Proteinase K, or RNase A and Proteinase K in the presence of detergent. mRNA levels were
measured by qRT-PCR (n = 3, mean ± S.D.). *P<0.05 versus untreated EVs (Student’s t-test).
Supplemental Figure 3. Visualization of ExoGlow-labeled exosomes (red) added to hiPSC-CMs
which were stained with cardiac troponin T (green) by confocal imaging. Orthogonal planes (xy,
yz and xz) of the confocal microscope images are depicted on the right. Scale bar = 10 μM.
Supplemental Figure 4. hiPSC-CMs were exposed to conditioned media collected from Nsp1overexpressing A549 cells treated with or without GW4869 (5 μM). mRNA levels were measured
by qRT-PCR (n = 3, mean ± S.D.). ***P<0.001 versus untreated (Student’s t-test).
