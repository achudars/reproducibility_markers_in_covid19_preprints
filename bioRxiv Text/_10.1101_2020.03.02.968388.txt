ABSTRACT

Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 is rapidly spreading around the world. There is
no existing vaccine or proven drug to prevent infections and stop virus proliferation. Although this
virus is similar to human and animal SARS- and MERS-CoVs the detailed information about SARSCoV-2 proteins structures and functions is urgently needed to rapidly develop effective vaccines,
antibodies and antivirals. We applied high-throughput protein production and structure determination
pipeline at the Center for Structural Genomics of Infectious Diseases to produce SARS-CoV-2
proteins and structures. Here we report the high-resolution crystal structure of endoribonuclease
Nsp15/NendoU from SARS-CoV-2 – a virus causing current world-wide epidemics. We compare
this structure with previously reported models of Nsp15 from SARS and MERS coronaviruses.

Introduction
Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is an etiologic agent
responsible for the current outbreak of Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19). Over the past two
months, the pathogen has infected over 88,000 people and caused at least 3,000 deaths. As we were
preparing this report the numbers have doubled. Although currently mainly concentrated in China,
the virus is spreading worldwide rapidly and is found in 64 countries and all continents
(www.trackcorona.live). Millions of people are being quarantined and the epidemics impacts the
world economy. There is no existing vaccine or proven drug for this disease, but various treatment
options, for example utilizing medicines effective in other viral ailments, are being attempted.
Coronaviruses are enveloped, non-segmented positive-sense RNA viruses from the order
nidoviruses that have the largest genome among RNA viruses. The genome contains a large replicase
gene encompassing nonstructural proteins (Nsps), followed by structural and accessory genes. Due
to ribosomal frameshifting, the replicase gene encodes two ORFs, rep1a and rep1b, that are translated
into two large polyproteins, pp1a and pp1ab (Cui et al., 2019). These polypeptides are processed by
two viral proteases: 3C-like protease (3CLpro, encoded by Nsp5), and papain-like protease (PLP,
encoded within Nsp3). The cleavage yields 16 viral Nsps (Baez-Santos et al., 2015) that assemble
into a large membrane-bound replicase complex and exhibits multiple enzymatic activities. While
several functions of Nsps have been linked to RNA replication and processing of subgenomic RNAs,
the roles of some proteins are poorly understood or remain unknown.
One of such enigmatic enzymes, corresponding to Nsp15, is a nidoviral RNA uridylate-specific
endoribonuclease (NendoU) carrying C-terminal catalytic domain belonging to the EndoU family.
EndoU enzymes are present in all kingdoms of life, where they play various biological functions
associated with RNA processing. All characterized family members display an RNA endonuclease
activity producing 2’-3’ cyclic phosphodiester and 5´-hydroxyl termini (Ulferts & Ziebuhr, 2011).
The viral and eukaryotic enzymes act on both, single- and double stranded RNA and are specific for
uridine. The prototypic member of the family was discovered in Xenopus laevis, and thus named
XendoU, where it is associated with maturation of intron-encoded small nucleolar RNAs (snoRNA)
(Caffarelli et al., 1994, Caffarelli et al., 1997, Gioia et al., 2005, Laneve et al., 2003). The human
homolog, placental protein 11 (PP11, HendoU) plays yet an unknown role in the placental tissue
(Laneve et al., 2008), but is also expressed in cancer cells. In Drosophila, DendoU has been found to
be relevant for nervous system physiology and pathology (Laneve et al., 2017). The EndoU

representatives are also present in prokaryotes, with the best characterized enzyme lacking uridylate
specificity of the family and acting as a tRNAse toxin in bacterial communication (Michalska et al.,
2018).
In viruses, the NendoU protein is conserved among coronaviruses, arteriviruses and toroviruses,
but is absent in non-vertebrate - infecting representatives of the nidoviruses order: mesoniviruses and
roniviruses. While initially Nsp15 was thought to directly participate in viral replication, it was later
shown that Nsp15-deficient coronaviruses were viable and replicating, rising doubts about the
enzyme role in that process. More recently, it was proposed that NendoU activity of Nsp15 is
responsible for the protein interference with the innate immune response (Deng et al., 2017) though
other studies indicate that the process is independent of the endonuclease activity (Liu et al., 2019).
Nevertheless, Nsp15 is essential in coronavirus biology.
Nsp15s from coronaviruses share little sequence similarity with their arteriviruses counterpart
Nsp11: the SARS-CoV Nsp15 has only 22% identical residues with Porcine Reproductive and
Respiratory Syndrome virus (PRRSV) Nsp11. Within arteriviruses alone sequence conservation of
Nsp11 is generally low, while Nsp15 of coronaviruses are more conserved, with the current SARSCoV-2 sharing 88% sequence identity and 95% similarity with its known closest homolog from
SARS-CoV. Nsp15 from Middle East Respiratory Syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) is more
distant, with ~50% sequence identity and ~65% similarity and H-CoV-229E being even more distant
with 43% sequence identity and 56% similarity.
After the 2002-2003 SARS outbreak there was an increased interest in virus-encoded
endoribonucleases. The first two structures of Nsp15 were determined from Mouse Hepatitis Virus
(MHV) (PDB id 2GTH, 2GTI (Xu et al., 2006)) and SARS coronavirus (PDB id 2H85, (Ricagno et
al., 2006). Currently, there are in total eight structures available for Nsp15 including additional two
from SARS-CoV (PDB ids: 2OZK, 2RHB, (Joseph et al., 2007)), one from MERS-CoV (PDB id
5YVD, (Zhang et al., 2018)) and two from human coronavirus H-CoV-229E (PDB ids 4S1T, 4RS4,
(Huo & Liu, 2015)). Among Nsp11 endoribonucleases, there are two structures determined of
PRRSV (Porcine Reproductive and Respiratory Syndrome Virus) (PDB ids 5EYI, 5DA1, (Zhang et
al., 2017)), and two for EAV (Equine Arteritis Virus, PDB ids 5HC1, 5HBZ, (Zhang et al., 2017)).
The structural studies of SARS- and MERS-CoV Nsp15s showed that the protein forms hexamers
made of dimers of trimers. The 39 kDa monomeric unit, composed of ~345 residues, folds into three
domains: N-terminal, middle domain and C-terminal catalytic NendoU domain.

Rapid upsurge and proliferation of SARS-CoV-2 raised questions about how this virus could
became so much more transmissible as compared to the SARS and MERS coronaviruses. The
proteins of the coronavirus are mutating, although not very fast, but these changes may contribute to
the virus virulence. Here, we report the first crystal structure of SARS-CoV-2 Nsp15 at 2.20 Å
resolution. The Nsp15 structure is very similar to the SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV but it shows some
differences that may contribute to SARS-CoV-2 virulence.
Results and Discussion

Protein production and structure determination
We have used synthetic gene of SARS-CoV-2 coronavirus nsp15, which was codon optimized
for expression in E. coli, to produce soluble protein. Nsp15 was purified and crystallized exercising
the well-established structural genomics pipeline. The structure was determined by molecular
replacement and refined to 2.20 Å resolution, as described in Materials and Methods and Table 1.
The entire process from protein expression to structure deposition to PDB took 5 days.
The structure of SARS-CoV-2 coronavirus Nsp15 is of good quality and it refined to
crystallographic Rwork of 15.8% and Rfree of 17.8%. The asymmetric unit contains two monomers of
the Nsp15 protein. The electron density map is of high quality throughout the structure and the model
covers the sequence from M1 to Q347. Currently, this is the most complete and the highest resolution
structure of coronavirus Nsp15. 346 water molecules, eight glycerol molecules, three acetate ions,
one magnesium and one chloride ion were identified in the electron density maps.

Overall structure
The structure of SARS-CoV-2 Nsp15 monomer is very similar to other Nsp15s from
coronaviruses (Fig. 1 and 2). It features three distinct domains. The N-terminal domain is composed
of an antiparallel b-sheet (strands b1, b2, and b3) wrapped around two a-helices (a1 and a2). The
subsequent middle domain is formed by 10 b-strands organized in three b-hairpins (b5-b6, b7-b8,
b12-b13), a mixed b-sheet (b4, b9, b10, b11, b14, b15) and three short helices, two a and one 310
(a3, h4, and a5). The C-terminal catalytic NendoU domain contains two antiparallel b-sheets (b16-

b17-b18, b19-b20-b21) with their edges hosting a catalytic site. b18, even though is broken in the
secondary structure annotation, is treated here as a single element. The concave surface of the bsheets is flanked by five a-helices (a6, a7, a8, a9, a10).
As expected from high sequence identity (Fig. 3), the structure aligns best with SARS-CoV Nsp15
(0.47 Å RMSD of chain A with PDB id: 2H85, chain A; sequence identity 88%), and also shows
good agreement with Nsp15 from MERS-CoV (1.17 Å RMSD of chain A with PDB id 5YVD, chain
A; sequence identity 51%). The structural homology is not only observed in positions of a-helices
and b-strands but surprisingly in several loop regions (for example the conformation of loop L1 (F16
– P24) is virtually identical in all three proteins). But there are some interesting differences between
SARS- and MERS-CoVs proteins in loop regions (b8-b9, b10-b11) with the largest (more than 5 Å)
centering on the loop between strand b13 and b14 where MERS-CoV Nsp15 has three-residues
insertion. These relatively small changes in the subunit structures translate into larger shifts in the
hexamer (see below).
The SARS-CoV-2 NendoU monomers assemble into a double-ring hexamer, generated by a
dimer of trimers (Fig. 4). This is in agreement with PISA calculations, estimating trimers to be a
stable form of the enzyme, and the previous experimental work capturing SARS-CoV Nsp15 trimeric
intermediates (Guarino et al., 2005). It has been shown that hexamer is essential for the enzymatic
activity. A ~100 Å long and narrow (10-15 Å diameter) channel runs down the 3-fold axis. This
channel is accessible to solvent from the top, bottom and also through three side openings in the
middle of hexamer. The hexamer is stabilized by the interactions of N-terminal oligomerization
domains, but also each subunit domain contributes to oligomer interface. As a result, monomers
interact extensively with all five other subunits of the hexamer, making the hexamer potentially very
sensitive to mutations that can disrupt oligomeric assembly (Fig. 4). The middle domains are the most
transposed out in the hexamer creating the concave surfaces that may serve as an interaction hubs.
The SARS-CoV-2 NendoU oligomer resembles those of SARS-CoV, H-CoV-229E and MERSCoV enzymes. As with the monomeric folds, the SARS-CoV-2 hexamer shows higher similarity to
the SARS-CoV assembly than to H-CoV-229E and MERS-CoV. The largest difference between
SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV seems to occur in the position of middle domains. The differences
with H-CoV-229E are still more significant and show shifts in positions of a-helices, b-sheets and
loops. Similarly, MERS-CoV enzyme show significant structural changes, particularly in the loops

of the middle domain. This suggests that the SARS-CoV-2 enzyme operates most likely a manner
very similar to SARS-CoV, H-CoV-229E and MERS CoV homologs, though it still may display
different catalytic properties and potentially altered substrate specificity.

NendoU active site
Recombinant Nsp15s were shown to have Mn+2-dependent endoribonuclease activity that cut
double-stranded (ds) RNA substrates with specificity towards uridylate in unpaired regions
(Bhardwaj et al., 2004, Bhardwaj et al., 2008, Bhardwaj et al., 2006, Ivanov et al., 2004). While the
early work suggested cleavage upstream and downstream of U (Bhardwaj et al., 2004, Ivanov et al.,
2004), the 2006 more detailed study demonstrated the reaction occurs on the 3’ end of U (Bhardwaj
et al., 2006). The enzyme carries out transesterification reaction releasing 2’-3’cyclic phosphate end
(Ivanov et al., 2004), as has been demonstrated for other members of EndoU family (Nedialkova et
al., 2009, Renzi et al., 2006), though some studies report subsequent hydrolysis of the cyclic
compound (Nedialkova et al., 2009).
The catalytic function of Nsp15 resides in the C-terminal NendoU domain. The active site, located
in a shallow groove between the two b-sheets, carries six key residues conserved among SARS-CoV2, SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV proteins: His235, His250, Lys290, Thr341, Tyr343, and Ser294 (Fig.
5). The main chain architecture of this region as well as side chain conformations of the active site
residues (with exception of Lys290) are conserved between all three proteins. The two histidine
residues are contributed by the helical layer of the domain, while pairs lysine/serine and
threonine/tyrosine originate from two b-strands representing edges of the b-sheets. His235, His250,
Lys290 have been proposed to constitute the catalytic triad, based on the similarity of their mutual
arrangement to the active site of ribonuclease A (Ricagno et al., 2006). In this scenario, His235 plays
a role of the general acid while His250 acts a base. By the same reasoning, Ser294 together with
Tyr343 are believed to govern U specificity, resembling the roles of Phe120 and Thr45 (the B1 subsite
specific for pyrimidine base) in RNAse A in base recognition (delCardayre & Raines, 1994).
Specifically, Ser294 analogs have been proposed to interact with the carbonyl oxygen atom O2 of
uracil via the main chain nitrogen atom, while the hydroxyl group would bind to the nitrogen atom
((Bhardwaj et al., 2004, Bhardwaj et al., 2008, Bhardwaj et al., 2006, Ivanov et al., 2004). Notably
though, not all mutational data support the hypothesis of the discriminatory role of Ser and, as an

alternative, Thr341 has been also considered (Ricagno et al., 2006).
The Mn+2 dependence has been observed for most EndoU members, but for example Nsp11 does
not show such behavior (Nedialkova et al., 2009), and appears to be a common feature of NendoU
subfamily. However, the metal binding site was never located, though it is important to note that there
is no structure of the protein/RNA complex. In our structure, there are two subunits in the asymmetric
unit. One of them has an electron density peak near the active site that may correspond to metal ion
and we tentatively modeled it as a magnesium ion, although the coordination sphere is poor. The
metal ion is coordinated by oxygen atom of carboxylate Asp283 (2.61 Å), hydroxyl group of Ser262
(2.08 Å) and main chain carbonyl oxygen atom of Pro263 (2.28 Å). Nearby, there is a side chain of
Arg258. If this would be a manganese ion, this arginine could coordinate the metal ion using nitrogen
of guanidinium moiety (distance to magnesium ion is 4.1 Å). These residues are conserved in SARS
but not in MERS enzymes. We propose that this is the metal binding site required for maintaining
conformation of the active site and substrate during catalysis.
In the hexameric context, the active sites are located on the top and bottom of the assembly.
NendoU binds single and double stranded RNA and large substrate can access these six sites from a
site of the hexamer. All six sites can be occupied simultaneously. Due to extensive interactions
between protein subunits, there is possibility for cooperativity or anti-cooperativity between binding
sites. By analogy to SARS-CoV Nsp15 and SARS-CoV-2 Nsp15, the hexamer most likely represents
an active form of the enzyme.

Conclusions
We have determined the high-resolution crystal structure of endoribonuclease NendoU from
SARS-CoV-2. The structure is homologous to SARS- and MERS-CoVs Nsp15s and shows a
hexamer, the functionally active form of the endoribonuclease. The active site residues are conserved
both in terms of sequence and conformation. The structural comparisons suggest that inhibitors of
SARS-CoV Nsp15 have good chance to inhibit also the SARS-CoV-2 homolog but inhibitors of
MERS-CoV NendoU are unlikely to inhibit the enzyme.

Materials and methods

Gene cloning, protein expression and purification
The gene cloning, protein expression and purification were performed as reported previously
(Makowska-Grzyska et al., 2014). Briefly, the gene for Nsp15 SARS-CoV-2 was optimized for E.
coli expression using the OptimumGene codon optimization algorithm followed by manual editing
and then synthesized cloned directly into pMCSG53 vector (Twist Bioscience). The plasmid was
transformed into the E. coli BL21(DE3)-Gold strain (Stratagene). For large-scale purification of the
protein, a 4 L culture of LB Lennox medium was grown at 37°C (190 rpm) in presence of ampicillin
150 µg/ml. Once the culture reached OD600 ~1.0, the temperature setting was changed to 4°C. When
bacterial suspension cooled down to 18°C it was supplemented with the following components to
indicated concentration: 0.2 mM IPTG, 0.1% glucose, 40mM K2HPO4. The temperature was set to
18°C for 20 hours incubation. Bacterial cells were harvested by centrifugation at 7,000g and cell
pellets were resuspended in a 12.5 ml lysis buffer (500 mM NaCl, 5% (v/v) glycerol, 50 mM HEPES
pH 8.0, 20 mM imidazole and 10 mM β-mercaptoethanol) per liter culture and sonicated at 120W for
5 minutes (4 sec ON, 20 sec OFF). The cellular debris was removed by centrifugation at 30,000g for
one hour at 4°C. Supernatant was mixed with 4 ml of Ni2+ Sepharose (GE Healthcare Life Sciences)
equilibrated with lysis buffer supplemented to 50 mM imidazole pH 8.0 and suspension was applied
on Flex-Column (420400-2510) connected to Vac-Man vacuum manifold (Promega). Unbound
proteins were washed out via controlled suction with 160 ml of lysis buffer (50 mM imidazole).
Bound proteins were eluted with 20 ml of lysis buffer supplemented to 500 mM imidazole pH 8.0. 2
mM DTT was added followed by Tobacco Etch Virus (TEV) protease treatment at 1:20
protease:protein ratio. The solution was left at 4°C overnight. Unfortunately, for this particular
construct, TEV protease was not able to cleave off the His tag. Nsp15 was successfully separated
from TEV protease on Superdex 200 column equilibrated in lysis buffer where 10 mM βmercaptoethanol was replaced by 1 mM TCEP. Fractions containing Nsp15 were collected. Lysis
buffer was replaced on 30 kDa MWCO filter (Amicon-Millipore) via 10X concentration/dilution
repeated 3 times to crystallization buffer (150 mM NaCl, 20 mM HEPES pH 7.5, 1 mM TCEP). Final
concentration of Nsp15 was 36 mg/ml.

Crystallization
Crystallization experiments also were conducted as described previously, with slight
modifications. The sitting-drop vapor-diffusion method was used with the help of the Mosquito liquid
dispenser (TTP LabTech) in 96-well CrystalQuick plates (Greiner Bio-One). Crystallizations were
performed with the protein-to-matrix ratio of 1:1. MCSG4 (Anatrace), SaltRX (Hampton) and
INDEX (Hampton) screens were used for protein crystallization at 16°C. The best conditions were
MCSG4 H11 (0.2 M calcium acetate, 0.1 M HEPES/NaOH pH 7.5, 10% PEG 8000). Diffractionquality crystals of Nsp15 suitable for data collection appeared after 12 hours.

Data collection, structure determination and refinement
Prior to data collection at 100 K, all cryoprotected crystals of Nsp15 were flash-cooled in liquid
nitrogen. The x-ray diffraction experiments were carried out at the Structural Biology Center 19-ID
beamline at the Advanced Photon Source, Argonne National Laboratory. The diffraction images were
recorded on the PILATUS3 6M detector K using 0.5° rotation and 0.5 sec exposure for 100°. The
data set was processed and scaled with the HKL3000 suite (Minor et al., 2006). Intensities were
converted to structure factor amplitudes in the Ctruncate program (French & Wilson, 1978, Padilla
& Yeates, 2003) from the CCP4 package (Winn et al., 2011). The structure was determined using
molrep (Vagin & Teplyakov, 2010) implemented in the HKL3000 software package and SARS-CoV
Nsp15 structure (PDB id 2H85) as a search model. The initial solution was manually adjusted using
COOT (Emsley & Cowtan, 2004) and then iteratively refined using COOT, PHENIX (Adams et al.,
2010) and REFMAC (Murshudov et al., 1997, Winn et al., 2011). Initially REFMAC refinement
worked better for the structure which was subsequently moved to PHENIX to finalize the refinement.
Throughout the refinement, the same 5% of reflections were kept out throughout from the refinement
(in both REFMAC and PHENIX refinement). The final structure converged to a good Rwork = 0.158
and Rfree = 0.178 with regards to data quality. The stereochemistry of the structure was checked with
PROCHECK (Laskowski et al., 1993) and the Ramachandran plot and validated with the PDB
validation server. The data collection and processing statistics are given in Table 1. The atomic
coordinates and structure factors have been deposited in the Protein Data Bank under accession code
6VWW. As we were preparing this report we have determined and deposited to PDB higher
resolution 1.90 Å structure of the SARS-CoV-2 Nsp15 in complex with citrate (PDB id 6W01). This
