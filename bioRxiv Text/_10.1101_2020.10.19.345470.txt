Abstract
The outbreak of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) has developed
into an unprecedented global pandemic. Nucleoside analogues, such as Remdesivir and
Favipiravir, can serve as the first-line broad-spectrum antiviral drugs against the newly
emerging viral diseases. Recent clinical trials of these two drugs for SARS-CoV-2 treatment
revealed antiviral efficacies as well as side effects with different extents1-4. As a pyrazine
derivative, Favipiravir could be incorporated into the viral RNA products by mimicking both
adenine and guanine nucleotides, which may further lead to mutations in progeny RNA copies
due to the non-conserved base-pairing capacity5. Here, we determined the cryo-EM structure
of Favipiravir bound to the replicating polymerase complex of SARS-CoV-2 in the pre-catalytic
state. This structure provides a missing snapshot for visualizing the catalysis dynamics of
coronavirus polymerase, and reveals an unexpected base-pairing pattern between Favipiravir
and pyrimidine residues which may explain its capacity for mimicking both adenine and
guanine nucleotides. These findings shed lights on the mechanism of coronavirus polymerase
catalysis and provide a rational basis for developing antiviral drugs to combat the SARS-CoV2 pandemic.

Main
Coronaviridae family includes many life-threatening human pathogens, such as SARS-CoV6,
Middle East Respiratory Syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV)7 and the ongoing pandemic
SARS-CoV-28,9. Coronaviruses harbor a non-segmented positive-sense RNA genome with 5’cap and 3’-polyA tail, which can directly serve as mRNA to guide the production of viral

proteins10. A total of 4 structural proteins and at least 16 non-structural proteins (nsps) as well
as 8 accessory proteins are encoded by the coronavirus genome. Among them, nsp12 is the core
catalytic subunit of viral RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp) complex, which executes
transcription and replication of the viral genomic RNA11. Two cofactor subunits, nsp7 and nsp8,
associate with nsp12 to constitute an obligatory core polymerase complex to confer processivity
for RNA elongation12. To achieve complete transcription and replication, a panel of other nsps
are involved to accomplish other enzymatic functions, including the nsp14-nsp10 exonuclease
for proofreading13-15, the nsp13 helicase for RNA unwinding16-19, the nsp14 N7methyltransferase and the nsp16-nsp10 2’-O-methyltransferase for capping20-24. Due to the key
roles of polymerase complex for viral replication, it has long been thought of as a promising
antiviral drug target25. Recently, we and other groups have determined the structures of SARSCoV-2 core polymerase complex in both apo and RNA-bound states26-30, providing important
information for structure-based antiviral drug design.
In the efforts to combat SARS-CoV-2 pandemic, Remdesivir was initially expected as a
highly competent drug candidate for disease treatment. However, the recently disclosed
outcome of clinical trials revealed controversial efficacies as well as some cases of side
effects1,2. The clinical improvement rate of patients receiving Remdesivir within 7 days was
only 3% and ~66% subjects developed adverse effects1,2. In contrast, another broad-spectrum
antiviral Favipiravir showed good promise that 61.21% patients were clinically recovered at
day 7 of treatment and 31.90% subjects were reported with side effect manifestations 3,4. Both
of them are administered as pro-drugs and should be processed into triphosphate forms as
nucleotide mimicries to interfere with RNA synthesis. The active form of Remdesivir has a

similar base moiety to adenine nucleotide which can be incorporated into the growing strand of
RNA product using an uracil nucleotide as the template30. Besides, the cyanogroup in the ribose
ring may cause steric clash with polymerase residues during elongation, resulting in aberrant
termination of RNA synthesis29,31. It is yet unclear how Favipiravir could be recognized by the
polymerase and disturb the faithful process of RNA production.
To investigate the mechanism for the antiviral efficacy of Favipiravir, we performed in
vitro primer-extension assays using a template derived from the 3’-untranslated region (3’-UTR)
of the authentic viral genome. The +1 catalytic position was inserted with different template
residues accordingly to allow only one nucleotide to be incorporated in the presence of each
individual nucleotide triphosphate (NTP) substrate (Fig. 1). Even though the product strand was
supposed to grow by only one nucleotide, some larger RNA products with two or three
nucleotides extension were generated for each specific NTP substrate (Fig. 1c and d). This
phenomenon suggests the SARS-CoV-2 polymerase is prone to mis-incorporate unwanted
nucleotides into the product RNA, resulting in low fidelity for transferring the genomic
information during transcription and replication. Similar observations were also reported
recently that SARS-CoV-2 polymerase is more tolerant for mismatches between template and
product residues than other viral RdRps5, which further highlights the requirement for the
proofreading nuclease nsp14 to maintain the integrity of viral genome. Interestingly, Favipiravir
could be incorporated into the RNA product with similar efficiencies to those of ATP or GTP
substrates guided by U or C template residues, respectively (Fig. 1c). In contrast, Remdesivir
could only be incorporated with a U in the template strand (Fig. 1d). These evidences
demonstrate that Favipiravir is a universal mimicry for purine nucleotides, different from other

specific nucleotide analogues, such as Remdesivir29,30 and Sofosbuvir32.
Even though Favipiravir could be efficiently incorporated into RNA products to impair the
fidelity of RNA synthesis, it did not significantly inhibit RNA production in vitro (Extended
Data Fig. 1). The presence of Favipiravir in RNA product did not immediately terminate the
extension of growing strand except when repeat pyrimidine residues were encountered in the
template. The RNA synthesis seemed prone to stall if multiple consecutive incorporations of
Favipiravir were supposed to take place (Extended Data Fig. 1b), consistent with the
observations reported by other groups recently5. This evidence suggests that the presence of
repetitive Favipiravir residues might distort the configuration of template-product RNA duplex
to prevent its further extension. However, the consecutive incorporation of Favipiravir might
take place with extremely low probabilities in the cellular environment due to the competition
of ATP/GTP substrates. Thus, Favipiravir is more likely to be discretely incorporated during
virus replication and induce mutations in progeny RNA copies. This hypothesis was supported
by a recently reported virus-based inhibition assay which revealed that Favipiravir was able to
escape the proofreading mechanism of SARS-CoV-2 replication complex and led to mutations
in progeny viral genome5.
To uncover the structural basis of Favipiravir recognition by the polymerase, we
determined the structure of SARS-CoV-2 nsp12-nsp7-nsp8 core polymerase complex in the
presence of a template-product partial duplex RNA and Favipiravir at 3.2 Å global resolution
by cryo-electron microscopy (cryo-EM) reconstruction (Fig. 2; Extended Data Fig. 2). The
density map reveals clear features for most amino acid side chains and nucleotide base moieties,
allowing the detailed analysis for protein-RNA interactions and Favipiravir recognition

(Extended Data Fig. 3). In the structure, the nsp8 subunit (nsp8.1) in the nsp7-nsp8 heterodimer
is mostly unresolved, similar to the recently reported structure of Remdesivir-bound complex
in the pre-translocation conformation30 (Fig. 2a). Besides, the N-terminal long helices of nsp8
subunits could not be visualized as well, which are supposed to form a sliding platform for
template-product duplex elongation27,29. This might result from the insufficient length of the
RNA duplex to establish extensive interactions with the helix track. This structure resolved 18
nucleotide residues in the template strand and 16 residues in the primer strand. Importantly,
Favipiravir was captured in the triphosphate form (FTP) before catalysis which bound at the +1
position and paired with a C template residue (Fig. 2b and c). The α-phosphate of FTP is located
in vicinity of the 3’-hydroxyl group of A-1 residue with a distance of ~3.3 Å and no density for
a phosphate-di-ester bond could be observed (Fig. 2c). Moreover, the density of FTP could only
be visualized at lower contour levels than the other residues, suggesting the lower occupancy
of Favipiravir in the complex, which might be related to the pre-catalytic state without stable
covalent interactions with the product RNA. Thus, this structure provides a missing snapshot
of the pre-catalytic conformation of SARS-CoV-2 polymerase, an earlier stage before the
previously reported post-catalysis/pre-translocation and post-translocation conformations27,29,30.
As a mimicry of nucleotide substrate, FTP is recognized as an incoming NTP by conserved
catalytic residues (Fig. 3a). Residues D623 (motif A) and N691 (motif B) stabilize the ribose
ring of FTP, and residue S682 (motif B) may potentially interact with both the ribose and
pyrazine branch moieties. The A-1 residue of product RNA potentially further contact with the
α-phosphate and ribose of FTP+1 to drag the two residues in close proximity for catalysis. The
amide group of Favipiravir pairs with the template C residue and potentially forms three

hydrogen bonds for base-pairing (Fig. 3a). When paired with a U template residue, there might
be two hydrogen bonds in between (Extended Data Fig. 4). In order to capture the pre-catalytic
conformation, we did not include catalytic metals in the buffers for protein purification and
assembled the complex by incubation on ice to prevent catalysis (Extended Data Fig. 1c). Yet,
we observed the density for a single metal ion anchored by D761 (motif C) of nsp12 which is
offset the catalytic position and may arise from the cellular environment during expression (Fig.
3a). A similar conformation was also observed in the structure of enterovirus 71 (EV71)
polymerase (PDB: 5F8I)33. To enable catalysis, two metal ions are required to neutralize the
negative charges of phosphate groups in NTP substrate and stabilize the transition
intermediate33,34. Based on the previous structure of post-catalytic conformation in the presence
of Remdesivir30, we modeled two magnesium ions into our structure to analyze the potential
catalytic state of this polymerase. The two metal atoms are coordinated by D618 (motif A) and
D761 (motif C) and further bridge the three phosphate groups of FTP substrate. The terminal
γ-phosphate is further sequestered by a salt bridge contributed by K798 (Fig. 3a). Besides,
residues R553 and R555 from motif F may also interact with the β- and γ-phosphate groups.
These interactions together stabilize the incoming nucleotide and 3’-terminus of product RNA
in close vicinity to facilitate the nucleophilic attack to α-phosphate by the 3’-hydroxyl oxygen
of -1 nucleotide.
Since Favipiravir could mimic both adenine and guanine nucleotides for RNA synthesis,
we modeled the GTP into the structure to compare the potential different recognition patterns
for different NTP substrates (Fig. 3). Basically, the GTP reveals a highly similar interaction
network with the polymerase residues to that for FTP except that an additional residue K545

from motif F may also be involved in interactions with the carbonyl group of the guanine base
(Fig. 3b). The ATP substate could also be accommodated similarly with the amino group of
adenine base interacting with K545. For pyrimidine nucleotides, however, the base moiety is
too far away from K545 to form such interactions (Fig. 3d). This residue is highly conserved in
all viral RdRps and may serve as a signature residue for discriminating purine and pyrimidine
substrates (Extended Data Fig. 5). Comparing the RdRps from different viruses, including
positively-/negatively-sensed and segmented/non-segmented RNA viruses, we found the
residues for stabilizing the ribose, base and catalytic metals are highly conserved across all viral
families, whereas the residues for accommodating the phosphate groups reveal obvious
diversity and may also involve residues outside the seven canonical catalytic motifs of RdRp,
e.g. residue R48 in Hepatitis C virus (HCV) polymerase32 (Fig. 3c).
With the available structures of SARS-CoV-2 polymerase before and after catalysis27,29,30,
we were able to assemble a complete scenario of the catalytic cycle to analyze the potential
conformational changes of the polymerase during catalysis (Fig. 4). It has been established in
flavivirus and enterovirus RdRps that the binding of incoming NTP substrates would induce
active site closure and relocation of metal ions to facilitate catalysis32-34. A similar scenario may
also exist for coronavirus polymerase, and potentially other viral RdRps. The motif A loop in
apo polymerase adopts an open conformation with the active site fully accessible for incoming
NTP substrates (Fig. 4a and b). One of the catalytic metal ions (metal A) is anchored by D761
offset the catalytic site, whereas the other one (metal B) might be less stable and frequently
exchange between the polymerase and the solvent. Therefore, the metal A atom could be
visualized in several viral polymerases without the template RNA and NTP substrate in the

active site, including bunyavirus (PDB: 6Z6G)35, and arenavirus (PDB: 6KLC and 6KLD)36
polymerases. With the NTP substrate coming in, the motif A loop flip inward to close the active
site and the side chain of D761 (motif C) rotates to relocate metal A into the catalytic site.
Besides, residue K798 (motif D) would also be re-oriented to stabilize the γ-phosphate of NTP
(Fig. 4c and d). After catalysis, the motif A loop and residue K798 would move back to the
open conformation, allowing the pyrophosphoric acid fragment to be released. This process is
accompanied by the translocation of template-product RNA duplex, which resumes the
polymerase to get ready for the next round of catalysis (Fig. 4e and f).
In summary, we present a missing structural snapshot of coronavirus polymerase
replication in the pre-catalytic conformation, facilitating the extrapolation of the dynamic
catalytic cycle for RNA nucleotide polymerization. Importantly, we reveal the structural basis
of Favipiravir incorporation by SARS-CoV-2, which suggests the feasibility of developing
other nucleotide-mimicking antiviral drugs by utilizing non-base derived molecular entities.
Given the better record of Favipiravir than Remdesivir in side effect manifestations 3,4, it may
represent a better option for clinical treatment of SARS-CoV-2 infections, as well as a panel of
other human-infecting RNA viruses37. In addition, these findings provide an important basis for
developing better broad-spectrum inhibitors with higher potency to combat the infection of
various emerging RNA viruses.

Methods
Protein expression and purification
The SARS-CoV-2 nsp7, nsp8 and nsp7L8 fusion proteins were expressed in E. coli, and the
nsp12 polymerase subunit was expressed with the Bac-to-Bac system (Invitrogen) as previously
described28. All these proteins were purified by tandem affinity chromatography and sizeexclusion chromatography (SEC) accordingly. To constitute the core polymerase complex, the
purified nsp12, nsp8 and nsp7L8 proteins were incubated on ice overnight with a molar ratio
of nsp12:nsp8:nsp7L8=1:3:3. The complex was then purified by SEC using a Superdex 200
increase column (GE Healthcare) equilibrated with a buffer consisting of 25 mM HEPESNaOH (pH 7.5), 300 mM NaCl and 2 mM Tris (2-carboxyethyl) phosphine (TCEP). The
fractions for nsp12-nsp8-nsp7L8 complex were pooled and concentrated to 4 mg/mL for
subsequence experiments.

In vitro polymerase activity assay
The activity of SARS-CoV-2 polymerase complex was tested as previously described28 with
slight modifications. Briefly, 40-nt template RNA strands (sequences adapted for each specific
NTP substrate as shown in Fig. 1) were annealed to a complementary 20-nt primer containing
a 5’-fluorescein label (5’FAM- GUCAUUCUCCUAAGAAGCUA-3’, Takara). To perform the
primer extension assay, 1 μM nsp12, 1 μM nsp7 and 2 μM nsp8 were incubated for 30 min at
30 °C with 1 μM annealed RNA and 0.5 mM individual NTP or drug in a reaction buffer
containing 10 mM Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), 10 mM KCl, 1 mM TCEP and 2 mM MgCl2 (freshly
added prior to usage). The products were denatured by heating to 100 °C for 10 min in the

presence of formamide and resolved by 20% PAGE containing 9 M urea which was run with
0.5×TBE buffer. Images were recorded with a Vilber Fusion imaging system. The RNA
products were quantified by integrating the intensity of each band using ImageJ software. The
significance of difference was estimated by the two-tailed student’s t-test to calculate the P
values for each experimental group.

NaCl, 1 mM TCEP and supplemented with 0.5 mM FTP. An aliquot of 3 μL protein solution
(0.4 mg/mL) was applied to a glow-discharged Quantifiol 1.2/1.3 holey carbon grid and blotted
for 2.5 s in a humidity of 100% before plunge-freezing with an FEI Vitrobot Mark IV. Cryosamples were screened using an FEI Tecnai TF20 electron microscope and transferred to an
FEI Talos Arctica microscope for data collection. The microscope was operated at 200 kV and
equipped with a post-column Bioquantum energy filter (Gatan) which was used with a slit width
of 20 eV. Cryo-EM data was automatically collected using SerialEM software
(http://bio3d.colorado.edu/SerialEM/). Images were recorded with a Gatan K2-summit camera
in super-resolution counting mode with a calibrated pixel size of 1.0 Å at the specimen level.
Each exposure was performed with a dose rate of 10 e-/pixel/s (approximately 10 e-/Å2/s) and

lasted for 6 s, resulting in an accumulative dose of ~60 e-/Å2 which was fractionated into 30
movie-frames. The final defocus range of the dataset was approximately -1.7 to -3.4 μm.

Image processing
The movie frames were aligned using MotionCor2 to correct beam-induced motion and
anisotropic magnification38. Initial contrast transfer function (CTF) values were estimated with
CTFFIND4.139 at the micrograph level. Particles were automatically picked with RELION3.040 following the standard protocol. In total, approximately 2,895,000 particles were picked
from ~5,600 micrographs. After four rounds of 2D classification, ~1,002,000 particles were
selected for 3D classification with the density map of SARS-CoV-2 polymerase replicating
complex (EMDB-11007) low-pass filtered to 60 Å resolution as the reference. After two rounds
of 3D classification, three distinguished 3D classes were identified with clear features of
secondary structural elements. These classes showed different extents of flexibility at the distal
end of RNA duplex but the main body of polymerase complex was highly similar. Therefore,
these 3 classes were combined (including ~329,000 particles) and subjected to 3D refinement
supplemented with per-particle CTF refinement and dose-weighting, which led to a
reconstruction of 3.2 Å resolution estimated by the gold-standard Fourier shell correlation (FSC)
0.143 cut-off value. In the density map, the long helices within the N-terminus of nsp8 subunits
were not observed. To better resolved this region, a local mask for the N-terminal region of
nsp8 subunits and the RNA duplex was applied to perform 3D classification without particle
alignment. However, no definable class with a long helix track could be identified, suggesting
the flexibility of this region in the structure. This phenomenon might result from the shorter

RNA duplex observed in other structures27,29 that would help to stabilize the long helices. In
addition, this structure was restricted by some extent of preferred orientation of particles, which
somehow limited the attainable resolution in certain views of the final reconstruction. Basically,
the density map was sufficient to support faithful atomic modelling in most regions. The local
resolution distribution of the final density map was calculated with ResMap41.

Model building and refinement
The structure of Remdesivir bound SARS-CoV-2 polymerase complex (PDB ID: 7BV2) was
rigidly docked into the density map using CHIMERA42. The model was manually corrected for
local fit in COOT43. The structure of FTP was built using the “Ligand builder” plug-in in COOT
and manually fitted into the density. The initial model was refined in real space using PHENIX44
with the secondary structural restraints and Ramachandran restrains applied. The model was
further adjusted and refined iteratively for several rounds aided by the stereochemical quality
assessment using MolProbity45. The representative density and atomic models are shown in
Extended Data Fig. 3. The statistics for image processing and model refinement are summarized
in the Extended Data Table 1. Structural figures were prepared by either CHIMERA42 or
PyMOL (https://pymol.org/).

Extended Data Fig. 5. Conservation analysis of key catalytic residues of viral RdRps. The
sequences of different viral RdRps are aligned by the available structures in 3D. The
conservation scores are then mapped to the structure of SARS-CoV-2 polymerase. The residue
labels are colored by the different catalytic motifs as indicated.
