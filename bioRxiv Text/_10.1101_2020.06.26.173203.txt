44Abstract
45The emergence of the novel human coronavirus, SARS-CoV-2, causes a global COVID-19
46(coronavirus disease 2019) pandemic. Here, we have characterized and compared viral populations
47of SARS-CoV-2 among COVID-19 patients within and across households. Our work showed an active
48viral replication activity in the human respiratory tract and the co-existence of genetically distinct
49viruses within the same host. The inter-host comparison among viral populations further revealed a
50narrow transmission bottleneck between patients from the same households, suggesting a dominated
51role of stochastic dynamics in both inter-host and intra-host evolutions.

summary

54In this study, we compared SARS-CoV-2 populations of 13 Chinese COVID-19 patients. Those viral
55populations contained a considerable proportion of viral sub-genomic messenger RNAs (sgmRNA),
56reflecting an active viral replication activity in the respiratory tract tissues. The comparison of 66
57identified intra-host variants further showed a low viral genetic distance between intra-household
58patients and a narrow transmission bottleneck size. Despite the co-existence of genetically distinct
59viruses within the same host, most intra-host minor variants were not shared between transmission
60pairs, suggesting a dominated role of stochastic dynamics in both inter-host and intra-host evolutions.
61Furthermore, the narrow bottleneck and active viral activity in the respiratory tract show that the
62passage of a small number of virions can cause infection. Our data have therefore delivered a key
63genomic resource for the SARS-CoV-2 transmission research and enhanced our understanding of the
64evolutionary dynamics of SARS-CoV-2.

66Introduction
67The rapid spread of the novel human coronavirus, SARS-CoV-2, has been causing millions of COVID6819 (coronavirus disease 2019) cases with high mortality rate worldwide [1,2]. As an RNA virus, SARS69CoV-2 mutates frequently due to the lack of sufficient mismatch repairing mechanisms during genome
70replication [3], leading to the development of genetically different viruses within the same host.
71Several studies have reported intra-host single nucleotide variants (iSNVs) in SARS-CoV-2 [4–6].
72Recently, we investigated the intra-host evolution of SARS-CoV-2 and revealed genetic differentiation
73among tissue-specific populations [7]. However, it is still not clear how the intra-host variants circulate

74among individuals. Here, we described and compared viral populations of SARS-CoV-2 among
75COVID-19 patients within and across households. Our work here demonstrated the utilization of viral
76genomic information to identify transmission linkage of this virus.
77
78Results

and discussion

79Using both metatranscriptomic and hybrid-capture based techniques, we newly deep sequenced
80respiratory tract (RT) samples of seven COVID-19 patients in Guangdong, China, including two pairs
81of patients from the same households, respectively (P03 and P11; P23 and P24). The data were then
82combined with those of 23 RT samples used in our previous study [7], yielding a combined data set of
8330 RT samples from 13 COVID-19 patients (Table S1).
84

A sustained viral population should be supported by an active viral replication [8]. We firstly

85estimated the viral transcription activity within RT samples using viral sub-genomic messenger RNAs
86(sgmRNAs), which is only synthesised in infected host cells [9]. The sgmRNA abundance was
87measured as the ratio of short reads spanning the transcription regulatory sequence (TRS) sites to
88the viral genomic reads. The sgmRNA abundance within nasal and throat swab samples was similar
89to that within sputum samples (Figure 1a), reflecting an active viral replication in the upper respiratory
90tract. Notably, the patient P01, who eventually passed away due to COVID-19, showed the highest
91level of sgmRNA abundance (Figure S1). Among the samples from patients with improved clinical
92outcomes, their viral Ct (cycle threshold) value of reverse transcriptase quantitative PCR (RT-qPCR)
93negatively correlated with the days post symptoms onset (Figure 1b). Interestingly, the sgmRNA
94abundance showed a similar trend across time (Figure 1c). This result is further strengthened by the
95positive correlation between sgmRNA abundance and the Ct value (Figure 1d), reflecting a direct
96biological association between viral replication and viral shedding in the respiratory tract tissues.
97

Using the metatranscriptomic data, we identified 66 iSNVs in protein encoding regions with the

98alternative allele frequency (AAF) ranged from 5% to 95% (Table S2 and Table S3). The identified
99iSNVs showed a high concordance between the AAFs derived from metatranscriptomic and that from
100hybrid-capture sequences (Spearman’s ρ = 0.81, P < 2.2e-16; Figure S2). We firstly looked for
101signals of natural selection against intra-host variants. Using the Fisher’s exact test, we compared the
102number of iSNV sites on each codon position against that of the other two positions and detected a
103signiﬁcant difference among them (codon position 1[n = 10, P = 0.02], 2 [n = 21; P = 1] and 3 [n = 35;

104P = 0.03]). However, those iSNVs did not show a discriminated AAF among the non-synonymous and
105synonymous categories (Figure 2a), suggesting that most non-synonymous variants were not under
106an effective purifying selection within the host. Among the 66 identified iSNVs, 30 were coincided with
107the consensus variants in the public database (Table S2). Those iSNVs were categorised into
108common iSNVs, while the iSNVs presented in a single patient were categorised into rare iSNVs.
109Interestingly, the common iSNVs had a significant higher minor allele frequency compared to the rare
110iSNVs (Figure S3; Wilcoxon rank sum test, P = 2.7e-05), suggesting that they may have been
111developed in earlier strains before the most recent infection.
112

We then estimated the viral genetic distance among samples in a pairwise manner based on their

113iSNVs and allele frequencies. The samples were firstly categorised into intra-host pairs (serial
114samples from the same host), intra-household pairs and inter-household pairs (Figure 2b and Table
115S4). As expected, the intra-host pairs had the lowest genetic distance compared to either intra116household pairs (Wilcoxon rank sum test, P = 0.018) and inter-household pairs (Wilcoxon rank sum
117test, P < 2.22e-16). Interestingly, the genetic distance between intra-household pairs was significantly
118lower than that of inter-household pairs (Figure 2b; Wilcoxon rank sum test, P = 0.03), supporting a
119direct passage of virions among intra-household individuals. Nonetheless, we only observed a few
120minor variants shared among intra-household pairs, suggesting that the estimated genetic similarity
121was mostly determined by consensus nucleotide differences (Figure 2c,d). Specifically, in one intra122household pair (P23 and P24), one patient (P23) contained iSNVs that were coincided with the linked
123variants, C8782T and T28144C, suggesting that this patient may have been co-infected by genetically
124distinct viruses. However, the strain carrying C8782T and T28144C was not observed in the intra125household counterpart (P24). It is likely that there is a narrow transmission bottleneck allowing only
126the major strain to be circulated, if P23 was infected by all the observed viral strains before the
127transmission.
128

The transmission bottlenecks among intra-household pairs were estimated using a beta binomial

129model, which was designed to allow some temporal stochastic dynamics of viral population in the
130recipient [10]. Here, we defined the donor and recipient within the intra-household pairs according to
131their dates of the first symptom onset. The estimated bottleneck sizes were 6 (P03 and P11) and 8
132(P23 and P24) for the two intra-household pairs (Table S5). This result is consistent with the patterns
133observed in many animal viruses and human respiratory viruses [11,12], while the only study reporting

134a loose bottleneck among human respiratory viral infections [13] was argued as the generic
135consequence of shared iSNVs caused by read mapping artefacts [14]. The relatively narrow
136transmission bottleneck sizes is expected to increase the variance of viral variants being circulated
137between transmission pairs [15]. Even after successful transmission, virions carrying the minor
138variants are likely to be purged out due to the frequent stochastic dynamics within the respiratory tract
139[7], which is also consistent with the low diversity and instable iSNV observed among the RT samples.
140

The observed narrow transmission bottleneck suggests that, in general, only a few virions

141successfully enter host cells and eventually cause infection. Although the number of transmitted
142virions is sparse, they can easily replicate in the respiratory tract, given the observed viral replication
143activities in all the RT sample types and the high host-cell receptor binding affinity of SARS-CoV-2
144[16]. The narrow transmission bottleneck also indicate that instant hand hygiene and mask-wearing
145might be particular effective in blocking the transmission chain of SARS-CoV-2.
146

In summary, we have characterized and compared SARS-CoV-2 populations of patients within and

147across households using both metatranscriptomic and hybrid-capture based techniques. Our work
148showed an active viral replication activity in the human respiratory tract and the co-existence of
149genetically distinct viruses within the same host. The inter-host comparison among viral populations
150further revealed a narrow transmission bottleneck between patients from the same households,
151suggesting a dominated role of stochastic dynamics in both inter-host and intra-host evolution. The
152present work enhanced our understanding of SARS-CoV-2 virus transmission and shed light on the
153integration of genomic and epidemiological in the control of this virus.

154Materials

and methods

155Patient and Ethics statement
156Respiratory tract (RT) samples, including nasal swabs, throat swabs, sputum, were collected from 13
157COVID-19 patients during the early outbreak of the pandemic (from January 25 to February 10 of
1582020). Those patients were hospitalized at the first affiliated hospital of Guangzhou Medical University
159(10 patients), the fifth affiliated hospital of Sun Yat-sen University (1 patient), Qingyuan People’s
160Hospital (1 patient) and Yangjiang People’s Hospital (1 patient). The research plan was assessed and
161approved by the Ethics Committee of each hospital. All the privacy information was anonymized.
162
163Dataset description
164Public consensus sequences were downloaded from GISAID.
165
166Real-time RT-qPCR and sequencing
167RNA was extracted from the clinical RT samples using QIAamp Viral RNA Mini Kit (Qiagen, Hilden,
168Germany), which was then tested for SARS-CoV-2 using Real-time RT-qPCR. Human DNA was
169removed using DNase I and RNA concentration was measured using Qubit RNA HS Assay Kit
170(Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA, USA). After human DNA-depletion, the samples were RNA
171purified and then subjected to double-stranded DNA library construction using the MGIEasy RNA
172Library preparation reagent set (MGI, Shenzhen, China) following the method used in the previous
173study [17]. Possible contamination during experimental processing was tracked using human breast
174cell lines (Michigan Cancer Foundation-7). The constructed libraries were converted to DNA nanoballs
175(DNBs) and then sequenced on the DNBSEQ-T7 platform (MGI, Shenzhen, China), generating
176paired-end short reads with 100bp in length. Most samples were also sequenced using hybrid
177capture-based enrichment approach that was described in previous study [17]. Briefly, the SARS178CoV-2 genomic content was enriched from the double-stranded DNA libraries using the 2019179nCoVirus DNA/RNA Capture Panel (BOKE, Jiangsu, China). The enriched SARS-CoV-2 genomic
180contents were converted to DNBs and then sequenced on the MGISEQ-2000 platform, generating
181paired-end short reads with 100bp in length.

183Data filtering
184Read data from both metatranscriptomic and hybrid capture based sequencing were filtered following
185the steps described in the previous research [17]. In brief, short read data were mapped to a database
186that contains major coronaviridae genomes. Low-quality, adaptor contaminations, duplications, and
187low-complexity within the mapped reads were removed to generate the high quality coronaviridae-like
188short read data.
189
190Profiling of sub-genomic messenger RNA (sgmRNAs)
191Coronaviridae-like short reads were mapped to the reference genome (EPI_ISL_402119) using the
192aligner HISAT2 [18]. Reads spanning the transcription regulatory sequence (TRS) sites of both leader
193region and the coding genes (S gene, ORF3a, 6, 7a, 8, E, M and N gene) were selected to represent
194the sgmRNAs. The junction sites were predicted using RegTools junctions extract [19]. The ratio of
195sgmRNA reads to the viral genomic RNA reads (sgmRNA ratio) was used to estimate the relative
196transcription activity of SARS-CoV-2.
197
198Detection of intra-host variants
199We defined an intra-host single nucleotide variant (iSNV) as the co-existence of an alternative allele
200and the reference allele at the same genomic position within the same sample. To identify iSNV sites,
201paired-end metatranscriptomic coronaviridae-like short read data were mapped to the reference
202genome (EPI_ISL_402119) using BWA aln (v.0.7.16) with default parameters [20]. The duplicated

(v.

206(https://github.com/alimanfoo/pysamstats). The variable sites of each sample were identified using the
207variant caller LoFreq with default filters and the cut-off of 5% minor allele frequency. After filtering the
208sites with more than one alternative allele, the rest sites were regarded as iSNV sites. All the iSNVs
209with less than five metatranscriptomic reads were verified using the hybrid capture data (at least two
210reads). The identified iSNVs were then annotated using the SnpEff (v.2.0.5) with default settings [21].

212Genetic distance
213The genetic distance between sample pairs was calculated using L1-norm distance, as defined by the
214following formula. The L1-norm distance ( D ) between sample pairs is calculated by summing the
215distance of all the variable loci ( N ). The distance on each variable locus is calculated between vectors

d ( p , q ) between two samples ( p ,q ) is the square root of sum of distance across

220all the variable loci ( N ), as defined by the following formula.

225Beta binomial model of bottleneck size estimation
226A beta-binomial model was used to estimate bottleneck sizes between donors and recipients. Here,
227the bottleneck size represents the number of virions that pass into the recipient and finally shape the
228sequenced viral population. The patient with the earlier symptom onset date was defined as the
229donor, while the other was defined as the recipient. The maximum-likelihood estimates (MLE) of
230bottleneck sizes were estimated within 95% confidence intervals.
