An outbreak of a novel coronavirus, now named SARS-CoV-2, causing respiratory disease and
a ~2% case fatality rate started in Wuhan, China in December 2019. Following unprecedented
rapid global spread, the World Health Organization declared COVID-19 a pandemic on March
11, 2020. Although data on disease in humans are emerging at a steady pace, certain aspects
of the pathogenesis of SARS-CoV-2 can only be studied in detail in animal models, where
repeated sampling and tissue collection is possible. Here, we show that SARS-CoV-2 causes
respiratory disease in infected rhesus macaques, with disease lasting 8-16 days. Pulmonary
infiltrates, a hallmark of human disease, were visible in lung radiographs of all animals. High
viral loads were detected in swabs from the nose and throat of all animals as well as in
bronchoalveolar lavages; in one animal we observed prolonged rectal shedding. Taken
together, the rhesus macaque recapitulates moderate disease observed in the majority of
human cases. The establishment of the rhesus macaque as a model of COVID-19 will increase
our understanding of the pathogenesis of this disease and will aid development and testing of
medical countermeasures.

A novel coronavirus, designated SARS-CoV-2, emerged in Wuhan, China at the end of 2019

and quickly spread across the globe. The World Health Organization declared a public health

emergency of international concern on January 30, 2020 and, when the spread of SARS-CoV-2

continued at a rapid pace, a pandemic on March 11, 2020. As of March 19, 2020, more than

240,000 cases have been identified in at least 160 countries, including more than 10,000 fatal

cases . Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) has a broad clinical spectrum ranging from mild to

Non-human primate models that recapitulate aspects of human disease are essential for our

understanding of the pathogenic processes involved in severe respiratory disease. In addition,

these models are crucial for the development of medical countermeasures such as vaccines and

antivirals. Previously, we successfully established rhesus macaques as an animal model for the

pre-clinical development of vaccines and antivirals against the related Middle East Respiratory

15-17

Syndrome Coronavirus (MERS-CoV)

. Here, we provide a detailed description of a rhesus

macaque model of moderate COVID-19.

Clinical, respiratory disease upon inoculation with SARS-CoV-2

Eight adult rhesus macaques were inoculated with a total dose of 2.6x10

isolate nCoV-WA1-2020

TCID50 of SARS-CoV-2

via a combination of intratracheal, intranasal, ocular and oral routes.

On day 1 post inoculation (dpi), all animals showed changes in respiratory pattern and

piloerection, as reflected in their clinical scores (Fig. 1a). Other observed signs of disease

included reduced appetite, hunched posture, pale appearance and dehydration (Table S1).

Disease signs persisted for more than a week, with all animals completely recovered between 9

and 17 dpi (Fig. 1a and Table S1). Weight loss was observed in all animals (Fig. 1b); body

temperatures spiked on 1 dpi but returned to normal levels thereafter (Fig. 1c). Under

anesthesia, the animals did not show increased respiration; however, all animals showed

irregular respiration patterns (Fig. 1d). Radiographs showed pulmonary infiltrates in all animals

starting on 1 dpi with mild pulmonary infiltration primarily in the lower lung lobes. By 3 dpi,

progression of mild pulmonary infiltration was noted into other lung lobes although still

primarily in the caudal lung lobes (Fig. 1e). In one animal, pulmonary infiltrates were observed

from 1-12 dpi (Fig. 2). This animal had a moderate pulmonary infiltration in the upper right lung

lobe starting on 3 dpi, with resolution by 7 dpi. However, on 10 dpi, pulmonary infiltration

appeared to reappear in previously affected lung lobes. These signs began to resolve by 14 dpi

(Fig. 2).

Hematologic analysis of blood collected during clinical exams showed evidence of a stress

by 1 dpi in the majority of animals characterized by leukocytosis, neutrophilia,

monocytosis and lymphopenia (Fig. S1). Lymphocytes and monocytes returned to baseline after

1 dpi. Neutrophils decreased in all animals by 3 dpi and continued to decline through 5 dpi;

neutropenia was observed in 2 of 4 animals. Neutrophils continued to be depressed through 10

dpi and began to recover thereafter. On 1 dpi, decreased hematocrit, red blood cell counts and

hemoglobin were observed in all animals (Fig. S1). In 3 of 4 animals, the values remained low or

continued to decrease until 5 dpi. In addition, reticulocyte percentages and counts also

decreased during this time period. At 5 dpi, two of the four animals had a normocytic,

normochromic non-regenerative anemia consistent with anemia of critical illness. Although the

anemia appeared to stabilize and parameters improved slightly, both animals did not return to

their original baselines by 21 dpi. Blood chemistry analysis revealed no values outside normal

range throughout the experiment (Table S2).

Serum was analyzed for changes in cytokine and chemokine levels at different time points after

inoculation. Statistically significant changes were only observed on 1 dpi, with increases in

IL1ra, IL6, IL10, IL15, MCP-1, MIP-1b, and on 3 dpi a small but statistically significant decrease in

TGFα was observed (Fig. S2). Although changes occurred in the levels of some of these

cytokines later after inoculation, these mostly occurred in single animals and were thus not

statistically significant (Fig. S2).

High viral loads in respiratory samples
During clinical exams, nose, throat, rectal and urogenital swabs were collected (Fig. 3a). Virus

shedding was highest from the nose; virus could be isolated from swabs collected on 1 and 3

dpi, but not thereafter. Viral loads were high in throat swabs immediately after inoculation but

were less consistent than nose swabs thereafter; in one animal throat swabs were positive on 1

and 10 dpi but not on any of the sampling dates in between. One animal showed prolonged

shedding of viral RNA in rectal swabs from 7-17 dpi; infectious virus could not be isolated from

these swabs (Fig. 3a). Urogenital swabs remained negative in all animals throughout the study.

On 1, 3 and 5 dpi bronchoalveolar lavages (BAL) were performed on the 4 animals in the group

euthanized on 21 dpi as a measure of virus replication in the lower respiratory tract. High viral

loads were detected in BAL fluid in all animals on all three time points; infectious virus could

only be isolated in BAL fluid collected on 1 and 3 dpi. No viral RNA could be detected in blood

throughout the study (Fig. 3c) or urine collected at 3 and 21 dpi (Fig. 2d).

Interstitial pneumonia centered on terminal bronchioles
On 3 and 21 dpi, one group of 4 animals was euthanized and necropsies were performed.

On 3 dpi, varying degrees of gross lung lesions were observed in all animals (Fig. 4a and c). By

21 dpi, gross lesions were still visible in the lungs of 2 of 4 animals (Fig. 4b and c). Additionally,

all animals had an increased lung weight:body weight ratio (Fig. 4d), indicative of pulmonary

edema. Histologically, 3 of the 4 animals euthanized on 3 dpi developed some degree of

pulmonary pathology. Lesions were multifocal (Fig. S3), mild to moderate, interstitial

pneumonia that frequently centered on terminal bronchioles. The pneumonia was

characterized by thickening of alveolar septae by edema fluid and fibrin and small to moderate

numbers of macrophages and fewer neutrophils. Alveoli contained small numbers of pulmonary

macrophages and neutrophils. Lungs with moderate changes also had alveolar edema and fibrin

with formation of hyaline membranes. There was minimal type II pneumocyte hyperplasia.

Occasionally, bronchioles showed necrosis, loss and attenuation of the epithelium with

infiltrates of neutrophils, macrophages and eosinophils. Multifocally, there were perivascular

infiltrates of small numbers of lymphocytes forming perivascular cuffs. Three of 4 animals on 3

dpi had fibrous adhesions of the lung to the pleura. Histologic evaluation shows these to be

composed of mature collagen interspersed with small blood vessels; therefore, this is most

likely a chronic change rather than related to SARS-CoV-2 infection.

Immunohistochemistry using a mAb against SARS-CoV demonstrated viral antigen in small

numbers of type I and II pneumocytes, as well as alveolar macrophages. Antigen-positive

macrophages were detected in mediastinal lymph nodes of 3 of 4 animals. Interestingly, small

numbers of antigen-positive lymphocytes and macrophages were also detected in the lamina

propria of the intestinal tract of all 4 animals. In one animal, all collected tissues of the

gastrointestinal tract showed these antigen-positive mononuclear cells (Fig. S4).

Ultrastructural analysis of lung tissue by transmission electron microscopy confirmed the

histologic diagnosis of interstitial pneumonia. The alveolar interstitial space was greatly

expanded by edema, fibrin, macrophages and neutrophils (Fig. 5a). The subepithelial basement

membrane was unaffected and maintained a consistent thickness and electron density.

Occasionally, type I pneumocytes are separated from the basement membrane by edema; the

resulting space may contain virions.

Affected type I pneumocyte are lined by small to moderate

numbers of virions 90-160 nm in diameter with an electron dense core bound by a less dense

capsid (Fig5b-e). Alveolar spaces adjacent to affected pneumocytes are filled with a granular,

moderately electron dense material that is consistent with edema fluid.

SARS-CoV-2 mainly replicates in the respiratory tract
All tissues (n=37) collected at necropsy were analyzed for the presence of viral RNA. On 3 dpi,

high viral loads were detected in the lungs of all animals (Fig. 6a); virus could be isolated from

the lungs of all 4 animals at this time. Additionally, viral RNA could be detected in other samples

throughout the respiratory tract (Fig. 6), as well as in lymphoid tissue and in gastrointestinal

tissues from several animals. Viral RNA could not be detected in major organs including the

central nervous system. In an attempt to distinguish viral RNA derived from respiratory

secretions from active virus replication, all samples with presence of viral RNA were also tested

for the presence of viral mRNA (Fig. 6). Viral mRNA was detected in all respiratory tissues could

not be detected in any but one of the gastrointestinal tissues, indicating that virus replication in

these tissues seems unlikely, although we can’t exclude it due to limited size of the tested

samples. By 21 dpi, viral RNA, but not mRNA, could still be detected in tissues from all 4 animals

(Fig. S5). In the animal with prolonged rectal shedding (Fig. 3a) and enlarged mesenteric lymph

nodes on 21 dpi (Table S1), viral RNA could be detected in the mesenteric lymph nodes but not

in any gastrointestinal tissues.

Serology
Serum was analyzed for the development of IgG against SARS-CoV spike in ELISA. By 10 dpi, all

four animals had seroconverted to SARS-CoV-2 spike.

At 21 dpi ELISA titers ranged between

1600 – 3200 for all four animals. Neutralizing responses also started to appear at 10 dpi, and

ranged from 10 – 60 at 21 dpi (Figure S6). Interestingly, the animal with the lowest and latest

neutralizing antibody response was the animal with prolonged viral shedding from the

intestinal tract.

outcome

. A recent analysis of 1099 COVID-19 cases from China showed that

approximately 5% of diagnosed patients developed severe pneumonia requiring ICU

9

attendance, 2.3% required mechanical ventilation and 1.4% died . The transient, moderate

disease developed within our rhesus macaque model is thus in line with the vast majority of

human COVID-19 cases. Pulmonary infiltrates on radiographs, a hallmark of human

11,12

macaques is strikingly similar to that observed in humans

. In humans, consistent high SARS-

CoV-2 shedding was observed from the upper and lower respiratory tract, frequent

13

intermediate shedding from the intestinal tract and sporadic detection in blood

. In rhesus

macaques, high viral loads were detected in nasal swabs that remained positive for up to 14

days after inoculation; throat swabs were intermittently positive for up to 12 days and rectal

swabs up to 17 days. Similar to what has been observed in humans, shedding of SARS-CoV-2

continued after resolution of clinical symptoms and radiologic abnormalities

model, where IgG responses were detected around 7-10 dpi and IgG titers peaked between 12

Taken together, we conclude that the rhesus macaque model recapitulates COVID-19, with

clear evidence of virus replication in the upper and lower respiratory tract, shedding upper,

lower respiratory and intestinal tract, the presence of pulmonary infiltrates, histological lesions

resembling those observed with SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV and seroconversion. This extensive

dataset allows us to bridge between the our Rhesus macaques model and the disease observed

in humans and to utilize this animal model to assess the clinical and virological efficacy of

medical countermeasures. We have therefore moved forward to test antiviral treatments and

vaccines in this model.

Methods
Ethics and biosafety statement
All animal experiments were approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee of

Rocky Mountain Laboratories, NIH and carried out by certified staff in an Association for

Assessment and Accreditation of Laboratory Animal Care (AAALAC) International accredited

facility, according to the institution’s guidelines for animal use, following the guidelines and

basic principles in the NIH Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals, the Animal

Welfare Act, United States Department of Agriculture and the United States Public Health

Service Policy on Humane Care and Use of Laboratory Animals. Rhesus macaques were housed

in adjacent individual primate cages allowing social interactions, in a climate-controlled room

with a fixed light-dark cycle (12-hr light/12-hr dark). Animals were monitored at least twice

daily throughout the experiment. Commercial monkey chow, treats, and fruit were provided

twice daily by trained personnel. Water was available ad libitum. Environmental enrichment

consisted of a variety of human interaction, manipulanda, commercial toys, videos, and music.

The Institutional Biosafety Committee (IBC) approved work with infectious SARS-CoV-2 strains

under BSL3 conditions. Sample inactivation was performed according to IBC-approved standard

operating procedures for removal of specimens from high containment.

Study design
To evaluate the use of rhesus macaques as a model for SARS-CoV-2, eight adult rhesus

macaques (4 males, 4 females) were inoculated via a combination of intranasal (0.5ml per

5

nostril), intratracheal (4ml), oral (1ml) and ocular (0.25ml per eye) of a 4x10

TCID50/ml virus

dilution in sterile DMEM. The animals were observed twice daily for clinical signs of disease

32

; the same person assessed the

animals throughout the study. The predetermined endpoint for this experiment was 3 days post

inoculation (dpi) for one group of 4 animals, and 21 dpi for the remaining 4 animals. Clinical

exams were performed on 0, 1, 3, 5, 7, 10, 12, 14, 17 and 21 dpi on anaesthetized animals. On

exam days, clinical parameters such as bodyweight, body temperature and respiration rate

were collected, as well as ventro-dorsal and lateral chest radiographs. Chest radiographs were

interpreted by a board-certified clinical veterinarian. The following samples were collected at all

clinical exams: nasal, throat, urogenital and rectal swabs, blood. The total white blood cell

count, lymphocyte, neutrophil, platelet, reticulocyte and red blood cell counts, hemoglobin,

and hematocrit values were determined from EDTA blood with the IDEXX ProCyte DX analyzer

(IDEXX Laboratories). Serum biochemistry (albumin, AST, ALT, GGT, BUN, creatinine) was

analyzed using the Piccolo Xpress Chemistry Analyzer and Piccolo General Chemistry 13 Panel

discs (Abaxis). During clinical exams on 1, 3, and 5 dpi bronchoalveolar lavages were performed

using 10ml sterile saline. After euthanasia, necropsies were performed. The percentage of gross

lung lesions was scored by a board-certified veterinary pathologist and samples of the following

tissues were collected: inguinal lymph node, axillary lymph node, cervical lymph node, salivary

gland, conjunctiva, nasal mucosa, oropharynx, tonsil, trachea, all six lung lobes, mediastinal

lymph node, right and left bronchus, heart, liver, spleen, pancreas, adrenal gland, kidney,

mesenteric lymph node, stomach, duodenum, jejunum, ileum, cecum, colon, urinary bladder,

reproductive tract (testes or ovaries depending on sex of the animal), bone marrow, frontal

brain, cerebellum and brainstem. Histopathological analysis of tissue slides was performed by a

board-certified veterinary pathologist blinded to the group assignment of the animals.

Virus and cells
18

SARS-CoV-2 isolate nCoV-WA1-2020 (MN985325.1)

(Vero passage 3) was kindly provided by

CDC and propagated once in VeroE6 cells in DMEM (Sigma) supplemented with 2% fetal bovine

serum (Gibco), 1 mM L-glutamine (Gibco), 50 U/ml penicillin and 50 μg/ml streptomycin (Gibco)

(virus isolation medium). The used virus stock was 100% identical to the initial deposited

genbank sequence (MN985325.1) and no contaminants were detected. VeroE6 cells were

maintained in DMEM supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum, 1 mM L-glutamine, 50 U/ml

penicillin and 50 μg/ml streptomycin.

Quantitative PCR
RNA was extracted from swabs and BAL using the QiaAmp Viral RNA kit (Qiagen) according to

the manufacturer’s instructions. Tissues (30 mg) were homogenized in RLT buffer and RNA was

extracted using the RNeasy kit (Qiagen) according to the manufacturer’s instructions. For

33

detection of viral RNA, 5 µl RNA was used in a one-step real-time RT-PCR E assay

using the

Rotor-Gene probe kit (Qiagen) according to instructions of the manufacturer. In each run,

standard dilutions of counted RNA standards were run in parallel, to calculate copy numbers in

the samples. For detection of SARS-CoV-2 mRNA, primers targeting open reading frame 7

(ORF7) were designed as follows: forward primer 5’-TCCCAGGTAACAAACCAACC-3’, reverse

primer 5’-GCTCACAAGTAGCGAGTGTTAT-3’, and probe FAM-ZEN-

CTTGTAGATCTGTTCTCTAAACGAAC-IBFQ. 5 µl RNA was used in a one-step real-time RT-PCR

using the Rotor-Gene probe kit (Qiagen) according to instructions of the manufacturer. In each

run, standard dilutions of counted RNA standards were run in parallel, to calculate copy

numbers in the samples.

Histopathology and immunohistochemistry
Histopathology and immunohistochemistry were performed on rhesus macaque tissues. After

fixation for a minimum of 7 days in 10 % neutral-buffered formalin and embedding in paraffin,

tissue sections were stained with hematoxylin and eosin (HE). To detect SARS-CoV-2 antigen,

immunohistochemistry was performed using an anti-SARS nucleocapsid protein antibody

(Novus Biologicals) at a 1:250 dilution. Stained slides were analyzed by a board-certified

veterinary pathologist.

Transmission electron microscopy

. After fixation for 7 days with Karnovsky’s fixative at 4° C,

excised tissues were post-fixed for 1 hour with 0.5% osmium tetroxide/0.8% potassium

ferricyanide in 0.1 M sodium cacodylate, washed 3 x 5 minutes with 0.1M sodium cacodylate

buffer, stained 1 hour with 1% tannic acid, washed with buffer and then further stained with2%

osmium tetroxide in 0.1M sodium cacodylate and overnight with 1% uranyl acetate at 4° C.

Specimens were dehydrated with a graded ethanol series with two final exchanges in 100%

propylene oxide before infiltration and final embedding in Embed-812/Araldite resin. Thin

sections were cut with a Leica EM UC6 ultramicrotome (Leica, Vienna, Austria), prior to viewing

at 120 kV on a Tecnai BT Spirit transmission electron microscope (Thermo fisher/FEI, Hillsboro,

OR). Digital images were acquired with a Gatan Rio bottom mount digital camera system

(Gatan Inc., Pleasanton, CA and processed using Adobe Photoshop v. CC 2019 (Adobe Systems

Inc, San Jose, CA).

Research Center, NIH) and blocked with blocker casein in PBS (Life Technologies). Sera were

serially diluted in duplicate. SARS-CoV-2-specific antibodies were detected using anti-monkey

IgG polyclonal antibody HRP-conjugated antibody (KPL), peroxidase-substrate reagent (KPL) and

stop reagent (KPL). Optical density (OD) was measured at 405Tnm. The threshold of positivity

was calculated by taking the average of the day 0 values multiplied by 3.

For neutralization, sera were heat-inactivated (30 min, 56 °C) and two-fold serial dilutions were

prepared in 2% DMEM. Hereafter, 100 TCID50 of SARS-CoV-2 was added. After 60 min

incubation at 37 °C, virus:serum mixture was added to VeroE6 cells and incubated at 37°C and

5% CO2. At 5 dpi, cytopathic effect was scored. The virus neutralization titer is expressed as the

reciprocal value of the highest dilution of the serum which still inhibited virus replication. All

sera were analyzed in duplicate.

Figures

Figure 1. Rhesus macaques infected with SARS-CoV-2 develop respiratory disease.

Eight adult

rhesus macaques were inoculated with SARS-CoV-2 isolate nCoV-WA1-2020. After inoculation,

animals were observed for disease signs and scored according to a pre-established clinical

scoring sheet (a). On days when clinical exams were performed, body weight (b), and body

temperature (c) were measured. Respiration rate was measured, and breathing pattern was

recorded, with irregular respiration patterns indicated in red (d). Ventro-dorsal and lateral

radiographs were taken on clinical exam days and scored for the presence of pulmonary

infiltrates by a clinical veterinarian according to a standard scoring system (0: normal; 1: mild

interstitial pulmonary infiltrates; 2: moderate pulmonary infiltrates perhaps with partial cardiac

border effacement and small areas of pulmonary consolidation; 3: severe interstitial infiltrates,

large areas of pulmonary consolidation, alveolar patterns and air bronchograms). Individual

Figure 3. Viral loads in respiratory samples and bodily fluids.

Eight adult rhesus macaques

were inoculated with SARS-CoV-2 isolate nCoV-WA1-2020. After inoculation, clinical exams

were performed during which nose, throat, rectal and urogenital swabs were collected; viral

loads in these samples were determined by qRT-PCR (a). On 1, 3, and 5 dpi, bronchoalveolar

lavages were performed on the 4 animals remaining in the study through 21 dpi; viral loads and

virus titers were determined in these samples. Viral loads were also determined in blood

collected during clinical exams (c) and in urine collected at necropsy on 3 and 21 (d). Grey: data

derived from animals euthanized on 3 dpi; black: data derived from animals euthanized on 21

dpi; red: virus was isolated from these samples. Identical symbols have been used to denote

identical animals throughout the figures in this manuscript.
