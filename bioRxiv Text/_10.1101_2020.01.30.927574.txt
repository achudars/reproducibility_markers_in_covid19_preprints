Summary
Coronaviruses such as the newly discovered virus from Wuhan, China, 2019-nCoV, and the viruses that cause
SARS and MERS, have resulted in regional and global public health emergencies. Based on our molecular
insight that the hepatitis C virus and the coronavirus use a similar viral genome replication mechanism, we
reasoned that the FDA-approved drug EPCLUSA (Sofosbuvir/Velpatasvir) for the treatment of hepatitis C will
also inhibit the above coronaviruses, including 2019-nCoV. To develop broad spectrum anti-viral agents, we
further describe a novel strategy to design and synthesize viral polymerase inhibitors, by combining the
ProTide Prodrug approach used in the development of Sofosbuvir with the use of 3’-blocking groups that we
have previously built into nucleotide analogues that function as polymerase terminators.

The recent appearance of clusters of a new coronaviral infection in Wuhan, China has made headlines, as
more and more people have become infected in China and in a number of other countries. Already more
than 100 deaths have been ascribed to this virus, and there are fears of additional outbreaks. The virus has
been isolated from the lower respiratory tracts of patients with pneumonia, sequenced and visualized by
electron microscopy (Zhu et al 2020). The virus, which has received the placeholder name 2019-nCoV, turns
out to be a new member of the subgenus sarbecovirus, in the Orthocoronavirinae subfamily, but is distinct
from MERS CoV and SARS CoV (Zhu et al 2020). The coronaviruses are positive-sense, single strand RNA
viruses, and thus share properties with other single-stranded RNA viruses such as hepatitis C virus, West Nile
virus, Marburg virus, HIV virus, Ebola virus, dengue virus, and rhinoviruses.
The coronavirus life cycle is depicted in Fig. 1, which is taken from a review by Zumla et al (2016). Briefly, the
virus enters the cell by endocytosis, is uncoated and ORF1a and ORF1b of the + strand RNA is translated to
produce nonstructural proteins, including a cysteine protease, a serine protease, helicase and RNAdependent RNA polymerase (RdRp). The proteases cleave the precursor forms of the helicase and RdRp to
form mature, functional molecules. A replication-transcription complex is then formed, which is responsible
for making more copies of the RNA genome via a negative-sense intermediate, as well as the structural and
other proteins encoded by the viral genome. The viral RNA is packaged into viral coats, attaches to the cell
surface, after which exocytosis results in release of viral particles for subsequent infectious cycles. Potential
inhibitors have been designed to attack nearly every stage of this process, as indicated in Fig. 1 (Zumla et al
2016). Despite decades of research, no effective drug is currently available to treat such serious coronavirus
infections as SARS, MERS, and the symptoms caused by 2019-nCoV.

One of the most important druggable targets is the RdRp. Example drugs include Gilead’s sofosbuvir (which
is paired with velpatasvir as the FDA-approved drug EPCLUSA), to inhibit the RNA-dependent RNA polymerase
of the hepatitis C virus. Sofosbuvir, a pyrimidine nucleotide analogue (Fig. 2) with a blocked phosphate group
enabling it to enter infected eukaryotic cells, is a prodrug, which is converted into its active triphosphate form
by cellular enzymes (Fig. 3). The activated drug binds in the active site of the RdRp, where it is incorporated
into RNA, and due to modifications at the 2’ position, inhibits further RNA chain extension and halts RNA
replication. It acts as an RNA polymerase inhibitor by competing with natural ribonucleotides.

Based on our insight that the hepatitis C virus and the coronavirus use a similar viral genome replication
mechanism, we reasoned that the FDA-approved drug EPCLUSA for the treatment of hepatitis C will also
inhibit coronaviruses, including 2019-nCoV and those responsible for SARS and MERS.

There are many other RNA polymerase inhibitor drugs which are used as antivirals. A related purine
nucleotide prodrug, remdesivir (Fig. 4), was developed by Gilead to treat Ebola virus infections, though not
very successfully, and is currently being considered for repositioning to treat the 2019-nCoV outbreak
(https://www.fiercebiotech.com/biotech/gilead-mulls-repositioning-failed-ebola-drug-china-virus).
In
contrast to sofosbuvir, both the 2’- and 3’-OH groups are unmodified, but a cyano group at the 1’ position

presumably serves to inhibit the RdRp in the active triphosphate form. Additional information on the ProTide
Prodrug technology is described by Alanazi et al (2019).

Fig. 4: Structure of remdesivir.
A related prodrug analogue developed by BioCryst Pharmaceuticals, BCX4430, also known as galidesivir (Fig.
5), has been shown to inhibit RNA polymerases from a broad spectrum of RNA viruses, notably including the
filoviruses (e.g., Ebola, Marburg) in rodents and Marburg virus in macaques (Warren et al 2014). Upon entry
into infected cells, BCX4430 is rapidly phosphorylated, and the resulting nucleoside triphosphate serves as
an RNA chain terminator.

Fig. 5: Structure of BCX4430.
Based on the above background information, we describe here a novel strategy to design and synthesize viral
polymerase inhibitors, by combining the ProTide Prodrug approach used in the development of Sofosbuvir
with the use of 3’-blocking groups that we have built into nucleotide analogues that function as reversible
terminators for DNA sequencing (Ju et al 2003, Ju et al 2006, Guo et al 2008). We reasoned that (1) the
phosphate masking groups will allow entry of the compounds into infected cells, (2) the 3’- blocking group
on the 3’-OH with either free 2’-OH or modifications at the 2’ position will encourage incorporation of the
activated triphosphate analogue by viral polymerases but not host cell polymerases, thus reducing any side
effects, and (3) once incorporated, further extension will be prevented by virtue of the 3’-blocking group,
thereby inhibiting viral replication. These modified nucleotide analogues should be potent polymerase
inhibitors and thus active against various viral diseases, including but not limited to the coronaviruses such

as 2019-nCoV, and the strains causing SARS and MERS. Once incorporated, our newly designed nucleotide
analogues containing 3’ blocking groups will permanently block further viral genome replication. This is in
contrast to other nucleotide analogue-based viral inhibitors that have a free 3’ OH group, which have the
possibility of allowing further polymerase extension, enabled by viral mutations. For the same reason, at high
concentrations, nucleotide analogue-based viral inhibitors with free 3’ OH groups have the potential of being
incorporated by host polymerases.
All RNA viruses are known to mutate at a high frequency, due to the low fidelity of the viral polymerase,
resulting in the development of resistance to treatment. The promiscuous nature of the viral polymerase will
allow incorporation of our newly designed nucleotide analogues as anti-viral agents.
Examples of nucleotide analogues designed by us to satisfy these criteria are provided in Fig. 6, and strategies
for their synthesis in Figs. 7-9; Fig. 10 shows the activation of these prodrugs to form triphosphate analogues
(same as for sofosbuvir in Fig. 3) that should be incorporated and inhibit the coronavirus and other RNA virus
polymerases.

Synthesis of 3’-O-blocked nucleoside phosphoramidate prodrugs can be carried out starting from 2’-modified
nucleosides (Ross et al 2011). First, both the 5’-OH and the exocyclic amino group of the base will be
protected. Then the 3’-OH will be derivatized with a variety of blocking groups, including methyl, ethyl,
propyl, allyl, propargyl, methoxymethyl, methylthiomethyl, azidomethyl, etc., such as those listed in Fig.6,
following established methods (Ju et al 2006, Guo et al 2008). After deprotection, the free 5’-OH is
derivatized to afford the corresponding phosphoramidates by treatment with freshly prepared
chlorophosphoramidate reagent in the presence of N-methyl imidazole (Sofia et al 2010). Fig. 7 and Fig. 8
show example synthetic routes for the 3’-methoxy and 3’-O-methylthiomethyl nucleoside phosphoramidate
analogs, respectively. Alternatively, starting from a 2’-modified nucleoside, the 5’-OH can be derivatized first
to give 5’-phosphoramidate nucleotides, followed by 3’-OH derivatization to afford 3’-O blocked nucleoside
phosphoramidate analogues. Fig. 9 shows an example synthetic route for 3’-allyl nucleoside
phosphoramidate analogues.
