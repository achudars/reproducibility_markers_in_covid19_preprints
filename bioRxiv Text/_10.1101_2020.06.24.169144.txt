Summary
In the last twenty years, three separate coronaviruses have left their typical animal hosts and
became human pathogens. An area of research interest is coronavirus transcription regulation
that uses an RNA-RNA mediated template-switching mechanism. It is not known how different
transcriptional stoichiometries of each viral gene are generated. Analysis of SARS-CoV-2 RNA
sequencing data from whole RNA transcriptomes identified TRS dependent and independent
transcripts. Integration of transcripts and 5’-UTR sequence motifs identified that the pentaloop
and the stem-loop 3 were also located upstream of spliced genes. TRS independent transcripts
were detected as likely non-polyadenylated. Additionally, a novel conserved sequence motif was
discovered at either end of the TRS independent splice junctions. While similar both SARS viruses
generated similar TRS independent transcripts they were more abundant in SARS-CoV-2. TRS
independent gene regulation requires investigation to determine its relationship to viral
pathogenicity.

Introduction
While coronaviruses (CoV) are endemic to much of the world, many are relatively harmless,
contributing along with other viral species to the common cold in humans(Coleman and Frieman,
2014). However, three recent events of coronaviruses jumping hosts have caused outbreaks of
lethal pulmonary infections. The SARS subtype infected thousands of people and killed 800 or
nearly 10% of all infected individuals. MERS was more harmful but spread poorly between
individuals(Coleman and Frieman, 2014). The most recent event COVID-19 (formerly 2019-nCoV)
began late 2019 is currently ongoing with millions infected and 100s of thousands of deaths. Also,
the preventative measures to reduce the spread of the virus is causing global economic
dysfunction. Intense global efforts are ongoing to develop vaccines and drug treatments. An
assessment of the regulation and expression of viral genes is needed to assist in the development
of diagnostics, vaccines and pharmaceutical interventions.
The coronavirus is a family of positive single-stranded RNA viruses that use only RNA to generate
RNA copies of its genome and subgenomic messenger RNA (sgmRNA) transcripts of specific
coding sequences(Sola et al., 2011; Yang and Leibowitz, 2015). RNA folding is essential to the
function of RNAs, and the CoV is no exception, with many predicted and verified stem-loop (SL)
structures and sequence motifs essential to the viral life cycle(Sola et al., 2011, 2015). After
infection, the viral genome is loaded on to the ribosome, and the first open reading frame ORF1a
is transcribed as a polycistronic message(von Brunn et al., 2007; Sola et al., 2011). The
polypeptide is cleaved by an encoded protease to release 15-16 non-structural proteins involved
in RNA replication. Another more extended polypeptide is expressed by a slip sequence
consisting of two stem-loops at the end of Orf1a. Within the ribosome, the slip sequence shifts
the reading frame to translate the Orf1b sequence.
Downstream of Orf1ab are 9-10 open reading frames that become expressed through the
formation of specific transcripts called subgenomic messenger RNAs (sgmRNA)(Sola et al., 2015).

Essential to sgmRNA synthesis are conserved sequences called the TRS-L in the 5’-UTR and the
TRS-B located upstream of multiple protein-coding genes. sgmRNAs of the CoV genome begin in
the 3’UTR where the viral RNA directed RNA polymerase (Rdrp) and its associated proteins create
a negative RNA copy to the viral genome(Kaye et al., 2006; Sola et al., 2015; Yang and Leibowitz,
2015). During the viral replication process, the Rdrp can skip the intervening sequence and bridge
a TRS-B sequence to the TRS-L of the 5’UTR, termed template switching(Sola et al., 2015). The
negative transcripts are next transcribed into positive strands and loaded on to the ribosome for
the production of viral proteins. The sgmRNA transcripts are differentially expressed by unknown
mechanisms to maintain a stoichiometric balance of transcripts for protein production and viral
assembly.
The TRS-L is part of a series of folded structures within the UTRs and is essential to both viral
genome replication and transcription(Yang and Leibowitz, 2015). The folds of the 5’ and 3’ UTRs
RNA of the coronavirus family are modelled using thermodynamic systems to find the lowest free
energy state. The models are compared to the solved structure of betacoronavirus 1 (more
commonly known as bovine coronavirus, BCoV) and murine coronavirus (MHV). In studies on the
SARS and MERS viruses, conserved SL structures were observed(Sola et al., 2011). However, few
studies have attempted to discover these sgmRNAs in CoV directly. Only one recent study
examined the expression of sgmRNAs during SARS-CoV-2 infection(Kim et al., 2020). They
observed that >95% of the viral transcripts used the TRS dependent mechanism. The TRS
independent sgmRNAs may be largely non-coding and showed increased presence of RNA
methylation. However, their methods for detecting and quantifying sgmRNAs used poly-A
dependent sequencing mechanisms, leaving the possibility that non-polyadenylated sgmRNAs
exist.
This current study aims to identify possible novel mechanisms of sgmRNA regulation that may be
useful in developing immunization strategies, therapeutic drugs and improving our
understanding of CoV biology. I assessed the 5’ and 3’UTRs using structure prediction methods
to characterize the similarities of the folded structures and locations of the TRS to other CoV.
Secondly, a detailed analysis of RNA-sequencing data from SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV infected
cell and animal models was conducted to determine the locations of spliced sgmRNAs and their

relative abundance. Sequence motif discovery and analysis were conducted with structural
prediction to assess the relationship to sgmRNA abundance. TRS independent transcripts were
assessed to identify possible known and novel regulatory motifs.

Results
SARS-CoV-2 has conserved 5’ and 3’ UTR structural elements with other CoV
Based on previously published analysis of the 5’- and 3’-UTR regions of several CoV family
members, there are conserved sequence motifs and folded RNA structures essential to the
regulation of viral genome replication and sub-genomic mRNA (sgmRNA) production(Sola et al.,
2011). I assessed the sequence and structural conservation of the 5’UTR regions of SARS-CoV-2
against SARS-CoV and MERS (Figure 1). In all three genomes, biomolecular prediction of the first
130 bases predicted four conserved stem-loops (SL) were observed: SL1 (involved in genomic
replication(Zhang et al., 1994)), SL2 (a conserved pentaloop sequence typical to many CoV
species(Zhang et al., 1994)), SL3 (containing the TRS-L sequence that is essential for the
generation of sgmRNA(Zhang et al., 1994)) and SL4. While previously published predictions of the
MERS 5'UTR indicated that the SL3 structural element is absent(Sola et al., 2011), I predicted an
SL3 stem-loop structure. There is no wet-lab experimental evidence of these stem-loops in SARSCoV, SARS-CoV -2 or MERS, and their functions are inferred based on related CoV species with
experimental evidence.

SARS-CoV-2 subgenomic RNAs
Given the presence of conserved 5’UTR sequences and structures in SARS-CoV-2, including the
TRS-L, sgmRNA should be observed in RNA sequencing data of infected cell or animal models. A
recently published study provided evidence of TRS dependent as well as independent sgmRNAs
of the SARS-CoV-2 genome(Kim et al., 2020). They reported that TRS independent sgmRNAs
represented only a minority of the total transcript (1.5%). However, the sequencing methods
utilized in that study could only capture RNAs with a polyadenylation sequence. It is not known

if all sgmRNA are polyadenylated. Some RNAs, especially non-coding RNAs, generally lack a polyA tail, which could explain poor detection of TRS independent sgmRNAs.
Using published sequencing data of ribosome depleted total RNA from SARS-CoV-2 infected cells
and animals(Blanco-Melo et al., 2020), I aligned these against the viral genome (Figure 2). Using
the aligned reads, I generated transcript models using stringtie, which identified multiple spliced
species that aligned with the TRS-L templated events (Figure 2). TRS-L transcripts aligned to the
genes S, ORF3a, ORF7a and N. The S transcript also presented with a short deletion of 36 bases.
Also, TRS independent spliced transcripts were identified. Non-canonical transcripts spliced from
ORF1ab 7016 onto ORF1ab 19560 and from ORF1ab 7278 onto N at base 29189. The dominant
ORF1-N fusion product (bases 7,278 to 29,189) is predicted to have an open reading frame for
part of ORF1ab that includes the leader protein (nsp1), nsp2 and approximately 77% of nsp3. For
nsp3, this would create the near full-length protein, including the nucleic acid-binding domain
(NAR), but would remove the transmembrane domain. The fused N gene is out-of-frame and
would not create a protein product. This same ORF1ab-N fusion was previously reported by one
other group as one of the non-canonical sgmRNA species in SARS-CoV-2(Kim et al., 2020).
The stringtie quantification of the predicted spliced products showed that relative transcripts
abundance of TRS dependent was 92.7% while the TRS independent was 7.3%. Of the TRS
independent sgmRNAs, the ORF1ab-N spliced product represented 6.6% of the predicted spliced
RNA, which was the fourth most abundant of the 8 predicted sgmRNA species, more than several
of the TRS-dependent sgmRNAs. While this finding represents an approximately four times higher
detection of TRS independent sgmRNAs than previously reported, the methods of quantification
in these two studies are not directly comparable, challenging the determination of the relative
abundance. Another caveat is that stringtie uses mammalian splicing rules that would not follow
in the splicing of viral RNA that uses a template switch process.
To better identify possible sgmRNA that may be independent of poly-A, split reads aligned to the
viral genome were extracted and quantified (Table 1). Using this metric, TRS dependent sgmRNAs
that spliced the 5’TRS-L onto TRS-B sequences upstream of viral genes represented only 56% of
the reads and matched the genes S, ORF3a, E, M, ORF7a, ORF8 and N, identifying multiple TRS

dependent spliced products missed by stringtie. Moreover, TRS independent reads were
identified with multiple sgmRNSAs mapping from six different regions of ORF1ab into two regions
of the N gene (Table 1).
To explore if TRS independent transcripts are common in other human CoV pathogens, I assessed
SARS-CoV(Josset et al., 2014; Xiong et al., 2014) and MERS (Data: PRJNA233943; publication not
known) using previously published polyA independent RNA sequencing data sets that also used
ribosome depletion of total RNA. For SARS-CoV, I observed that TRS dependent split junctions
represented 63% of all mapped split reads (Figure 2 and Table 2). This is similar to my
observations of SARS-CoV-2, indicating that TRS independent splicing is abundant and likely not
polyadenylated. Significantly the ORF1ab-N fusion products were also observed in SARS-CoV but
at lower levels (Table 2). In the MERS virus, the TRS independent split read events represented
13.7% of all split reads (data not shown), indicating a higher prevalence of TRS dependent
sgmRNAs compared to both of the SARS-CoV.

CoV regulatory sequences for sgmRNA production
To identify those splice variants driven by the TRS, I scanned the SARS-CoV-2 genome for exact
matches to the TRS motif (ACGAAC) and displayed matching locations along with the position of
coding regions and splice junctions (Figure 3 A-G). The TRS motif (Figure 3 C, D, F and G; red box)
was found upstream of the sgmRNA dependent genes (Figure 3 B-D; red arcs) that included the
genes S, Orf3a, E, M, Orf7a, Orf8 and N. The TRS sequence was never detected within the ORF1ab
gene locus. These findings are similar to previously annotated TRS locations
Each sgmRNA is expressed at different levels and may be driven by other regulatory elements.
As the SL2 conserved loop sequence is also known to be essential for viral sgmRNA, I scanned for
this sequence (Figure 3 C, D, F and G; blue box). For sgmRNA dependent genes, the SL2 pentaloop
sequence (UCUUGU) was discovered only near the 5’ region often near the TRS-B sequence. The
pentaloop sequence was also identified in multiple locations within the ORF1ab gene locus. The
TRS is located in the stem of SL3, but the loop sequence is also highly conserved in CoV species.
For these reasons, I next scanned the SARS-CoV-2 genome for matches SL3 (CUAAAC) loop

sequences (Figure 3 C, D, F and G; green box). A high correlation was noted in the presence of
SL3 sequences near the TRS sequence in the 5' region of sgmRNA dependent genes. As well,
multiple SL3 motifs were observed within the ORF1ab open reading frames. There was no
statistical relationship to the presence of SL2 or SL3 sequences and the level of sgmRNA
expression (data not shown).
To determine if the TRS, SL2 and SL3 are conserved to other CoV, I repeated the search for these
sequences motifs within the SARS-CoV genome (Figure 3 H-K). While the TRS and SL2 sequence
frequencies and locations were similar between the two SARS viruses (Figure 3 C, D, J and K), an
exception was that SARS-CoV had half the number of SL3 motifs in the ORF1ab open reading
frame compared with SARS-CoV-2 (Figure 3 C and J).
While the presence of an RNA sequence motifs was not sufficient to explain sgmRNA abundance,
regulatory motifs may need to be located on folded structures such as SL to be active. Next, I
assessed the folded structures within the TRS-B loci near sgmRNA of TRS dependent genes to
determine if structure and sequence were related to expression levels (Figure 4). While a
statistical inference is not possible, there was an interesting observation that the TRS-B within
the N gene locus folded to place the TRS, SL2 and SL3 sequences on two adjacent stems. N was
the only gene with this structure of the TRS-B/SL2/SL3. Only S and E were predicted to have the
TRS-B on a stem, but the SL2 and SL3 were unfolded. The SL2 sequence upstream of ORF3a and
M was predicted to be on a folded stem, but the associated TRS-B was not. Given that the N gene
is the most robustly expressed sgmRNA (4-20 fold higher), the folded structures containing all
three sequence elements may be a driver of high template switching.
A high level of unexpected splicing within the large ORF1ab gene was noted in multiple locations,
and all of these formed fusions within the N gene (Figure 3 E-G). No TRS was identified within the
ORF1ab locus or the N gene near the splice locations. However, within the ORF1ab locus, multiple
SL2 and SL3 sequences were identified, but these were not observed within the N gene. An
inspection of the ORF1ab splice regions with the N splice regions did identify a novel sequence
element (ATTGGC). Searching the SRAS-CoV-2 genome for this element revealed it to be present
at 4/6 ORF1ab splice starts, and both N splice ends, including the abundant ORF1ab (base 7,278)
to N gene (base 29,189) fusion sgmRNA (Figure 3 F and G; black boxes). The novel sequence was

also found near SL2 and SL3 motifs in the ORF1ab. Significantly, the novel motif was not observed
in the 5'UTR or near TRS-B sequences of genes. I called this motif the TRS independent regulatory
(TIR) motif.
Next, I searched for the TIR motif associated with TRS-independent sgmRNAs within the SARSCoV genome (Figure 3 L-N). I observed that the TIR sequence was identified in SARS-CoV at similar
locations, as observed in SARS-CoV-2 (Figure 3 F, G, M and N). The TIR sequence was found near
the splice locations of the in the ORF1ab-N fusion in SARS-CoV (Figure 3 M). This suggests a level
of conservation for the TIR motif. MERS showed poor conservation of the SL3 motif and the TIR
motif (data not shown).

Discussion
The TRS mechanism of sgmRNA generation is characterized in CoV species other than the two
SARS viruses. I show that the folded structure of the 5'-UTR of SARS-CoV-2 is predicted to be
similar to SARS-CoV and even MERS. The high conservation indicates that the TRS mechanism is
likely used in SARS-CoV-2. A recent report highlighted the presence of TRS independent sgmRNAs
and the role that methylation signalling may play in marking these transcripts. In this current
work, I draw attention to the possible difference in abundance of the TRS independent sgmRNAs
when using total versus poly-A enrichment for library construction. Many RNAs do not contain
poly-A sequences, specifically those that function as non-coding RNAs(Zhang et al., 2014). I
identified TRS-independent transcripts as more abundant in total RNA compared to poly-A RNA.
The lack of poly-A in TRS independent sgmRNAs suggests that they may function as non-coding
RNAs. Potential functions of the non-coding RNAs are to inhibit cellular antiviral responses or to
amplify the viral genome and sgmRNA by priming RNA-RNA interactions and the viral polymerase.
Methods such as stringtie performed poorly at identifying sgmRNAs, and instead use of split
reads gave better performance. Using the depth of reads mapped to the junctions provided
quantification of the abundance of TRS dependent and independent reads. Quantification of
junctions revealed that the SARS family of CoV had a higher abundance of the TRS independent
sgmRNAs compared to MERS.

Viral sgmRNA exist in different proportions that are relative to the protein's proportion needed
for viral particle assembly(Kim et al., 2020; Sola et al., 2015). These different stoichiometries may
indicate that there is a higher preference for some template switch regions leading to the
increased production of these sgmRNAs over others. To regulate the abundance of sgmRNA
transcripts, the TRS likely does not work alone in priming the template switch. To investigate
possible combinations of other regulatory motifs, I used the SL2 pentaloop and the SL3 loop
upstream of the TRS-L that are part of the 5'-UTR regulatory regions. I noted the presence of the
SL2 loop motif upstream of genes that generate sgmRNAs. I also found evidence of an expanded
TRS signal that includes the loop of stem-loop 3. While I found no evidence for a correlation of
motifs and expression levels, there did appear to be a relationship between the predicted folded
structures of the 5' regions of the viral gene and the regulatory sequences. This relationship was
most apparent for the N gene, where the TRS, SL2 and SL3 were all located on two different stems,
which was not an arrangement observed on the other viral genes. This folded arrangement may
increase the N gene's affinity for template switching to the 5'-UTR through higher affinity RNARNA interactions. Other regulatory RNA elements may be present that explain sgmRNA
abundance variation. Alternatively, variation in transcript stability may cause apparent
differential expression.
In a comparison of SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2, the SL2 and SL3 motifs are preferentially located
near TRS-B sequences and not interior to the open reading frames. The exception is ORF1ab, that
while lacking TRS motifs, had a high number of SL2 motifs in both species. Interestingly, the SL3
motif frequency was markedly reduced (>50%) within the ORF1ab region of SARS-CoV compared
to SARS-CoV-2.
Split reads also identified TRS-independent sgmRNAs. In support of my observations on SARSCoV-2, I also assessed SARS-CoV and MERs transcriptional data, two other human pathogenic
CoV. Significantly, all three of these viruses produce TRS independent transcripts, indicating that
this is a broader phenomenon of CoV and not species-specific. I also identified the TIR motif, a
novel sequence element (ATTGGC) flanking the spliced regions of TRS independent sgmRNAs in
both SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV. The novel sequence element is absent from the 5’UTR and near
TRS-B sequences. I observed that while SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV both expressed ORF1ab-N

fusions, SARS-CoV-2 had a higher level of expression relative to TRS dependent sgmRNAs.
Considering that fewer SL3 motifs were present in SARS-CoV relative to SARS-CoV-2, this suggests
that the SARS-CoV-2 virus may be evolving other regulation of sgmRNAs. While SARS-CoV and
SARS-CoV-2 are closely related, SARS-CoV-2 has infected more people in more counties. The
increased expression of the TRS-independent sgmRNAs may provide a selective advantage to
SARS-CoV-2 in human disease relative to SARS-CoV. Mutagenic studies are needed to validate
the TIR motif's role in TRS independent sgmRNA generation.
In conclusion, the novel regulatory sequence and confirmation of TRS independent sgmRNAs will
lead to an improved mechanistic understanding of sgmRNA production. The sgmRNA mechanism
could be drugged to inhibit viral transcription beyond targeting the polymerase.

Figure 1. Untranslated regions of human coronaviruses have common folded structures.
The first 130 bases of the SARS-CoV, SARS-CoV-2 and MERS genomes were folded using
RNAStructure and visualized using the R library RRNA function RNAPlot. The TRS-L and the
pentaloop region of SL2 are highlighted. In all cases, the regulatory TRS and pentaloop are on two
adjacent stem-loops, with the TRS located in the stem portion. A similar analysis of 350 bases of
the 3'UTR essential for viral replication and negative-strand transcript initiation shows more
diversity in predicted structures. The pseudoknot sequences are conserved in red and green.
Additionally, in all species, the poly-A region (blue) is predicted to be looped back to 5 prime
regions thought to be important in self-priming the viral RNA directed RNA polymerase.

Integrated genome viewer transcripts are shown. For both species, the top track is the gene

Peaks of alignment are observed for the 5’UTR leader, internal to the ORF1ab genes and the
beginning of S, ORF3a, E, M ORF7a and N as well as internal to N. Bottom track is the predicted
transcript from stringtie. Both SARS viruses have ORF1ab split reads aligning to ORF1ab and to

generation.

STAR methods
Viral sequences
All viral genome sequences were obtained from NCBI, SARS-CoV-2 NC_045512.2, SARS-CoV
NC_004718.3 and MERS NC_038294.1.

Alignments and sequence organization
All sequences were handled and processed in R using the biostrings package, including
conversion of DNA into RNA, reverse complementation, extraction of subsequences and motif
mapping. Related sequences were found using the NCBI BLAST tool(Johnson et al., 2008). Data
were visualized using ggplot2(Wickham, 2009).

RNA folding experiments were performed using the RNA structure web server and stand-alone
program(Mathews, 2014) using default conditions.

RNA-seq data processing
Data sets were obtained from the short read archive (SARS-CoV-2 GSE147507 (Blanco-Melo et
al., 2020); SARS-CoV PRJNA227801 (Josset et al., 2014; Xiong et al., 2014); MERS PRJNA233943
(Not linked to a pubmed article) ). These included all cell lines, human samples and animal models
infected with the virus. FASTQ files were deposited as processed files with adaptors trimmed and
poor-quality sequences removed and trimmed. The htseq2(Anders et al., 2014) program was
used to generate the viral reference genome and for alignments of the FASTQ files. Reads that
did not align with the viral genome were discarded. The setting for alignment included -data to
prepare for transcript assembly and reducing the non-canonical splice penalty to 0. Aligned reads
in sam format were converted into bam files using samtools. Bam files were sorted and indexed
using samtools. Reads that split and represented splicing were extracted by using the CIGAR
codes by an AWK command to select specific reads that were split. Aligned reads were visualized
in the Integrated Genome Viewer.

De novo transcript identification
Bam files were converted into FASTQ files using the bam2fastq function. Converted FASTQ files
were assembled into transcripts using stringtie. The gtf output files from stringtie were visualized
in IGV and extracted as a bed file with a 12 column format. The bed12 file was used to extract
the stranded fasta sequence from the reference genome. The NBCI ORF finder tool was used to
identify open reading frames in novel splice products.
Code availability
All code is available upon requires
