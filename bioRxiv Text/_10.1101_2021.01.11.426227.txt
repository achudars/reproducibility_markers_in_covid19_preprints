Abstract:
Spike protein of human coronaviruses has been a vital drug and vaccine target. The
multifunctionality of this protein including host receptor binding and apoptosis has been proved
in several coronaviruses. It also interacts with other viral proteins such as membrane (M) protein
through its C-terminal domain. The specific dibasic motif signal present in cytosolic region at Cterminal of spike protein helps it to localize within the endoplasmic reticulum (ER). However,
the structural conformation of cytosolic region is not known in SARS-CoV-2 using which it
interacts with other proteins and transporting vesicles. Therefore, we have demonstrated the
conformation of cytosolic region and its dynamics through computer simulations up to
microsecond timescale using OPLS and CHARMM forcefields. The simulations have revealed
the unstructured conformation of cytosolic region (residues 1242-1273). Also, in temperature
dependent replica-exchange molecular dynamics simulations it has shown to form secondary
structures. We believe that our findings will surely help us understand the structure-function
relationship of the spike protein's cytosolic region.

The importance of coronavirus spike protein is apparent from it surface-exposed location,
rendering it a prime target after viral infection for cell-mediated and humoral immune responses
as well as artificially designed vaccines and antiviral therapeutics. The SARS-CoV-2 homotrimeric spike glycoprotein consists of an extracellular unit anchored by a transmembrane (TM)
domain in viral membrane and a cytoplasmic domain (1). It is secreted as monomeric 1273
amino acid long protein from endoplasmic reticulum (ER) shortly after which it trimerizes to
facilitate the transport to the Golgi complex (2, 3). Moreover, N-linked high mannose
oligosaccharide side chains that are added to spike monomer in ER are further modified in Golgi
compartments (2).
Spike protein comprises two independent subunits S1 and S2 that are associated through
noncovalent interactions in a metastable prefusion state. During maturation in the trans-Golgi
network, spike is cleaved by furin or furin-like host proteases at S1/S2 cleavage site yielding the
two unequal subunits (4, 5). The distal S1 subunit (residues 14–685) contains a N-terminal
domain, a C-terminal domain, and two subdomains (Figure 1). The C-terminal domain is the
receptor-binding domain or RBD, has a receptor-binding motif (RBM) which interacts with
human angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE2), chief target receptor of SARS-CoV-2 on
human cells (6). RBM is present as an extended loop insertion which binds to bottom side of the
small lobe of ACE2 receptor. RBD further consists of two subdomains: an external and a core
subdomain which engages with the target receptor (2, 7). Several detailed crystallographic
structures of SARS-CoV-2 RBD in complex with ACE2 are available on protein data bank
revealing the network of key hydrophilic interactions (6, 8). The S2 subunit (residues 686-1273)
has a hydrophobic fusion peptide, two heptad repeats, a transmembrane domain, and a
cytoplasmic C-terminal tail (Figure 1). After virus attachment on host cellular membrane, S2
subunit enclosing a fusion machinery mediates the fusion of host cell and viral membranes (2, 9).
It has been reported in SARS-CoV that the C-terminal domain or S2 subunit of spike induces
apoptosis in Vero E6 cells in a dose and time dependent manner (10).

and closed states, transmembrane domain, and cytoplasmic C-terminal tail (based on UniProt
database).

As of yet, cytoplasmic domain of spike protein is the least explored region despite of
such extensive research in pandemic times. It is of particular importance as it contains a
conserved ER retrieval signal (KKXX) (11). In SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 spike proteins, a
novel dibasic KLHYT (KXHXX) motif present at extreme ends of the C-terminus plays a crucial
role in its subcellular localization (12–14). Also, deletions in cytoplasmic domain of coronavirus
spike are implicated in viral infection in recent reports (15–18). SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2
spike having a deletion of last ~20 residues displayed increased infectivity of single-cycle
vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV)-S pseudotypes (15, 16). Contrarily, short truncations of
cytoplasmic domain of MHV spike protein (△12 and △25) had limited effect on viral infectivity
while the long truncation of 35 residues interfered with both viral-host cell membrane fusion and
assembly. Importantly, it is also shown to interact with the membrane protein inside host cells
(17). In our previous report, the cytoplasmic tail is predicted to be a MoRF (Molecular
Recognition Feature) region (residues 1265-1273) by a predictor MoRFchibi (14). The MoRF

regions in proteins are disorder-based binding regions that contribute to DNA, RNA, and other
proteins. In the same report, it is also found to contain many DNA and RNA binding residues.
We aimed to understand the cytoplasmic domain (1242-1273 residues) of the SARSCoV-2 spike protein to gain further insights. To this end, we computationally analyzed its
behavioral dynamics using molecular dynamic (MD) simulations up to one microsecond (µs)
using our in-house facility. This report's outcomes will help understand this domain's structure
and function and provide an idea to explore the interaction of spike protein with other viral and
host proteins.

Material and Methods
Transmembrane prediction: Before studying the cytoplasmic domain, we have applied
multiple servers to predict the spike protein's transmembrane region. TMHMM (19), TMPred
(20), SPLIT (21), PSIPRED (22, 23), and CCTOP (24) web predictors works using highly
optimized and least biased algorithms which also takes into account the homology of sequences.
Among the aforementioned predictors, CCTOP predicts the transmembrane regions based on the
consensus of multiple predictors and experimental derived structural information from
homologous proteins in the database. Therefore, it provides a better understanding and
identification of transmembrane regions in the protein. Based on CCTOP prediction, we have
chosen the C-terminal cytoplasmic tail region to elucidate its structural dynamics.
Disorder Prediction: The propensity of disorderedness in spike C-terminal cytoplasmic tail
region is predicted using PONDR family (25–27), IUPred long (28), and PrDOS (29) servers. The
detailed methodology is given in our previous reports (14, 30).
Structure Modelling: PEP-FOLD 3.5 webserver (31) is used to predict 3D structures of selected
spike protein regions. By implementing optimized potential for efficient structure prediction
(OPEP) coarse-grained forcefield-based simulations, an improved and minimized structure is
obtained as described earlier (32–34). Then, the structure is prepared in Schrodinger suite where
the missing hydrogens, improper bond orders, and protonation states are corrected. Further, the
prepared structure is used for MD simulations.
Molecular Dynamic (MD) Simulations: To comprehend and comparable outcomes for
intrinsically disordered regions, we used two different forcefields to analyze the structural
dynamics of the cytosolic domain of spike protein.

Simulation with OPLS 2005
We used Desmond simulations package, where simulation setup is built by placing the protein
structure in an orthorhombic box along with TIP3P water model, 0.15M NaCl salt concentration
(35). After solvation, the system is charge neutralized with counterions using OPLS 2005
forcefield. To attain an energy minimized simulation system, the steepest descent method is used
for 5000 iterations. Further, the equilibration of system is done to optimize solvent in the
environment. Using NVT and NPT ensembles within periodic boundary conditions, the system is
equilibrated for 100 ps each. The average temperature at 300K and pressure at 1 bar are
maintained using Nose-Hoover and Martyna-Tobias-Klein (MTK) coupling methods during
simulation (36, 37). All bond-related constraints are solved using SHAKE algorithm, and
hydrogen bond constraints were solved using LINCS algorithm (38). The final production run is
performed for 1 µs using our in-house facilities.
Simulation with CHARMM36m
Another forcefield we used, CHARMM36m in Gromacs, is an improved version of
CHARMM36, which is effectively developed for analyzing IDP regions in the proteins in
significant simulation timescale (39, 40). Using TIP3P water model and salt, the system is
prepared for proper electrostatic distribution and then neutralized for charge using counterion (1
Na+ ion in this case). The energy minimization of simulation setup using steepest descent
method is done for 50,000 steps. For temperature and pressure coupling, the V-rescale and
Parrinello-Rahman algorithms are used where 300K and 1 bar is the average temperature and
pressure respectively. After equilibration of 100 ps for NVT and NPT methods, the production
run is then executed for 1 µs using our high performing cluster at IIT Mandi.
Replica-Exchange Molecular Dynamic (REMD) simulations
The enhanced conformation sampling using REMD simulations is widespread in protein folding.
During REMD simulations, the swapping of conformations occurs and reduces the chances of
entrapping simulations in local minimum energy states (41). Therefore, we have performed
REMD using eight replicas (numbered from 0 to 7) at temperatures 298 K, 314 K, 330 K, 346 K,
362 K, 378 K, 394 K, and 410 K, calculated by linear mode of Desmond. The last frame of 1 µs
of Desmond simulation trajectory is chosen as the initial conformation for REMD. The
multigrator integrator of Langevin and Nose-Hoover as thermostats, whereas Langevin and

Martyna-Tobias-Klein (MTK) are used to equilibrate the systems. The accountability of
conformation swaps to be accepted or rejected is done based on common Metropolis criterion
using the following equation:
Q = (β1U11 + β2U22 − β1U12 − β2U21) + (β1P1 − β2P2) (V1 − V2)
Where Uij = potential energy of replica i in the Hamiltonian of replica j,
Pi = the reference pressure of replica i,
Vi = instantaneous volume of replica i, and
βi = the inverse reference temperature of replica i.

If Q > 0 = accept, or Q < −20 = reject the exchange,
else accept the exchange if randN < exp(Q), where randN is a random variable on (0,1).

Results
In recent times, computational approaches have been widely used to explore the secondary and
tertiary structures of proteins and small peptides. It has immensely helped a lot in the ongoing
COVID-19 pandemic to study structural conformations of protein and their interacting partners,
i.e., protein, ligands, glycans, etc. Molecular dynamics simulation is an useful approach to
answer such questions at the atomic level. Herein, we have studied the transmembrane region
and performed rigorous simulations to unravel the least explored cytoplasmic domain of essential
spike protein.

Transmembrane region analysis:
The sequence-based analysis of transmembrane region and disorder prone regions have also been
analyzed. The subcellular localization of spike protein occurs in the extracellular,
transmembrane, and cytoplasmic regions (42). However, based on SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2
proteins' sequence alignment, approximately 77% similarity is found among both viruses' spike
proteins (14). The C-terminal has shown high similarity and conserved regions, while the Nterminal has vastly varying residues.
Based on multiple predictors used in this study, spike protein's transmembrane region lies within
1213-1246 residues (Figure 2). A consensus-based server, CCTOP, has predicted the

Disorder prediction
In our recent study, we have identified the disordered and disorder-based binding regions in
SARS-CoV-2 where the cytoplasmic domain at C-terminal of spike protein is found to be
disordered (14). Again, we analyzed the disorderedness in selected cytoplasmic region using
multiple predictors, including PONDR family, IUPred long, and PrDOS predictors. Out of six
predictors, three predictors from PONDR family have predicted it as highly disordered, PrDOS
has predicted it as moderately disordered. In contrast, PONDR FIT and IUPred long predicted it
as least disordered (Figure 3).

Structure modelling with PEPFOLD3
In absence of an experimentally determined 3D structure of protein, structure modeling provides
an approximate structure model based on homology and properties of amino acids using a wide
range of optimized algorithms. It generates the prototype fragments and assembles them by
implementing optimized potential for efficient structure prediction (OPEP) coarse-grained
forcefield-based simulations. The best-obtained structure of extreme C-terminus tail (1242-1273
amino acids) containing two small helical regions is further prepared for MD simulations in
aqueous conditions. These helical regions are present at residues

Simulation with OPLS 2005
In the last three decades, many advancements have been made in forcefields and hardware
related to MD simulation to match the experimental events. Long MD simulations up to
microseconds or milliseconds are incredibly insightful to study structural conformations
occurring at the nanoscale level. We have recently explored various regions of different SARS-

Simulation with CHARMM36m
The characterization of intrinsically disordered proteins (IDPs) and regions (IDPRs) using MD
simulations is very well persistent in literature. In last two decades, several forcefields for MD
simulations are developed and improved at times. All forcefields have their advantages and
limitations due to the proper evaluation of secondary structure composition. Here, we have used
another forcefield, CHARMM36m, for determining the conformational dynamics of spike
cytosolic region. As shown through trajectory snapshots at every 100 ns in figure 6, the cytosolic
region has adopted a β-sheet conformation at its N-terminal. Two β-strands can be seen with
varying amino acid length at every 0.1 µs frame. The only exceptions are 0.3 µs and 0.4 µs
frames, which do not show any secondary structure. Further, after 0.5 µs frame, a gradual loss in
two β-strands indicates a gain in disorder content in spike C-terminus. To this end, the 1 µs
simulation frame comprises of only a short β-strand and rest unstructured residues.
These structural changes have been the reason for immensely varying atomic distances
throughout the simulation. Likewise, RMSD values are found in a range of approx. 0.75 nm to
1.75 nm (Figure 7A); the mean residual fluctuations are in the range of 0.5 nm to 1.1 nm
(Figure 7C), and the Rg values vary up to 2.4 nm (Figure 7B), which demonstrates the vastly
changing structural compactness. The timeline representation of secondary structure composition
at each frame also depicts the structural inconsistency throughout the simulation (Figure 7D).
Convincingly, a major part of spike cytosolic region is disordered and might have the propensity
to gain structure in physiological conditions.

retention signals where it mediates cell fusion to spread infection (44). This is seen in some
coronaviruses where the cytoplasmic domain with transmembrane domain embed spike protein
in viral lipid envelope (17). Our recent report on protein-protein interactions of SARS-CoV-2
structural proteins have also demonstrated that the C-terminal domain or S2 subunit of spike
protein interacts with M protein (46). In protein-protein docking and MD based study, it is
revealed that the residues of spike protein Asp796, Lys921, Asn925, Tyr1209, Cys1241, and
Cys1247 interacts with Trp31, Tyr39, Phe53, Trp55, and Trp58 residues of M protein through
stable intermolecular bonds (46).
Our study on the structural dynamics of SARS-CoV-2 spike cytoplasmic domain
demonstrates it to be a disordered region. Based on the outcomes of two forcefields, OPLS 2005
and CHARMM36m, spike cytosolic region remains majorly unstructured. Nevertheless, in
REMD simulations, it adopted β-sheets at rising temperatures with time demonstrating its gain of
structure-property. Generally, an IDPR gains any structure upon interacting with its interacting
partner or in physiological conditions (47). In unstructured state, cytoplasmic domain may
function as a MoRF to bind with COP1 coated transporting vesicles, which localizes spike
protein into ER. As described earlier, the interaction of C-terminal domain of spike protein is
reported with other structural proteins like M, which is highly likely to occur in its disordered
form with extended radius.

Conclusion
The advancement in computational powers and excessive improvements in forcefields have
empowered structural biology. Newly developed algorithms and their user-friendly approach
allow correlating the outcomes with experimental observations. In this article, we have identified
the transmembrane region in spike protein by employing distinguished web predictors. This
cleared the composition of amino acids forming cytoplasmic domain. Further, the secondary
structure and disorder predisposition analysis demonstrated it to be highly disordered. We have
demonstrated the structural conformation of cytoplasmic domain (1242-1273 residues) of spike
protein at a microsecond timescale using computational simulations. As revealed, this domain is
purely unstructured or disordered after one microsecond and have not gained any structural
conformation throughout the simulation period. Our results are in good correlation with
previously published studies on coronaviruses. Based on our previous study (14), cytoplasmic

tail of spike glycoprotein has molecular recognition features therein. In this manuscript, the
multiple conformations during the simulation process adds up to even more interesting
speculations.
