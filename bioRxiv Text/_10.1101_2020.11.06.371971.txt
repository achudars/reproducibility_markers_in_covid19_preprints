Abstract

33

The ongoing global pandemic caused by the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2

34

(SARS-CoV-2) is responsible for the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) first described from

35

Wuhan, China. A subset of COVID-19 patients has been reported to have acquired secondary

36

infections by microbial pathogens, such as fungal opportunistic pathogens from the genus

37

Aspergillus. To gain insight into COVID-19 associated pulmonary aspergillosis (CAPA), we

38

analyzed the genomes and characterized the phenotypic profiles of four CAPA isolates of

39

Aspergillus fumigatus obtained from patients treated in the area of North Rhine-Westphalia,

40

Germany. By examining the mutational spectrum of single nucleotide polymorphisms, insertion-

41

deletion polymorphisms, and copy number variants among 206 genes known to modulate A.

42

fumigatus virulence, we found that CAPA isolate genomes do not exhibit major differences from

43

the genome of the Af293 reference strain. By examining virulence in an invertebrate moth

44

model, growth in the presence of osmotic, cell wall, and oxidative stressors, and the minimum

45

inhibitory concentration of antifungal drugs, we found that CAPA isolates were generally, but

46

not always, similar to A. fumigatus reference strains Af293 and CEA17. Notably, CAPA isolate

47

D had more putative loss of function mutations in genes known to increase virulence when

48

deleted (e.g., in the FLEA gene, which encodes a lectin recognized by macrophages). Moreover,

49

CAPA isolate D was significantly more virulent than the other three CAPA isolates and the A.

50

fumigatus reference strains tested. These findings expand our understanding of the genomic and

51

phenotypic characteristics of isolates that cause CAPA.

Introduction

57

On March 11, 2020, the World Health Organization declared the ongoing pandemic caused by

58

SARS-CoV-2, which causes COVID-19, a global emergency (Sohrabi et al., 2020). Similar to

59

other viral infections, patients may be more susceptible to microbial secondary infections, which

60

can complicate disease management strategies and result in adverse patient outcomes

61

(Brüggemann et al., 2020; Cox et al., 2020). For example, approximately one quarter of patients

62

infected with the H1N1 influenza virus during the 2009 pandemic were also infected with

63

bacteria or fungi (MacIntyre et al., 2018; Zhou et al., 2020). Among studies examining patients

64

with COVID-19, ~17% of individuals also have bacterial infections (Langford et al., 2020) and

65

one study found that ~40% of patients with severe COVID-19 pneumonia were also infected

66

with filamentous fungi from the genus Aspergillus (Nasir et al., 2020). Another study reported

67

that ~26% of patients with acute respiratory distress syndrome-associated COVID-19 were also

68

infected with Aspergillus fumigatus and had high rates of mortality (Koehler et al., 2020).

69

Despite the prevalence microbial infections and their association with adverse patient outcomes,

70

these secondary infections are only beginning to be understood.

71
72

Invasive pulmonary aspergillosis is caused by tissue infiltration of Aspergilli after inhalation of

73

asexual spores (Figure 1); more than 250,000 aspergillosis infections are estimated to occur

74

annually and have high mortality rates (Bongomin et al., 2017). The major etiological agent of

75

aspergillosis is A. fumigatus (Latgé and Chamilos, 2019), although a few other Aspergillus

76

species are also known to cause aspergillosis (Bastos et al., 2020; dos Santos et al., 2020b; Rokas

77

et al., 2020; Steenwyk et al., 2020c). Numerous factors are known to be associated with A.

78

fumigatus pathogenicity, including its ability to grow at the human body temperature (37°C) and

79

withstand oxidative stress (Kamei and Watanabe, 2005; Tekaia and Latgé, 2005; Shwab et al.,

80

2007; Losada et al., 2009; Abad et al., 2010; Grahl et al., 2012; Yin et al., 2013; Wiemann et al.,

81

2014; Knox et al., 2016; Kowalski et al., 2019; Raffa and Keller, 2019; Blachowicz et al., 2020).

82

Disease management of A. fumigatus is further complicated by resistance to antifungal drugs

83

among strains (Chamilos and Kontoyiannis, 2005; Howard and Arendrup, 2011; Chowdhary et

84

al., 2014; Sewell et al., 2019) Additionally, A. fumigatus strains have been previously shown to

85

exhibit strain heterogeneity with respect to virulence and pathogenicity-associated traits

86

(Kowalski et al., 2016; Keller, 2017; Kowalski et al., 2019; Ries et al., 2019; dos Santos et al.,

87

2020b; Steenwyk et al., 2020d). However, it remains unclear whether the genomic and

88

pathogenicity-related phenotypic characteristics of CAPA isolates are similar or distinct from

89

those of previously studied clinical strains of A. fumigatus.

90
91

To address this question and gain insight into the pathobiology of A. fumigatus CAPA isolates,

92

we examined the genomic and phenotypic characteristics of four CAPA isolates obtained from

93

four critically ill patients of two different centers in Cologne, Germany (Koehler et al., 2020)

94

(Table 1). All patients were submitted to intensive care units due to moderate to severe

95

respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). Genome-scale phylogenetic (or phylogenomic) analyses

96

revealed CAPA isolates formed a monophyletic group closely related to reference strains Af293

97

and A1163. Examination of the mutational spectra of 206 genes known to modulate virulence in

98

A. fumigatus (which are hereafter referred to as genetic determinants of virulence) revealed

99

several putative loss of function (LOF) mutations. Notably, CAPA isolate D had the most

100

putative LOF mutations among genes whose null mutants are known to increase virulence. The

101

profiles of pathogenicity-related traits of the CAPA isolates were similar to those of reference A.

102

fumigatus strains Af293 and CEA17. One notable exception was that CAPA isolate D was

103

significantly more virulent than other strains in an invertebrate model of disease. These results

104

suggest that the genomes of A. fumigatus CAPA isolates contain nearly complete and intact

105

repertoires of genetic determinants of virulence and have phenotypic profiles that are broadly

106

expected for A. fumigatus clinical isolates. However, we did find evidence for genetic and

107

phenotypic strain heterogeneity. These results suggest the CAPA isolates show similar virulence

108

profiles as A. fumigatus clinical strains Af293 and A1163 and expand our understanding of

109

CAPA.

110
111

Results and Discussion

112

CAPA isolates belong to A. fumigatus and are closely related to reference strains Af293 and

113

A1163

114

To confirm that the CAPA isolates belong to A. fumigatus, we sequenced, assembled, and

115

annotated their genomes (Table S1). Phylogenetic analyses conducted using tef1 (Figure S1) and

116

calmodulin (Figure S2) sequences suggested that all CAPA isolates are A. fumigatus.

A. fumigatus genomes including strains Af293 and A1163 (Nierman et al., 2005; Fedorova et al.,

121

oerlinghausenensis strain CBS 139183T (Fedorova et al., 2008; Steenwyk et al., 2020d))

122

confirmed that all CAPA isolates are A. fumigatus (Figure 2A). Phylogenomic analyses also

123

revealed the CAPA isolates formed a monophyletic group closely related to reference strains

124

Af293 and A1163.

125
126

CAPA isolate genomes contain polymorphisms in genetic determinants of virulence and

127

biosynthetic gene clusters

128

Sequence similarity searches of gene sequences present in a curated list of 206 genetic

129

determinants of virulence previously identified in A. fumigatus (File S1) (Abad et al., 2010;

130

Bignell et al., 2016; Kjærbølling et al., 2018; Mead et al., 2019; Urban et al., 2019) showed that

131

all 206 genes were present in the genomes of the CAPA isolates. Furthermore, none of the 206

132

genetic determinants of virulence showed any copy number variation among CAPA isolates.

133

Examination of single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) and insertion/deletion (indel)

134

polymorphisms coupled with variant effect prediction in these 206 genes (Figure 2B; File S2)

135

showed that all CAPA isolates shared multiple polymorphisms resulting in early stop codons or

136

frameshift mutations suggestive of loss of function (LOF) in NRPS8 (AFUA_5G12730), a

137

nonribosomal peptide synthetase gene that encodes an unknown secondary metabolite (Lind et

138

al., 2017). LOF mutations in NRPS8 are known to result in increased virulence in a mouse model

139

of disease (O’Hanlon et al., 2011). Putative LOF mutations were also observed in genes whose

140

null mutants decreased virulence. For example, all CAPA isolates shared the same SNPs

141

resulting in early stop codons that likely result in LOF in PPTA (AFUA_2G08590), a putative

142

4’-phosphopantetheinyl transferase, whose deletion results in reduced virulence in a mouse

143

model of disease (Johns et al., 2017). In light of the close evolutionary relationships among

144

CAPA isolates, we hypothesize that these shared mutations likely occurred in the genome of

145

their most recent common ancestor.

146
147

In addition to shared polymorphisms, analyses of CAPA isolate genomes also revealed isolate-

148

specific polymorphisms affecting genetic determinants of virulence (File S2). For example,
5

149

SNPs resulting in early stop codons, which likely lead to LOF, were observed in CYP5081A1

150

(AFUA_4G14780), a putative cytochrome P450 monooxygenase, in CAPA isolates B and C.

151

CYP5081A1 LOF is associated with reduced virulence of A. fumigatus (Mitsuguchi et al., 2009).

152

Additionally, a mutation resulting in the loss of the start codon was observed in FLEA

153

(AFUA_5G14740), a gene that encodes an L-fucose-specific lectin, in only CAPA isolate D.

154

Notably, mice infected with FLEA null mutants have more severe pneumonia and invasive

155

aspergillosis than wild-type strains. FLEA null mutants cause more severe disease because FleA

156

binds to macrophages and therefore is critical for host recognition, clearance, and macrophage

157

killing (Kerr et al., 2016). Most notably, CAPA isolate D had the most putative LOF mutations

158

in the subset of the 206 genetic determinants whose null mutants result in increased virulence,

159

which raises the hypothesis that CAPA isolate D is more virulent than the other CAPA isolates.

160
161

Examination of the presence of biosynthetic gene clusters (BGCs) revealed that all CAPA

162

isolates had BGCs that encode secondary metabolites known to modulate host biology (Table 2).

163

For example, all CAPA isolates had BGCs encoding the toxic secondary metabolite gliotoxin

164

(Figure 3). Other intact BGCs in the genomes of the CAPA isolates include fumitremorgin,

165

trypacidin, pseurotin, and fumagillin, which are known to modulate host biology (Ishikawa et al.,

166

2009; González-Lobato et al., 2010; Gauthier et al., 2012); for example, fumagillin is known to

167

inhibit neutrophil function (Fallon et al., 2010, 2011). More broadly, all CAPA isolates had

168

similar numbers and classes of BGCs (Figure S3).

169
170

In summary, we found that CAPA isolates were closely related to one another and had largely

171

intact genetic determinants of virulence and BGCs. However, we observed strain specific

172

polymorphisms in known genetic determinants of virulence in CAPA isolate genomes, which

173

raises the hypothesis that CAPA isolates differ in their virulence profiles.

174
175

CAPA isolates display strain heterogeneity in virulence but not in virulence-related traits

176

Examination of virulence and virulence-related traits revealed the CAPA isolates often, but not

177

always, had similar phenotypic profiles compared to reference A. fumigatus strains Af293 and

178

CEA17 (which is a pyrG mutant derived from the reference strain A1163 (Bertuzzi et al., 2020)).

179

For example, virulence in the Galleria moth model of fungal disease revealed strain

180

heterogeneity among CAPA isolates, Af293, and CEA17 (p < 0.001; log-rank test; Figure 4A).

181

Pairwise examination revealed that the observed strain heterogeneity was primarily driven by

182

CAPA isolate D, which was significantly more virulent than all other CAPA isolates (Benjamini-

183

Hochberg adjusted p-value < 0.01 when comparing CAPA isolate D to another isolate; log-rank

184

test; File S3). Also, CAPA isolate C was significantly more virulent than reference strain Af293

185

(Benjamini-Hochberg adjusted p-value = 0.01; log-rank test). These results reveal that the CAPA

186

isolates have generally similar virulence profiles compared to the reference strains Af293 and

187

CEA17 with the exception of the more virulent CAPA isolate D.

188
189

Examination of growth in the presence of osmotic, cell wall, and oxidative stressors revealed that

190

CAPA isolates had similar phenotypic profiles compared to Af293 and CEA17 (Figures 4B-D

191

and S4) with one exception. Specifically, across all growth assays, we observed significant

192

differences between the CAPA isolates and the reference strains Af293 and CEA17 (p < 0.001;

193

multi-factor ANOVA). Pairwise comparisons revealed significant differences were driven by

194

growth in the presence of calcofluor white wherein the CAPA isolates were more sensitive than

195

reference strains Af293 and CEA17 (p < 0.001; Tukey's Honest Significant Difference test;

196

Figure 4C). Lastly, antifungal drug susceptibility profiles for amphotericin B, voriconazole,

197

itraconazole, and posaconazole were similar between the CAPA isolates and reference strains

198

Af293 and CEA17 (Table 3).

199
200

In summary, we found that the CAPA isolates have similar phenotypic profiles compared to

201

reference strains Af293 and CEA17with the exception of growth in the presence of calcofluor

202

white and the greater virulence of CAPA isolate D. The higher levels of virulence observed in

203

CAPA isolate D may be associated with a greater number of putative LOF mutations that are

204

known to increase virulence; however, this hypothesis requires further functional testing.

205
206

Concluding remarks

207

The effects of secondary fungal infections in COVID-19 patients are only beginning to be

208

understood. Our results revealed that CAPA isolates are generally, but not always, similar to A.

209

fumigatus clinical reference strains. Notably, CAPA isolate D was significantly more virulent

210

than the other three CAPA isolates and two reference strains examined. We hypothesize that this

211

difference is because the D isolate contains more putative LOF mutations in genetic determinants

212

of virulence whose null mutants are known to increase virulence than other strains. Taken

213

together, these results are important to consider in the management of fungal infections among

214

patients with COVID-19, especially those infected with A. fumigatus, and broaden our

215

understanding of CAPA.

216
217

Methods

218

Patient information and ethics approval

219

Patients were included into the FungiScope® global registry for emerging invasive fungal

220

infections (www.ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT 01731353). The clinical trial is approved by the Ethics

221

Committee of the University of Cologne, Cologne, Germany (Study ID: 05-102) (Seidel et al.,

222

2017). Since 2019, patients with invasive aspergillosis are also included.

223
224

DNA quality control, library preparation, and sequencing

225

Sample DNA concentration was measured by Qubit fluorometer and DNA integrity and purity

226

by agarose gel electrophoresis. For each sample, 1-1.5μg genomic DNA was randomly

227

fragmented by Covaris and fragments with average size of 200-400bp were selected by

228

Agencourt AMPure XP-Medium kit. The selected fragments were end-repaired, 3’ adenylated,

229

adapters-ligated, and amplified by PCR. Double-stranded PCR products were recovered by the

230

AxyPrep Mag PCR clean up Kit, and then heat denatured and circularized by using the splint

231

oligo sequence. The single-strand circle DNA (ssCir DNA) products were formatted as the final

232

library and went through further QC procedures. The libraries were sequenced on the

233

MGISEQ2000 platform.

234
235

Genome assembly and annotations

236

Short-read sequencing data of each sample were assembled using MaSuRCA, v3.4.1 (Zimin et

237

al., 2013). Each de novo genome assembly was annotated using the MAKER genome annotation

238

pipeline, v2.31.11 (Holt and Yandell, 2011), which integrates three ab initio gene predictors:

239

AUGUSTUS, v3.3.3 (Stanke and Waack, 2003), GeneMark-ES, v4.59 (Besemer and

240

Borodovsky, 2005), and SNAP, v2013-11-29 (Korf, 2004). Fungal protein sequences in the

241

SwissProt database (release 2020_02) were used as homology evidence for the genome

242

annotation. The MAKER annotation process occurs in an iterative manner as described

243

previously (Shen et al., 2018). In brief, for each genome, repeats were first soft-masked using

244

RepeatMasker v4.1.0 (http://www.repeatmasker.org) with the library Repbase library release-

245

20181026 and the “-species” parameter set to “Aspergillus fumigatus”. GeneMark-ES was then

246

trained on the masked genome sequence using the self-training option (“--ES”) and the branch

247

model algorithm (“--fungus”), which is optimal for fungal genome annotation. On the other

248

hand, an initial MAKER analysis was carried out where gene annotations were generated directly

249

from homology evidence, and the resulting gene models were used to train both AUGUSTUS

250

and SNAP. Once trained, the ab initio predictors were used together with homology evidence to

251

conduct a first round of full MAKER analysis. Resulting gene models supported by homology

252

evidence were used to re-train AUGUSTUS and SNAP. A second round of MAKER analysis

253

was conducted using the newly trained AUGUSTUS and SNAP parameters, and once again the

254

resulting gene models with homology supports were used to re-train AUGUSTUS and SNAP.

255

Finally, a third round of MAKER analysis was performed using the new AUGUSTUS and

256

SNAP parameters to generate the final set of annotations for the genome. The completeness of de

257

novo genome assemblies and ab initio gene predictions was assessed using BUSCO, v4.1.2

258

(Waterhouse et al., 2018) using 4,191 pre-selected ‘nearly’ universally single-copy orthologous

259

genes from the Eurotiales database (eurotials_odb10.2019-11-20) in OrthoDB, v10.1

260

(Waterhouse et al., 2013).

261
262

Polymorphism identification

263

To characterize and examine the putative impact of polymorphisms in the genomes of the CAPA

264

isolates, we identified single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs), insertion-deletion

265

polymorphisms (indels), and copy number (CN) polymorphisms. To do so, reads were first

266

quality-trimmed and mapped to the genome of A. fumigatus Af293 (RefSeq assembly accession:

267

GCF_000002655.1) following a previously established protocol (Steenwyk and Rokas, 2017).

268

Specifically, reads were first quality-trimmed with Trimmomatic, v0.36 (Bolger et al., 2014),

269

using the parameters leading:10, trailing:10, slidingwindow:4:20, minlen:50. The resulting

270

quality-trimmed reads were mapped to the A. fumigatus Af293 genome using the Burrows-

271

Wheeler Aligner (BWA), v0.7.17 (Li, 2013), with the mem parameter. Thereafter, mapped reads

were converted to a sorted bam and mpileup format for polymorphism identification using

273

SAMtools, v.1.3.1 (Li et al., 2009).

274
275

To identify SNPs and indels, mpileup files were used as input into VarScan, v2.3.9 (Koboldt et

276

al., 2012), with the mpileup2snp and mpileup2indel functions, respectively. To ensure only

277

confident SNPs and indels were identified, a Fischer’s Exact test p-value threshold of 0.05 and

278

minimum variant allele frequency of 0.75 were used. The resulting Variant Call Format files

279

were used as input to snpEff, v.4.3t (Cingolani et al., 2012), which predicted their functional

280

impacts on gene function as high, moderate, or low. To identify CN variants, the sorted bam files

281

were used as input into Control-FREEC, v9.1 (Boeva et al., 2011, 2012). The

282

coefficientOfVariation parameter was set to 0.062 and window size was automatically

283

determined by Control-FREEC. To ensure high-confidence in CN variant identification, a p-

284

value threshold of 0.05 was used for both Wilcoxon Rank Sum and Kolmogorov Smirnov tests.

285
286

Maximum likelihood molecular phylogenetics

287

To taxonomically identify the species of Aspergillus sequenced, we conducted molecular

288

phylogenetic analysis of two different loci and two different datasets. In the first analysis, the

289

nucleotide sequence of the alpha subunit of translation elongation factor EF-1, tef1 (NCBI

290

Accession: XM_745295.2), from the genome of Aspergillus fumigatus Af293 was used to extract

291

other fungal tef1 sequences from NCBI’s fungal nucleotide reference sequence database

292

(downloaded July 2020) using the blastn function from NCBI’s BLAST+, v2.3.0 (Camacho et

293

al., 2009). Tef1 sequences were extracted from the CAPA isolates by identifying their best

294

BLAST hit. Sequences from the top 100 best BLAST hits in the fungal nucleotide reference

295

sequence database and the four tef1 sequences from the CAPA isolates were aligned using

296

MAFFT, v7.402 (Katoh and Standley, 2013) using previously described parameters (Steenwyk et

297

al., 2019) with slight modifications. Specifically, the following parameters were used: --op 1.0 --

298

maxiterate 1000 --retree 1 --genafpair. The resulting alignment was trimmed using ClipKIT, v0.1

299

(Steenwyk et al., 2020b), with default ‘gappy’ mode. The trimmed alignment was then used to

300

infer the evolutionary history of tef1 sequences using IQ-TREE2 (Minh et al., 2020). The best

301

fitting substitution model—TIM3 with empirical base frequencies, allowing for a proportion of

302

invariable sites, and a discrete Gamma model (Yang, 1994; Gu et al., 1995) with four rate

303

categories (TIM3+F+I+G4)—was determined using Bayesian Information Criterion. In the

304

second analysis, the same process was used to conduct molecular phylogenetic analysis using

305

calmodulin nucleotide sequences from Aspergillus section Fumigati species and Aspergillus

306

clavatus, an outgroup taxon, using sequences from NCBI that were made available elsewhere

307

(dos Santos et al., 2020a). For calmodulin sequences, the best fitting substitution model was TNe

308

(Tamura and Nei, 1993) with a discrete Gamma model with four rate categories (TNe+G4).

309

Bipartition support was assessed using 5,000 ultrafast bootstrap support approximations (Hoang

310

et al., 2018).

311
312

To determine what strains of A. fumigatus the CAPA isolates were most similar to, we conducted

313

phylogenomic analyses using the 50 Aspergillus proteomes. To do so, we first identified

314

orthologous groups of genes across all 50 Aspergillus using OrthoFinder, 2.3.8 (Emms and

315

Kelly, 2019). OrthoFinder takes as input the proteome sequence files from multiple genomes and

316

conducts all-vs-all sequence similarity searches using DIAMOND, v0.9.24.125 (Buchfink et al.,

317

2015). Our input included 50 total proteomes: 47 were A. fumigatus, two were A. fischeri, and

318

one was A. oerlinghausenensis (Fedorova et al., 2008; Lind et al., 2017; Steenwyk et al., 2020d).

319

OrthoFinder then clusters sequences into orthologous groups of genes using the graph-based

320

Markov Clustering Algorithm (van Dongen, 2000). To maximize the number of single-copy

321

orthologous groups of genes found across all input genomes, clustering granularity was explored

322

by running 41 iterations of OrthoFinder that differed in their inflation parameter. Specifically,

323

iterations of OrthoFinder inflation parameters were set to 1.0-5.0 with a step of 0.1. The lowest

324

number ofsingle-copy orthologous groups of genes was 3,399 when using an inflation parameter

325

of 1.0; the highest number was 4,525 when using inflation parameter values of 3.8 and 4.1. We

326

used the groups inferred using an inflation parameter of 3.8.

327
328

Next, we built the phylogenomic data matrix and reconstructed evolutionary relationships among

329

the 50 Aspergillus genomes. To do so, the protein sequences from 4,525 single-copy orthologous

330

groups of genes were aligned using MAFFT, v7.402 (Katoh and Standley, 2013), with the

331

following parameters: --bl 62 --op 1.0 --maxiterate 1000 --retree 1 --genafpair. Next, nucleotide

332

sequences were threaded onto the protein alignments using function thread_dna in PhyKIT,

333

v0.0.1 (Steenwyk et al., 2020a). The resulting codon-based alignments were then trimmed using

334

ClipKIT, v0.1 (Steenwyk et al., 2020b), using the gappy mode. The resulting aligned and

335

trimmed alignments were then concatenated into a single matrix with 7,133,367 sites using the

336

PhyKIT function create_concat. To reconstruct the evolutionary history of the 50 Aspergillus

337

genomes, a single best-fitting model of sequence substitution and rate heterogeneity was

338

estimated across the entire matrix using IQ-TREE2, v.2.0.6 (Minh et al., 2020). The best-fitting

339

model was determined to be a general time reversible model with empirical base frequencies and

340

invariable sites with a discrete Gamma model with four rate categories (GTR+F+I+G4) (Tavaré,

341

1986; Gu et al., 1995; Waddell and Steel, 1997; Vinet and Zhedanov, 2011) using Bayesian

342

Information Criterion. During tree search, the number of candidate trees maintained during

343

maximum likelihood tree search was increased from five to ten. Five independent searches were

344

conducted and the tree with the best log-likelihood score was chosen as the ‘best’ phylogeny.

345

Bipartition support was evaluated using 5,000 ultrafast bootstrap approximations (Hoang et al.,

346

2018).

347
348

Biosynthetic gene cluster prediction

349

To predict BGCs in the genomes of A. fumigatus strains Af293 and the CAPA isolates, gene

350

boundaries inferred by MAKER were used as input into antiSMASH, v4.1.0 (Weber et al.,

351

2015). Using a previously published list of genes known to encode BGCs in the genome of A.

352

fumigatus Af293 (Lind et al., 2017), BLAST-based searches using an expectation value

353

threshold of 1e-10 were used to identify BGCs implicated in modulating host biology using

354

NCBI’s BLAST+, v2.3.0 (Camacho et al., 2009). Among predicted BGCs that did not match the

355

previously published list, we further examined their evolutionary history if at least 50% of genes

356

showed similarity to species outside of the genus Aspergillus, which is information provided in

357

the antiSMASH output. Using these criteria, no evidence suggestive of horizontally acquired

358

BGCs from distant relatives was detected.

Infection of Galleria mellonella

361

Survival curves (n=12/strain) of Galleria mellonella infected with CAPA isolates A, B, C, and

362

D. Phosphate buffered saline (PBS) without asexual spores (conidia) was administered as a

363

negative control. A log-rank test was used to examine strain heterogeneity followed by pairwise

364

comparisons with Benjamini-Hochberg multi-test correction (Benjamini and Hochberg, 1995).

365

All the selected larvae of Galleria mellonella were in the final (sixth) instar larval stage of

366

development, weighing 275–330 milligram. Fresh conidia from each strain were harvested from

367

minimal media (MM) plates in PBS solution and filtered through a Miracloth (Calbiochem). For

368

each strain, the spores were counted using a hemocytometer and the stock suspension was done

369

at 2 × 108 conidia/milliliter. The viability of the administered inoculum was determined by

370

plating a serial dilution of the conidia on MM medium at 37°C. A total of 5 microliters (1 × 106

371

conidia/larva) from each stock suspension was inoculated per larva. The control group was

372

composed of larvae inoculated with 5 microliters of PBS to observe the killing due to physical

373

trauma. The inoculum was performed by using Hamilton syringe (7000.5KH) via the last left

374

proleg. After infection, the larvae were maintained in petri dishes at 37°C in the dark and were

375

scored daily. Larvae were considered dead by presenting the absence of movement in response to

376

touch.

377
378

Growth assays

379

To examine growth conditions of the CAPA isolates and reference strains Af293 and A1163,

380

plates were inoculated with 104 spores per strain and allowed to grow for five days on solid MM

381

or MM supplemented with various concentrations of osmotic (sorbitol, NaCl), cell wall (congo

382

red, calcofluor white and caspofungin), and oxidative stress agents (menadione and t-butyl) at

383

37°C. MM had 1% (weight / volume) glucose, original high nitrate salts, trace elements, and a

384

pH of 6.5; trace elements, vitamins, and nitrate salts compositions follow standards described

385

elsewhere (Käfer, 1977). To correct for strain heterogeneity in growth rates, radial growth in

386

centimeters in the presence of stressors was divided by radial growth in centimeters in the

387

absence of the stressor.

Information on CAPA isolates B, C, and D is from (Koehler et al., 2020), where the isolates were first described. CAPA isolate A is

709

being reported for the first time. Supportive only antiviral treatment indicates no specific antiviral treatment was given. Abbreviations

710

are as follows: BW: body weight; IV: Intravenous; kg: kilogram; mg: milligram.

Figure 2. Phylogenomics confirms CAPA isolates are Aspergillus fumigatus and mutational

725

spectra among genetic determinants of virulence. (A) Phylogenomic analysis of a

726

concatenated matrix of 4,525 single-copy orthologous groups genes (sites: 7,133,367) confirmed

727

CAPA isolates are A. fumigatus. Furthermore, CAPA isolates are closely related to reference

728

strains A1163 and Af293. Bipartitions with less than 85% ultrafast bootstrap approximation

729

support were collapsed. (B) Genome-wide SNPs, indels, and CN variants were filtered for those

730

present in genetic determinants of virulence. Thereafter, the number of genetic determinants of

731

virulence with high impact polymorphisms were identified. The number known to increase or

732

decrease virulence in null mutants was determined thereafter.

Figure 3. CAPA isolates have BGCs encoding the toxic small molecule gliotoxin. Gliotoxin

735

is known to contribute to virulence of A. fumigatus. The genomes of CAPA isolates of A.

736

fumigatus contain biosynthetic gene clusters known to encode gliotoxin. Note, the BGC of

737

CAPA A was split between two contigs and therefore the BGC is hypothesized to be present.

Figure 4. Strain heterogeneity among CAPA isolates. CAPA isolates and reference strains

741

Af293 and CEA17 virulence significantly varied in the Galleria moth model of disease (p <

742

0.001; log-rank test). Pairwise examinations revealed CAPA D was significantly more virulent

743

than all other strains (Benjamini-Hochberg adjusted p-value < 0.01 when comparing CAPA

744

isolate D to another isolate; log-rank test). Growth of CAPA isolates and references strains

745

Af293 and CEA17 in the presence of (B) osmotic, (C) cell wall, and (D) oxidative stressors.

746

Growth differences between CAPA isolates and reference strains Af293 and CEA17 were

747

observed across all growth conditions (p < 0.001; multi-factor ANOVA). Pairwise differences

748

were assessed using the post-hoc Tukey Honest Significant Differences test and were only

749

observed for growth in the presence of CFW at 25 µg/mL (p < 0.001; Tukey Honest Significant

750

Differences test) in which the CAPA isolates did not grow as well as the reference isolates. To

751

correct for strain heterogeneity in growth rates, radial growth in centimeters in the presence of

752

stressors was divided by radial growth in centimeters in the absence of the stressor (MM only).

753

Abbreviations of cell wall stressors are as follows: CFW: calcofluor white; CR: congo red; CSP:

caspofungin. Growth in the presence of other stressors is summarized in Supplementary Figure
